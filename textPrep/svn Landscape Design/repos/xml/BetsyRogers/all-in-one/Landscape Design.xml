<head><hi rend="bold">FOREWORD</hi></head>
<p>The building of Central Park according to the vision of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux is one of the great political and cultural achievements of the American people. That the democratic experiment of a public park had succeeded so well and for so long seemed to constitute a mandate for its preservation and rebuilding in <date when="1979">1979</date> when Mayor <name type="pname">Edward I. Koch</name> appointed me to be the first Central Park administrator and Commissioner <name type="pname">Gordon J. Davis</name> helped me to found the Central Park Conservancy. As the studies of the Con-<lb/>
servancy staff and consultants on the park's management and restoration plan went forward in the early <date when="1980">1980</date>s, I wanted to understand better the landscape tradition of which Central Park is a part and to learn more about the history of landscape design that preceded and followed it.</p>
<p>During this period, I read books and articles that were beginning to appear in the area of garden history, thanks in part to the work of Elizabeth Blair MacDougall, former director of the program of landscape studies at Dumbarton Oaks in <name type="place">Washington</name>, D.C., and her successor, <name type="pname">John Dixon Hunt</name>, who now serves as the chairman of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>. As editor of the international quarterly <hi rend="italic">Studies in the History of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, formerly the Journal of Garden History,</hi> Professor Hunt has actively promoted the historiography of landscape design both through his own work and in the scholarship that he has encouraged with the symposia he has organized, the papers he has published, and the books he has encouraged and authored. Because of the work of <name type="pname">MacDougall</name>, <name type="pname">Hunt</name>, and several other contemporary landscape historians, including <name type="pname">David Coffin</name>, who pioneered the study of landscape design as a branch of art history at Princeton University, facile assumptions have been overturned and understanding deepened in a heretofore barely considered field of serious study. Further, archaeologists and historians have brought to light much new information that deserves to be synthesized in a comprehensive survey that will allow a comparative analysis of styles and periods and provide an understanding of the cultural values that have informed landscape design in different times and places.</p>
<p>As serious scholarship was emerging in the area of landscape studies, new works on urbanism were also being published. The late Spiro Kostof in particular stands out as a writer who stimulated understanding of the design of cities as large-scale, long-term landscape projects. Reading his works and those of other authors, I began to see a reciprocity of influence between cities, parks, and gardens and to understand that in addition to being part of a continuum of design sensibility, all three categories of landscape were almost always subject to a prevailing Zeitgeist.</p>
<p>Everywhere and always humanity's desire to reflect cosmological understanding, to perfect nature, and to order the physical circumstances of life is strong. To understand better the cultural ethos reflected in the land-<lb/>
scapes I wished to describe I have read history, philosophy, science, and certain important works of literature. Readings in these areas, I believe, reinforce the assumption that everything we see reflecting human presence in nature has its origins in the mind and its cultural constructs. Whether reflecting deep religious convictions, economic motives, or passing fancies, art is always imbedded in the prevailing cultural values of a certain group of people at a particular period in history. Thus, ideological forces guide the minds and hands of those who shape space and, through design, give meaning to place. This representation of ideas in the built environment occurs sometimes with intent but often unconsciously. Thus, so-called vernacular landscapes have as much cultural significance as artfully contrived ones for those who care to observe and reflect upon the scenery of everyday life.</p>
<p>In making this intellectual journey I have had the encouragement of family members and the friends who have heard, read, and constructively criticized my thoughts and ideas. First and foremost, I wish to thank my husband, Ted, who has deferred alternative vacation itineraries in favor of travel excursions in the service of this book and who has listened to many groping ideas and glimmers of understanding along the way. In addition, I owe special thanks to four distinguished historians whose friendship and belief in my project's value have
<pb n="17"/>
<pb n="17" type="orig"/>
assisted me greatly. They are <name type="pname">Frances H. Kennedy</name>, <name type="pname">Roger G. Kennedy</name>, <name type="pname">Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz</name>, and <name type="pname">Daniel Horowitz</name>. In particular, <name type="pname">Frances Kennedy</name>, who is also a noted conservationist, gave me invaluable advice and introductions to others who were helpful. <name type="pname">Helen Horowitz</name> provided firm encouragement, insist-<lb/>
ing that I continue working toward publication at the point when the effort seemed most daunting. Then, as the book neared completion, she read the manuscript and made several helpful suggestions that improved its structure and narrative flow. I also thank my friend Ned O'Gorman for reading several chapters with a poet's ear for language and a gardener's eye for landscape.</p>
<p>Another friend, Carol Krinsky, professor of art history at New York University and author of several books on architecture, gave a close reading of the entire penultimate draft of my manuscript. By taking seriously my plea to be treated as a student, Carol served as an additional editor, penciling numerous mar-<lb/>
ginal comments and queries that forced me to substantively rethink facts and points of view throughout. <name type="pname">Reuben Rainey</name>, professor of landscape architecture at the University of <name type="place">Virginia</name> School of Architecture, also read the manuscript in its entirety and gave me several key suggestions for its improvement. I am particularly grateful for the kindness and generosity of these two important first readers and hasten to make the usual author's disclaimer on their behalf: They are entirely innocent of any errors that may remain in my text.</p>
<p>The same is true for the several other scholars who have read individual chapters in the areas of their expertise. Chapter One benefited from the eyes and mind of the Egyptologist Patrick Cardon. For another reading of that chapter I am indebted to David Hurst Thomas, curator of North American Archaeology at the American Museum of Natural History, and to his associate and wife, <name type="pname">Lorann Pendleton</name>, director of the Nels Nelson North American Archaeology Laboratory, for their invaluable knowledge of, and advice on other resources for, understanding the Native American landscape. I am further grateful to my friend Dave Warren, who is a member of the <name type="pname">Santa Clara Pueblo</name>, for also reading Chapter One and expanding my per-<lb/>
ception of the sensory dimensions and cosmological underpinnings of prehistoric, early ancient, and con-<lb/>
temporary Native American place making and to <name type="pname">Khristaan Villela</name>, director of the Thaw Art History Center and assistant professor at the College of <name type="pname">Santa Fe</name>, for his thoughtful comments. <name type="pname">Rina Swentzell</name>, the Pueb-<lb/>
loan architectural historian, critiqued this chapter and made me understand more fully the sense she shares with many other Native Americans of the sacredness of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> nature, not merely certain important sites. Fur-<lb/>
ther, I wish to thank <name type="pname">Bradley T. Lepper</name>, curator of archaeology at the Ohio Historical Center in Columbus, for introducing me to the Mound Builders of southern Ohio. <name type="pname">Duane Anderson</name>, director of the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture of the Museum of <name type="place">New Mexico</name> in <name type="pname">Santa Fe</name>, gave my material on prehistoric and living Native American cultures a final, constructive reading, and Laura Hold, the librarian of the Laboratory of Anthropology at the Museum of <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, guided me to relevant materials on the archaeology of the Americas. Writer, artist, and preservationist Nikos Stavroulakis was a most helpful host as I studied Minoan sites on his native island, Crete.</p>
<p>I thank <name type="pname">Peter J. Holliday</name>, professor of history of art and classical archaeology, <name type="place">California</name> State Uni-<lb/>
versity, Long Beach, for the careful and constructive reading he gave of Chapter Two. I first saw the <name type="place">Athe-<lb/>
nian Acropolis</name> and <name type="place">Agora</name> in the company of classical scholar <name type="pname">Avi Sharon</name>, who provided many useful insights into the history and cultural meaning of these important spaces. Chapter Three benefited from the scrutiny of Steven Murray, professor of art history and noted medieval architectural historian at Columbia University, as well as from the assistance of two Islamists, <name type="pname">D. Fairchild Ruggles</name>, visiting assistant professor in the departments of architecture and landscape architecture, Cornell University, and <name type="pname">Behula Shah</name>, the director of landscape studies at Chatham College. All of these specialists were generous with their time and advice, and I was educated by their patient coaching.</p>
<p>Guy Walton, professor of fine arts, <name type="place">New York</name> University, and author and authority on French Renais-<lb/>
sance and seventeenth-century gardens, read Chapters Four and Five, and his suggestions regarding their improvement were invaluable. <name type="pname">Tracy Ehrlich</name>, assistant professor of Art History at Colgate University, has particular expertise in the area of the Italian villa garden, and her reading of these same two chapters was equally helpful. Magnus Olausson, National Museum, <name type="place">Sweden</name>, read the section on Drottningholm Palace gardens in Chapter Six and kindly met with me, enlarging my perspective on the relationship of Swedish

<p>Landscape architect Joseph Disponzio, a former colleague in the New York City Department of Parks and my teaching assistant in the course I taught in landscape design history at Columbia University in <date when="1991">1991</date>, is a now an assistant professor of landscape architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design. His knowl-<lb/>

<p>I wish to thank <name type="pname">Kendall H. Brown</name>, assistant professor in the Department of Art, <name type="place">California</name> State Uni-<lb/>
versity at Long Beach, and a former editor for the Macmillan <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Art,</hi> for reading Chapter Eight from the perspective of a East Asian specialist. <name type="pname">John Major</name>, East Asian scholar, author, anthologist, and coauthor of a guide to world literature also read Chapter Eight, and his knowledge of the Chinese and Jap-<lb/>
anese languages and cultures was for me an important asset. In addition, his suggestions regarding particu-<lb/>
lar poems and novels have illuminated my understanding of some relationships between literature and landscape design while also giving me many hours of pleasurable reading. <name type="pname">Kenji Wako</name>, associate professor in the depart-<lb/>
ment of Environmental Planning at Osaka University, provided some pertinent corrections to my manuscript as did <name type="pname">Yoshiko Nihei</name>, who also did the excellent picture research responsible for many of the illustrations in Chapter Eight. Finally, I thank Stephanie Wada, associate curator with the <name type="pname">Mary</name> and <name type="pname">Jackson Burke</name> Foundation and a specialist in the art of <name type="place">Japan</name>, for a final reading of this material.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Charles Beveridge</name>, series editor of the Frederick Law Olmsted Papers and a professor in the department of history, American University, <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, read Chapter Nine. This proved most helpful, as his intimate knowledge of the accomplishments of Olmsted and his partner Calvert Vaux surpasses my own long and appreciative familiarity with their work. <name type="pname">David Schuyler</name>, professor of American Studies at <name type="pname">Frank-<lb/>
lin</name> and Marshall College and also an editor of the Frederick Law Olmsted Papers, has special knowledge of the nineteenth-century American metropolitan landscape and is an authority on <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson Down-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">David Streatfield</name>, professor of landscape architecture at the University of <name type="place">Washington</name> and an authority on the gardens of <name type="place">California</name>, gave me valuable insights into this region's role in the history of landscape design. I also offer thanks to George Brumder for hosting my tour of the gardens of Pasadena and arranging access to several private estates in Santa Barbara. Garden designer <name type="pname">Willem Wirtz</name> guided me around several private and public gardens in Palm Beach, <name type="place">Florida</name>, and I am grateful for his impressive store of knowledge of that community's landscape history, past and present.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Lance Neckar</name>, professor and associate dean of the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of <name type="place">Minnesota</name>, read Chapter Thirteen and provided constructive commentary on my treat-<lb/>

Irwin Miller</name> garden and related points of interest in Columbus, Indiana. George Waters, editor of <hi rend="italic">Pacific Horticulture</hi> magazine was a similarly instructive guide to the Donell Garden in <name type="place">Sonoma</name>, <name type="place">California</name>, and other nearby landscapes of the modern era. I am indebted to Gordon and Carole Hyatt for their many kindnesses to me when I was visiting Naumkeag in the Berk-<lb/>
shires. Because of the gracious assistance of <name type="pname">Ronaldo Maia</name>, I was accompanied by the knowledgeable Brazilian horticulturist Cynthia Zanotto Salvador on a tour of several of the modernist landscapes created by <name type="pname">Roberto Burle Marx</name>, which I also discuss in Chapter Thirteen. Chapter Fourteen benefited from an explanatory tour through the newly completed Animal Kingdom park in Walt Disney World in <name type="place">Orlando</name>, <name type="place">Florida</name>, with <name type="pname">Paul Comstock</name>, the head of landscape design within the Disney Company's Imagineering division.</p>
<p>When I was writing Chapter Fifteen, the artist <name type="pname">Nancy Holt</name> granted me an interview in which I learned a great deal about the process, both conceptual and technical, of producing art on a landscape scale. From her I also gained greater understanding of the role of her late husband, <name type="pname">Robert Smithson</name>, in the origins of

<pb n="19" type="orig"/>
the Earthworks movement. <name type="pname">Charles Jencks</name> was similarly kind in welcoming me to Portrack Garden in Dumfrieshire, <name type="place">Scotland</name>, and I thank Alistair Clark, the head gardener there, for his discussion of this land-<lb/>
scape work in progress. I am also grateful to Ian Hamilton Findlay for allowing me to spend a morning at Little <name type="place">Sparta</name>, his poetical landscape creation in Lanarkshire, <name type="place">Scotland</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Henry J. Stern</name>, commissioner of the <name type="place">New York</name> City Department of Parks and Recreation, has instilled in the agency over which he has presided during two mayoral administrations a strong sense of its history. <name type="pname">Jonathan Kuhn</name>, the agency's director of art and antiquities, provided helpful answers to several questions regarding the department's past as well as access to the material in its archives. I am grateful as well to Jane Weissmann, former director of Operation Green Thumb, and to Andrew Stone, director of the <name type="place">New York</name> City Land Project for the Trust for Public Land, who furnished me with materials and information relating to the community gardens movement discussed in Chapter Sixteen.</p>
<p>A book such as this one would be impossible without the patient research and insightful discoveries of these scholars, professional designers, and administrators as well as others listed in my bibliography. Their research, publications, and practice in the related fields of landscape design history and landscape restoration have made a fresh survey both necessary and possible. The lectures of my Yale professors, Vin-<lb/>
cent Scully and Christopher Tunnard, were, I am sure, partly responsible for my abiding enthusiasm for architecture, landscape, and urban design, an enthusiasm that was nourished by my friendship with the cultural geographer <name type="pname">J. B. Jackson</name>. Charles McLaughlin's loan of his thesis manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The Selected Let-<lb/>
ters of Frederick Law Olmsted</hi> when I was doing research for <hi rend="italic">Frederick Law Olmsted's <name type="place">New York</name></hi> in the days before photocopying machines, computers, or the subsequent publication of the multivolume Olmsted papers (an enterprise that he still supervises with fellow historian Charles Beveridge) stands out as an act of scholarly generosity and personal friendship for which I will always be grateful.</p>
<p>Other special friends include Sara Cedar Miller, the Central Park Conservancy historian and photog-<lb/>
rapher, who gave me invaluable help when this book was still in its infancy, and <name type="pname">Lane Addonizio</name>, my City-<lb/>
scape Institute colleague, who assisted in its final production. Without Sara's skills I could not have built the slide lectures from which the book germinated, and Lane's fine organizational ability kept both our office and this project on course. I am particularly grateful to the LuEster Mertz Trust and to Furthermore (the Publication Program of the <name type="pname">J. M. Kaplan</name> fund); the <name type="pname">Samuel H.

<p>In Central Park I learned the value of collaboration and teamwork. That lesson has been reinforced by the people at <name type="pname">Harry N. Abrams</name>, Inc. Publisher and editor-in-chief Paul Gottlieb saw the need for a survey such as I proposed, and he allowed the book to grow beyond the specifications of our contract to its natural dimensions in terms of picture and word count. <name type="pname">John Crowley</name>, director of photographs and permissions, has been the most resourceful of picture editors, seeking out, with the help of <name type="pname">Diana Gongora</name>, images I was unable to provide and reading the manuscript carefully to assure the proper fit of pictures to text. Paulo Suzuki has brought his skills as an artist to our project and, basing his work upon earlier documents, has created a number of freshly drawn plans and perspectives to aid the reader's visualization of certain land-<lb/>
scapes discussed in the text. Elaine Banks Stainton, senior editor, has overseen the difficult process of readying the book for production. Ana Rogers is the book's designer, and her fine work speaks for itself. Our team leader has been <name type="pname">Julia Moore</name>, executive editor and director of textbook publishing, the most astute and considerate of editors. She has assured the integrity of our project at every turn, always advocating what is in the best interest of the book's intent and content rather than what is merely expedient or least costly.</p>
<p>I would like to add a final additional word of gratitude to Ted, my husband, for encouraging me to undertake this broad-scale survey in the first place and to persist in bringing it to publication. I thank him especially for sharing with me a wonderful educational adventure as we have walked together in the cities, parks, and gardens described in the following chapters and talked about the civilizations, including our own, that are responsible for the impressions we have gathered and the knowledge of place-making we have gained together.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">INTRODUCTION THE SHAPING OF SPACE; THE MEANING OF PLACE</hi></head>
<p>A history of landscape design is necessarily a history of human culture. It should be located in the broadest sense in relation to values of time and space, but also more specifically as an art-historical pursuit, seeking to demonstrate how philosophical concepts, and not only ideals of beauty, are expressed through art&#x2014;in this case, an art that modifies and shapes nature. A history of landscape design is one way of writing the history of the human mind. Therefore, while this book seeks to provide a description of the designs of specific locales, the approach is contextual. It attempts to portray landscapes as products of attitudes toward the cosmos, nature, and humanity and to show how they share elements of form and meaning with artifacts from the disciplines with which they are most intimately, and often inextricably, allied&#x2014;painting, sculpture, architecture, and the decorative arts&#x2014;as well as with literature and other means of ideological expression. It is thus a narrative of a relationship between human beings and their world and of their attempts to invest nature with purposeful order and meaning and specific places with expressive form and heightened significance.</p>
<p>The mores that stem from people's attitudes in each age and geographical region are manifested in myths, rituals, social structures, and economic pursuits. These things affect the organization of space and the design of forms within it, which in turn rationalize and institutionalize patterns of cultural behavior. In speaking of a pre-<lb/>
vailing cultural consensus, however, one must offer qualifications. The decisions of governing elites, planners, architects, and landscape designers as well as those of the builders of vernacular structures for practical purposes and everyday use occur within social contexts in which there is often a historical lag between the articulation of philosophical ideas and the creation of forms that manifest those ideas. Contrarily, a philosophy yet to be expressed may be anticipated by a physical manifestation. In both cases, a gap between ideas and cultural expression is apparent. But whether it anticipates or confirms them, design does reflect certain normative cultural values, includ-<lb/>
ing those articulated by philosophers when they offer their particular intellectual lenses through which to perceive the cosmos and the place of human beings within it.</p>
<p>Many of the landscapes discussed in this book have now vanished. Others can be mentally or physically reconstructed only from the clues offered by archaeologists. Some are mere relics of their original designs. Certain landscapes, on the other hand, show an amazing persistence over time. Still others&#x2014;the world's fair, the theme park, the shopping mall&#x2014;are products of the present era. All can be interpreted as expressions of cultural values. Moreover, because landscapes have a temporal dimension, altering with time, they can be read as palimpsests, documents in which nature's own powerful dynamic and the changing intentions of human beings over the years inscribe a historical record.</p>
<p>Since culture is always both a cause and effect of particular political, economic, and technological circum-<lb/>
stances as well as of cosmological and philosophical attitudes, each age and country leaves its own legacy, signi-<lb/>
fying in large measure its type of governance, degree of wealth, and level of construction skills, as well as its political character and religious beliefs. All of these things are given form through the tastes and talents of patrons and designers. Indeed, the tastes of patrons and the talents of designers could not be exercised in the same manner, nor would the style and iconographic content of their work be as it is, in the absence of particular combinations of governance, wealth, and technology as informed by philosophical thought. By way of example, one may say that work of the great seventeenth-century French landscape designer <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le Nôtre</name> expresses the authoritarianism of Louis XIV's regime, the prosperity of the French economy under the management of the finance minister <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste Colbert</name>, the development of new means of constructing earthworks by the military engineer S&#x00E9;bas-<lb/>
tien <name type="pname">Le Prestre de Vauban</name>, and the application of the mathematical philosophy of <name type="pname">Ren&#x00E9; Descartes</name> to the art of landscape design. To say this does not diminish our estimation of <name type="pname">Le Nôtre</name>'s genius; it merely furnishes the con-<lb/>
ditions and parameters of its flowering.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that to understand designed landscapes, as well as human attitudes toward natural ones,
<pb n="21"/>
<pb n="21" type="orig"/>
one must venture beyond the important areas of political, economic, and technological history into the realms of cosmology, religion, science, and metaphysics. The physical world, as shaped by thought and action, mirrors the human mind as a theater of myth, ritual, allegory, and reason. So, too, the mind's capacity for sensation and reflection finds expression in the shaping and furnishing of landscape space, as does the human desire for public ceremony and personal pleasure. This book traces the flow of these mental energies across time and space, examining the cultural matrices of various periods and places and the influence of these upon landscape design.</p>
<p>Landscape and religion bore a particularly close relationship to one another in prehistoric times and early antiquity, when people perceived nature and the cosmos to be pregnant with spirit forces, which they personi-<lb/>
fied as gods governing the hunt and later the fertility of the soil and the harvest. Aware of the degree to which their lives were subject to the forces of nature, prehistoric and ancient societies developed rituals of propitiation to ensure seasonal benefits, such as bountiful game, adequate rainfall, and the warmth of the sun as well as the continuation of human life through successful reproduction. The spaces in which these ceremonies took place were theaters for religious expression within a larger landscape. This is the lesson of Paleolithic cave art and the astronomical alignments of the stones at Stonehenge and other megalithic circles (see figs. 1.2, 1.3). The cosmological orientation found in the archaeological remains of temples, platforms, and pyramids in <name type="place">Egypt</name>, Mesopotamia, India, Crete, Greece, and the Americas implies a similar conclusion (see figs. 1.8,1.9,1.10,1.24, 1.27, 1.28). In such ruins, one sees how human beings expressed in landscape terms their alliance with spirit forces within the earth and how they invoked the aid of cosmic powers. There is a reciprocity between the human and the natural that honors the notion of an inherent divinity in both. Sacred sites&#x2014;mountains, lakes, and springs&#x2014;called out to these early peoples. Pyramid, ziggurat, <hi rend="italic">kiva,</hi> mound, and temple&#x2014;these were ceremonial sites, as Puebloan plazas still are.</p>
<p>The transformation of religion from the worship of animal spirit, sun, and Earth Mother to that of a pan-<lb/>
theon of deities presided over by Zeus and Apollo can be read in a selection of sacred landscapes. Ancient classical temples and their siting in the landscape reveal how Greek logic and mathematics began to transform the human bond with nature from one belief system to another. Blood sacrifice, ritual dancing, and oracular consultation as a means of invoking the cooperation of unseen forces in a precarious world did not disappear with the dawn of the Greek Classical age in the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> But alongside these practices, Greek phi-<lb/>
losophers proffered another means of shaping destiny. Reliance upon the powers of intellect in the affairs of humankind slowly assumed at least equal importance with dependence upon the forces of fate. Landscape, although still the province of propitiatory rites, was manipulated in ways that suggest a new sense of confidence in reason. This is evident on the Athenian Acropolis, where the defensible site of the earlier city, after being devastated by the Persians, was rebuilt in the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> as a religious precinct in which an architecture based upon exquisite mathematical proportions is worn like a proud crown (see fig. 2.1).</p>
<p>The power of empire and the pride of Caesars invested Hellenistic and Roman landscapes with charac-<lb/>
teristic forms of spatial composition, as well as with a more cosmopolitan and secular approach to design. Colonial cities were rationally laid out in grid plans, and in Roman ones aqueduct-fed baths and fountains as well as in basilicas, arenas, and theaters expressed imperial might and largesse. Unlike the modem city, which projected itself into the surrounding countryside, first as a centrifugal force of axes radiating outward, and later as a series of amorphous zones of expanded settlement, the ancient Roman city represented a centripetal gath-<lb/>
ering of energies into enclosed spaces: the town itself, the forum, and the inward-focused peristyle garden (see fig. 2.29). The ubiquitous reiteration of prototypical elements of Roman urbanism&#x2014;forums, basilicas, baths, theaters, arenas, libraries, roads, triumphal arches, aqueducts&#x2014;in cities linked by a vast road system through-<lb/>
out the Mediterranean world impressively demonstrated imperial might.</p>
<p>The elements of myth and ritual were elaborated as allegory in Roman times. For instance, the cave sanctuary in nature was symbolized in the artificial grotto where it served as a psychological echo chamber, a place where the human psyche found a physical link to the prehistoric world of the Earth Goddess and nature spirits. Grottoes with sculptural representations of nymphs and other subterranean spirits were installed in many villa gardens, one of the most spectacular of which was that built by the emperor Hadrian. Throughout its vast,
<pb n="22"/>
<pb n="22" type="orig"/>
now mostly vanished, decorative program of sculpture, wall painting, and mosaic, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa also pro-<lb/>
vides an early example of the associative garden, or the thematic treatment of landscape in which allegory plays a role.</p>
<p>Christians and Muslims appropriated allegory in the recurring metaphor of paradise as a garden in liter-<lb/>
rature and art. The gardens of both cultures exploited the symbolic relationship of landscape and heavenly reward. Four watercourses in Islamic gardens and four paths leading from a central fountain in Christian ones represented the four paradisaical rivers mentioned in the Quran and the Bible (see figs. 3.10, 3.25). The cool, sparkling, reflective, murmurous qualities of water in these gardens were particularly conducive to other-<lb/>
worldly contemplation and well suited to the image of paradise as a place of tranquil refreshment and beauty.</p>
<p>Allegory also plays a strong role in Renaissance and Mannerist gardens, where the myths of antiquity were revived and reinterpreted by humanist scholars. At the Villa d'Este, for example, to manifest the benef-<lb/>
icence of the owner, Cardinal d'Este, much of the garden's sculptural iconography was associated with the virtuous hero Hercules. Here and at the Villa Lante, the hunting park and country estate of Cardinal Gambara, are found symbols celebrating each cardinal's ability to fructify the land through a combination of art and nature (see figs. 4.18, 4.23). The use of allegory to glorify popes and princes can also be recognized in many seventeenth- and eighteenth-century gardens, as at Versailles, where the abundant symbols of Apollo, the sun god, refer to Louis XIV.</p>
<p>Along with this last, late use of allegory, another development was occurring that has affected the mod-<lb/>
ern world view and, with it, the approach to landscape making: the birth of systematic science and the greatly increased reliance upon reason as a governing principle in the affairs of life. The shift from belief in an earth-centered, self-contained, closed universe to a boundless one, and the consequent opening of the human mind to new metaphysical possibilities, had a profound effect on philosophy. This unharnessing of the intellect from ancient constructs found parallel physical expression in the treatment of space in landscape design. The garden remained enclosed and by definition a place set apart from its cultivated rural surroundings and wild nature (the garden being characterized since the Renaissance as "third nature," as distinguished from the agrarian landscape&#x2014;"second nature"&#x2014;and wilderness&#x2014;"first nature"), but it no longer represented itself as an enclosed space, and its axes were given apparent elongation, as if to join the actual horizon. <name type="pname">Le Nôtre</name>'s plan of the Sun King's gardens at Versailles is thus as much an expression of the opening of the mind to a new heliocentric interpretation of the universe, which was then considered coterminous with our galaxy, as it is of the confidence, optimism, and pride of <name type="place">France</name> during the first half of the reign of Louis XIV (see fig. 5.9).</p>
<p>Axial extension within the garden, in turn, provided a paradigm for city planning. This form of urban-<lb/>
ization following the layout of the town and gardens of Versailles, the international model for new and mod-<lb/>
ernizing cities, involved the construction of wide straight thoroughfares, often radiating from a prominent monument, prestigious structure, or central public space to the far reaches of the urbanized mass and even into the countryside (see figs. 6.44,6.54). During the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, govern-<lb/>
ments sponsored grand axial plans with broad avenues and magnificent architecture and sculpture as a means of expressing their power and authority, providing better police protection, and facilitating military control of rebellious mobs. In addition, the grand thoroughfares of the monumental city served the elite for whom the invention of the lightweight, spring-hung carriage had made vehicular promenading an important social pas-<lb/>
time. Also toward these ends, ancient and medieval town walls were torn down and converted into boulevards. This occurred first in <name type="place">France</name>, where the birth of the modern nation-state rendered obsolete the enclosed forti-<lb/>
fied city.</p>
<p>As Isaac Newton was solidifying the basis of the Enlightenment and confirming the role of reason in human thought, John Locke asserted that all knowledge of the world must rest on sensory awareness. This concept of the mind as an instrument for inductive reasoning and a theater for personal experience, rather than as a receptacle for revealed Truth and immutable law, helped change the character of landscape design in the eighteenth century. Respect for the potential of landscape to produce mental sensations through association caused garden designers to gather into their repertoire of effects images of a poetic and painterly nature, espe-<lb/>
cially at first those that evoked the antique past through classical forms and pastoral Arcadian motifs. The garden became no longer a stage for the display of power, an arena of social interaction, but a place for solitary
<pb n="23"/>
<pb n="23" type="orig"/>
or companionable reflection and contemplation. Locke's philosophy thus provides a key for those who would ponder the meaning of miniature temples, sham ruins, grottoes, and grazing deer in an eighteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury English landscape park (see figs. 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.9, 7.13).</p>
<p>Though much earlier in its origins, the East Asian garden was equally a place of poetic association and friendship. As in <name type="place">England</name>, in China and <name type="place">Japan</name> the associative potential of garden scenery was an important design consideration. In China, the talents of poet, painter, and garden designer were fused, often in the same persons. These artists enjoyed an especially close relationship with nature, and their compositions evoke the precipitous peaks of certain mountainous parts of their country (see fig. 8.3). Derived from China, Japanese garden design is also premised upon a great deal of naturalistic rockwork, although the carefully arranged, flatter, less contorted stones in Japanese gardens understandably reflect more that country's island scenery than the topography of its mainland neighbor. The rocks in both Chinese and Japanese gardens are replete with symbolical associations (see fig. 8.24). Plants, too, enjoy a symbolic function, and appreciation of selected species, such as peonies, chrysanthemums, plum trees, and bamboo is focused and intense.</p>
<p>In the late eighteenth century, pathos and memory came to play an important role in Western garden design as Romanticism replaced classical order as the dominant cultural impulse of Western civilization. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's belief in the importance of commonly accessible personal experience in nature and in the virtues of a democratically organized citizenry had important consequences for landscape design. Gradually, the focus of Lockean sensation was transferred from the literary and political to the patriotic and personal, and the Western garden became an arena in which to honor heroes of state and a place for the repose of the dead. This accounts for the affective and often elegiac character of the Picturesque style and why it made an appropriate design idiom for the nineteenth-century rural cemetery (see fig. 9.27). The popularity of Rousseau's philosophy, which gained strength through the several revolutionary movements that enfranchised a much larger segment of the general populace during this turbulent era, helps explain the origins of the public parks movement.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the birth of Romanticism and the revolutionary forces growing out of it and leading to the development of nationalistic capitalist democracies and communist states, the Industrial Revolution provided the cultural dynamic that made possible the accelerating advances in machine technology that continue to propel contemporary life. Over the past two hundred years, democracy's "right to life, liberty and happiness," including the enjoyment of private property, has promoted personal pleasure as a powerful principle in the field of landscape design, as in other areas of life. The advances of egalitarianism have caused the continued transformation of the pleasure garden, once the exclusive domain of the aristocracy, into a recreational preserve for the masses.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution profoundly altered the nature of urban life, especially as transportation advances induced a new mobility within and between cities, and time and distance assumed new meaning. <name type="place"><name type="place">Paris</name></name>'s radical reorganization in the second half of the nineteenth century reflects this Machine Age trans-<lb/>
formation (see fig. 10.7). The parks movement and the development of the residential suburb in <name type="place">America</name> in the second half of the nineteenth century express a nostalgia for the agrarian past that was concomitant with industrialism and the growth of cities in the modern era. During this period and continuing to the present day, the market forces of a globalizing culture have promoted the eclectic character of landscape design in the West. In the absence of a general cultural consensus since at least the beginning of the nineteenth century, design has been increasingly viewed as a commodity, a mere matter of consumer taste, as expressed in the casual intermingling of various past styles (see fig. 11.4).</p>
<p>Twentieth-century modernism attempted a radical reinvention of architectural design, with landscape architecture, somewhat hesitantly at first, joining forces in forging a vocabulary that aimed to express ratio-<lb/>
nality and function (see figs. 12.19, 13.23). But rational planning and functionalism were inadequate to suppress historical associations, and the result of the obsession with history that continues to the present time is reflected in stylistic multiplicity and eclectic design. In this context, Modernism, too, became a style, merely another design option.</p>
<p>Catering to popular taste, the creators of world's fairgrounds, theme parks, and shopping malls applied narratives of history and fantasy to landscape with the aid of media technology and mass-marketing tech-<lb/>

niques (see fig. 14.9). The modern self-theming of cities to attract tourists is a manifestation of this trend, one in which historic preservation, in traversing the distance between reverence for the past and profitability, sometimes takes a pratfall into the realm of parody. Nevertheless, some efforts to establish serious historical meaning within the contemporary designed landscape and to preserve nature and create psychologically resonant metaphorical representations of it still manage to heighten the spiritual bond between humanity and the built and natural environments.</p>
<p>A comprehensive survey such as this is necessarily a dialogue across the centuries and across the globe. In tracing patterns of influence, it is apparent that form follows culture, but, once developed, form often follows form. By example, the revival of the forms of Greek and Roman art and architecture during the Renaissance and later periods of Western history exemplifies the ways in which people of other eras and in other places have found in the forms forged in antiquity an expressive design vocabulary for their own particular societal aspirations. Transmission may also occur more directly, moving along the paths of military adventure and trade, as when the formal innovations of one country are exported to, or imported by, another through conquest and assimilation.</p>
<p>Such was the case from the fourth through the second centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> as <name type="pname">Alexander</name> the Great's far-flung Hellenistic empire carried Greek forms to the farthest reaches of the Mediterranean basin and beyond to Persia. Similarly, in early sixteenth-century <name type="place">France</name>, the development of the French Renaissance garden was based upon direct imitation of <name type="place">Italian</name> Renaissance garden principles and the immigration to <name type="place">France</name> of Italian garden designers following the Neapolitan campaign of the French king, Charles VIII. But just as the Japanese assimilated Chinese garden concepts along with Buddhism beginning in the sixth century and then developed out of this beginning their own indigenous approach to garden making, so too did those who followed the French Renaissance garden designers evolve from their forms ones that were distinctive to French culture, which were subsequently adopted, adapted, and altered by others elsewhere.</p>
<p>Traditionalism, or historicization, for its own sake, as stylistic imitation of past forms simply for the period qualities they convey and aesthetic characteristics they display, can be explained as part of a widespread reactionary attitude toward the Industrial Age on the part of some since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The reverse of modernism, this attempt to cherish and derive emotional satisfaction from association with what is venerable and vanishing is a strategy for denying accelerating change and the Faustian transformation of the world through technology.</p>
<p>Following the currents of classicism and Neoclassicism, the growth of Romanticism and the dissemina-<lb/>
tion of the Picturesque style, the development of various urban planning models from the Hellenistic grid to the contemporary edge city&#x2014;these are some of the tasks of a broad-based landscape history. The pursuit of these landscape design developments will enable us to see, among other things, how the inherently autocratic style of city planning favored by European monarchs in the seventeenth century could be used in laying out <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>1, the capital of a new democratic nation in the eighteenth, or how the adaptation of the English Picturesque style, developed by and for aristocratic estate owners in the eighteenth century, became the paradigm for the nineteenth-century public park.</p>
<p>Landscape design is fundamentally a relationship between people and place, a partnership between art and nature, and, increasingly, between art, nature, and technology. Art and technology have the power to modify nature, but landscape design operates within the laws of growth and decay that govern all animate life. The mystery of nature as an independent force&#x2014;bounteous and generous, overpowering and destructive&#x2014; makes the experience and practice of landscape design both spiritually rewarding and scientifically challeng-<lb/>
ing. Its historiography is made especially difficult by the natural tendency to view past cultures through a contemporary cultural lens. Our attempt here is to penetrate, however imperfectly, the consciousness both of human beings who are like ourselves and of those who are mentally and spiritually very different from us.</p>
<p>In so doing, we must stress that the separation of myth, religion, philosophy, and science into independent modes of perception, inquiry, and belief is a product of the modern mind. The compartmentalization of knowl-<lb/>
edge and the promotion of scientific rationalism as the primary mode of investigating reality and constructing a world view in the West have devalued intimate experience and empirical knowledge. Although psychology,
<pb n="25"/>
<pb n="25"/>
especially the psychology of <name type="pname">Carl Jung</name>, has given us insight into the collective unconscious and the role of myth and archetypes as bearers of meaning, insight is not the same thing as the wholehearted belief that integrates all social purpose&#x2014;religious, political, economic, architectural&#x2014;in a holistic way as it did for some prehistoric and ancient societies, as well as for later ones that subscribed to the ideals of Christianity, humanism, rationalism, or other widely shared systems of thought.</p>
<p>Today we are both exhilarated and disquieted. We thrill to the boons of technology and the adventure of the Information Age in which we are taking part, and yet we experience anomie and the psychological <hi rend="italic">dis-location</hi> of an increasingly migratory way of life. The ease of replication within industrial capitalist economies fosters mime-<lb/>
sis of time and space whether in the form of "historic" villages, theme parks, malls, restaurants, resorts, or museum reconstructions. These environmental simulations of the long ago and the far away, as well as the purely fantastic, aided by photography and cinema, are now universally marketed and displayed to mass audiences. A kaleidoscope of juxtaposed, heterogeneous images of place is also made accessible by the Internet. The ease with which images of period and place are now distributed has the effect of commercializing the original prototypes, turning them, where they still exist, into famous clich&#x00E9;s and tourist icons.</p>
<p>The term <hi rend="italic">urban sprawl</hi> has gained currency and disapprobation because we have invented a new kind of city, amorphous and without the mythic, religious, or even political foundations that cities have historically enjoyed. Business chains and franchise operations proliferate along commercial strips, transforming the locally particular into the repetitiously familiar. This may give the brand-name consumer and mobile traveler assurance, but the increasingly predictable, homogeneous, loosely urbanized environment equally induces boredom and&#x2014; in a very prosaic and literal way&#x2014;d&#x00E9;j&#x00E0; vu.</p>
<p>As accelerating mobility and speed of communications continue to shrink distance and collapse time, place becomes increasingly provisional and temporary. Increasingly rootless, we articulate concepts valorizing com-<lb/>
munity. This is so because humans are in a fundamental way place-making animals, revealing in this act their individual and collective dreams (see figs. 16.3,16.5). The landscapes that we create are combinations of artifice and nature, and in designing them people of every period have revealed a great deal about their cultural values while demonstrating the perennial exigencies of life and our universal need for water, food, and shelter. Perhaps as we reanimate our spiritual selves, develop new culturally sustaining myths, and reunite science with religion and philosophy, we will be able to create places that are life-sustaining in a truer sense than now. For, as the twentieth-century French philosopher Gaston Bachelard posited, when we examine space in terms of psychology and phenomenology we find that we are still place-bound creatures, carrying in the recesses of our memories personal histories of spaces we have inhabited and imagined. Further, we carry "placeness" in our genes and in our sensory apparatus as human animals, and because biological nature is still the matrix of our existence we long to feel at one with the natural world.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the origins of the Romantic movement and the romanticization of nature and of prehistoric and aboriginal peoples as "noble savages" were concurrent with the Industrial Revolution. Machine technology has introduced into the world an enormously potent, self-referential set of systems that affect us in ways that are at the same time obvious and incomprehensible. "The machine in the garden," to borrow the met-<lb/>
aphor of Leo Marx for the uneasy alliance of technology and nature, has taken up permanent residence in human consciousness, and perhaps without realizing that this is occurring, we may be witnessing the moment in Western history when industrial technology becomes affirmatively integrated with art and nature.</p>
<p>The alternative, unfortunately, is greater environmental degradation and planetary destruction, a possibility we have only recently taken seriously. Now, as the world becomes more populous and human life increasingly dependent upon the machine-built environment, we develop campaigns to protect wilderness. Our old relation to wilderness having been inverted, it is now at the mercy of human politics. Inseparable from the forces of energy that power our machines and the new reality we are creating, most of us desperately want to harmonize our fast-<lb/>
paced future with our past, enjoying the benefits of new sources of energy and the fruits of technology while honoring our own human nature and the longing for place and nature that is encoded into our beings. Our success in this endeavor will depend on many things, including an understanding of the rich psychological and mytho-<lb/>
poeic relationship of human beings to landscape throughout history.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>hroughout the ages landscapes have reflected cosmological notions underlying one of humanity's great imponderables: Where are we? How was the world created, and what is the place and fate of human beings within the contexts of space and time?</p>
<p>In this preliminary chapter our task is not to study, as we will later, the landscapes that express the creation stories of scrip-<lb/>
ture-based religions such as Islam or Christianity, nor those that serve as paradigms of cosmological reason such as the gardens of seventeenth-century <name type="place">France</name>, nor ones that reflect a contem-<lb/>
porary cosmology based upon the science of physics and recent discoveries subsumed under the term chaos theory. Here we must examine something more basic, the rootedness in the human psyche of certain fundamental spatial constructs that relate to our upright posture, directional movement, desire to locate our-<lb/>
selves in space in ways that are charged with societal meaning, and our yearning for connection with the infinite and eternal.</p>
<p>Myth, religion, philosophy, and science are all rooted in cosmogony, the attempt to explain the creation of cosmos out of chaos&#x2014;the transformation of primal disorder and confusion into a universe that is systematically arranged, harmonious, whole. By these means, human beings in all times and all places have sought to confer meaning and perceive structure within the nat-<lb/>
ural world. Only through the human mind's dynamic transfor-<lb/>
mation over the previous several centuries&#x2014;a phenomenon of restless revisionism more characteristic of Western society than of other world cultures&#x2014;have myth, religion, philosophy, and science been teased apart and made separate spheres of belief and knowledge. Here we must try to understand how non-West-<lb/>
ern peoples in widely separated parts of the earth and in periods of time both vastly removed and continuing to the present have created landscape forms of astonishing universality in cultures&#x2014; both prehistoric and extant&#x2014;where cosmology reflects a fusion of mythic, religious, philosophic, and scientific thought.</p>
<p>Over time, the development of geometry, surveying, and structural mechanics gave birth to the art of architecture. But here, too, we must be careful not to assign the technical special-<lb/>
ization and the epistemological segmentation of modern Western culture to societies of the distant past who lived long before many of the practices and values of Western industrial society were established or to those that live today outside its precepts. Fur-<lb/>
ther, in considering our topic, the history of landscape design, it is especially important to understand that the perception of vol-<lb/>
umetric, terrestrial space&#x2014;the foundation of our enterprise in both a practical and a theoretical sense&#x2014;is hugely variable, altering with the cosmological and teleological understanding of each age.</p>
<p>To be more specific, since the Renaissance, the Western mind has presumed a spatial concept based upon perspective and a central vanishing point where all the lines of an imaginary hor-<lb/>
izontal planar grid converge. Particularly after the French math-<lb/>
ematician and philosopher <name type="pname">Ren&#x00E9; Descartes</name> (<date when="1596">1596</date>&#x2013;<date when="1650">1650</date>) expounded his theory of spatial extension&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">res extensa</hi>&#x2014;in the seventeenth century, this notion of value-neutral space as a uni-<lb/>
versal proscenium theater in which objects are arrayed in accor-<lb/>
dance with the laws of perspective has governed landscape design theory and practice. Beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century, designed landscape space in the West became explicitly pictorial. It was consciously invested with the scenic values of landscape painting, which, though less obviously perspectival than the axially geometric gardens of the seventeenth century, nevertheless remained faithful, until the advent of twentieth-cen-<lb/>
tury modernism, to the same underlying principle of pictorial representation. However, the art of such societies as the Chinese, the Byzantine, or Inuit shows that participants in these cultures were uninterested in spatial perspective, not through ignorance, but because of an entirely different attitude toward the interpre-<lb/>
tation and construction of representational space.<ref target="#CH1-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p>
<pb n="27"/>
<pb n="27" type="orig"/>
<p>The belief in spatial hierophany&#x2014;the notion that within the larger sanctity of nature some places are especially sacred&#x2014;prac-<lb/>
tically universal in prehistoric cultures and residual in some parts of the world today, militates against the assumption of a spatial continuum ordered purely by mathematics and Western theories of spatial perspective. Prehistoric and ancient peoples joined architecture and sacred forms in nature and in so doing invented, without naming it, the art of landscape design. In terms of three-di-<lb/>
mensional planning employing axes and the measurement of form and spatial distance, the landscapes they created do not merely link or give scale to terrestrial monuments but have cosmological alignment and significance. To understand place-making as a human activity it is important for us to investigate&#x2014;as best we can from contemporary Western society's vastly different, secu-<lb/>
larized, historicized point of view&#x2014;the cultural values of the first shapers of space along with those who have continued to create landscapes that reflect a similar cosmology.</p>
<p>Early societies sought survival through rituals intended to propi-<lb/>
tiate the forces of nature. In their attempts to understand the cos-<lb/>
mos and interpret the all-important seasonal rhythms of nature, these people became Earth's first astronomers. But to imply that they were scientists in the modern sense of the word is wrong; astronomy was indivisibly linked to religion. In contrast to the highly individual and personal nature of contemporary religious faith and the resolutely secular nature of modern science, the ritual and augural ceremonies of prehistoric and early ancient peoples were holistic societal practices, which took place in nature. Although quite probably they considered all of nature to be animated by spiritual forces, as members of human societies they experienced a psychological need to shape space in nature in spiritually significant ways. Almost universally, this meant establishing a relationship of form and alignment between built and natural features as well as an orientation to certain celestial reference points&#x2014;the predictable and calendrically determined positions of sun, moon, stars. These cosmologically referential landscape constructions and ceremonies were considered vital to the continuance of the communities they served. In addition, in their search for harmony with the universe, prehistoric and ancient humans assigned a presiding spiritual force to certain mountains, springs, caves, trees, and animals, ascribing to them sacred mean-<lb/>
ing. Those who subscribe to similar belief systems today invest nature with sanctity and certain sites with religious significance, a concept quite alien to others who view land in secular and util-<lb/>
itarian terms, as a commodity serving economic rather than spir-<lb/>
itual ends.</p>
<p>Paleolithic cave paintings, Neolithic stone circles, Meso-potamian ziggurats, Egyptian pyramids and obelisks, Hindu temples, Cretan nature sanctuaries, Mycenaean citadels, and the pyramids, mounds, and effigy earthworks of pre-Spanish-con-<lb/>
quest Americans&#x2014;these were all expressions of a partnership between human beings and unseen spiritual forces. The creators of these forms, who also invested their landscape settings with symbolical meaning and design intent, invoked the magical pow-<lb/>
ers of spirits&#x2014;those of the beasts whose flesh sustained them and of the gods and goddesses who controlled the cosmos and were responsible for human and animal fertility and the growth of crops. In a highly uncertain world, these creative people watched the skies, studying the rotations of celestial bodies, harbingers of the predictable annual cycle of rain and solar warmth and auguries of victory in battle. In the process, they created the first complex human societies, constructed important ceremonial centers, and evolved the world's earliest cities.</p>
<p>The built environments shaped by these early human cul-<lb/>
tures and many of those that succeeded them reflected their reli-<lb/>
gious preoccupation with the cosmos. What is most striking about these very earliest societies is their fusion of myth-based religion and scientific observation. Limited but certain in their perception of the planet and the cosmos, they rooted themselves firmly and assigned religious meaning to place. When we understand how deeply embedded cosmology once was in religious mythos, we can comprehend cosmological landscape design&#x2014;the shaping of the earth and the erection of monuments to reflect a cosmic par-<lb/>
adigm. The universality of the axis, the pyramid, and the grotto in cultures as distant in space and time as those of the ancient Near East, prehistoric <name type="place">Europe</name>, <name type="place">India</name>, and the pre-Columbian Americas makes sense when we realize that these forms express cosmic concepts that owe their similarity to their origins in the human psyche. This, rather than certain theories of cultural transmission, seems to account for the similarity of landscape constructions as widely separated in site and date as the Egyptian and Mayan pyramids.</p>
<p>The cave, especially, as sanctuary, the womb of Earth, a place of cultic mystery and ritual revitalization, occupies a priv-<lb/>
ileged place in the human imagination. Its many manifestations include the Egyptian tomb carved into the cliff face or nestled within the bowels of a pyramid, the subterranean sanctuaries of the Snake Goddess in prehistoric <name type="place">Greece</name>, the cave beneath the Pyramid of the Sun at <name type="place">Teotihuac&#x00E1;n</name> Shiva cave-temples at <name type="place">Elephanta</name>, <name type="place">Ellora</name>, and <name type="place">Salsette</name> in <name type="place">India</name>, and the <hi rend="italic">kivas</hi> of Puebloan cultures in the American Southwest. Associated with the cave is the rule of an earth goddess, which is rooted in universal myths that recognize the earth as a generative and procreative force, the fertile source of human and animal vitality. The cave, with its labyrinthine passages, suggests the intimacy of the mother's womb, the place from which life was observed to emerge. In addition, caves and crevices in the earth's surface are sources for springs, and shrines at caves or near springs are especially prev-<lb/>
alent in dry lands. Understandably, a psychological attraction toward moist mysterious openings within the earth has persisted down through the millennia. The architectural grotto in ancient Roman villa gardens, which Renaissance garden-builders revived and passed on to subsequent eras and diverse cultures, is a sophis-<lb/>
ticated version of the cave sanctuaries in which prehistoric ances-<lb/>
tors worshipped.</p>
<p>The work of <name type="pname">Mircea Eliade</name>, scholar of world religions and early myths, beliefs, and practices, confirms that among members of prehistoric and some contemporary cultures there exists the conviction that the natural world is imbued with divinity. <name type="pname">Eliade</name>
<pb n="28"/>
<pb n="28" type="orig"/>
points out that the most elemental sacred places constitute a microcosm, "a landscape of stones, water, and trees."<ref target="#CH1-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> In this way humans evoke the durable potency of stone, the fertility associated with water, and the fecundity of nature as embodied in the liv-<lb/>
ing tree. The notion of an immanent sanctity within earth and sky is culturally pervasive, and from this is derived the concept of <hi rend="italic">genius loci</hi>, spirit of place, and the idea of guardian deities of place.</p>

<figDesc><hi rend="bold">1.1. Diagram of <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi></hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>One way to explain the similarity and universality of myths and the pictorial con-<lb/>
figurations and landscape constructs that reflect them is to study the psychological theories of <name type="pname">Carl Jung</name> (<date when="1875">1875</date>&#x2013;<date when="1961">1961</date>).<ref target="#CH1-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref> According to <name type="pname">Jung</name>, archetypes&#x2014;formal images that symbolically express quintes-<lb/>
sential meanings&#x2014;cannot be directly iden-<lb/>
tified and subjected to control by the conscious mind. Therefore, they find expression in myths. Just as <name type="pname">Jung</name>'s own teaching is based upon four-bodiedness, or four states of perceiving (thinking, feeling, intuition, sensation), the archetype of quaternity as expressed in the four-part circle and the four car-<lb/>
dinal points can be found in the landscape constructions of many cultures. In addition, the Great Mother, the Tree of the World, and Paradise are examples of Jungian archetypes, and the symbol of the snake, the sphinx, and various helpful animals are also symp-<lb/>
toms of states within what <name type="pname">Jung</name> calls the collective unconscious. The metaphorical nature of landscape design and the prevalence of certain formal means of shaping space and expressing basic mythic concepts through architecture and decoration can thus be analyzed in Jungian terms as archetypal manifestations of primor-<lb/>
dial ideas that continue to resonate within the human imagination.</p>
<p>Creation myths deal with the evolution of cosmos out of chaos. Implicit in this is the act of giving form and place to objects and space. The positioning of Earth in the center of the universe and the centering of human societies within the world are funda-<lb/>
mental constructs within many early cosmologies. Cosmic center-<lb/>
ing involves awareness of three vertical strata: above, below, and a terrestrial middle plane. It also involves cardinal directionality&#x2014; the location of four principal axes along a 360&#x00B0; horizon line in accordance with the movement of the sun and various stars and planets. In diagrammatic terms, this basic image of the cosmos can be illustrated as in figure 1.1.</p>
<p>So firmly fixed is this cosmological model in the human consciousness that it appears not only in widely different parts of the world, but also in many eras, being appropriated through reli-<lb/>
gious syncretism by people of different cultures, including those adhering to Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity. Its ver-<lb/>
tical dimension is an <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi>, which acts like a center pole uniting heaven, Earth, and the underworld. Lakes are watery nether regions located just below the surface of the land, and, like caves, they are places of underworld entrance and exit. These are identi-<lb/>
fied with female procreation and spirits that reside in darkness. The underworld is also the domain of serpent deities prevalent in several cultures. Moun-<lb/>
tains, the realm of air and celestial light, are identified with sky-dwelling gods who con-<lb/>
trol cosmic order and thereby the welfare of human beings. They are sites of celestial communication between these gods and human beings occupying the intermediate terrestrial realm with its broad circular hori-<lb/>
zon.</p>
<p>The apparent east-west rotational movement of the sun across the heavens and the observation of its equinoctial position in relation to the horizon gave human beings their primary orientation on a horizontal plane. The bisection of this axis with a north-<lb/>
south one divided sky and Earth into quad-<lb/>
rants, providing an elemental framework for celestial observation and terrestrial naviga-<lb/>
tion. With these six cosmic coordinates&#x2014; east, west, north, south, zenith, and nadir&#x2014;embedded in consciousness, human societies formed settlements within the expansive earthly sphere through acts of centering.</p>
<p>The siting of places of habitation is governed by such prac-<lb/>
tical considerations as the presence of water and the arability of land. But given these limitations, when Earth was relatively unpop-<lb/>
ulated and there was available a wide range of options, cultural groups also sought to settle themselves in places perceived to have a relationship to divine power, which generally meant in alignment with cosmic coordinates and landforms associated with mythic forces. Many were attracted to karstic formations&#x2014;limestone strata riddled with caves and seeping with springs&#x2014;and to arable valleys near mountains. Often, cultural groups expended enormous human resources constructing a mountain-mimicking pyramid, ziggurat, or temple in order to establish an <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> that would firmly relate it to a cosmic deity.</p>
<p>No one cared that there were many groups and multiple <hi rend="italic">axes mundi;</hi> what mattered was a representation of the cosmic arche-<lb/>
type, consecration rites surrounding the creation of a cosmic land-<lb/>
scape, and sanctification of the site through worship. Thus centered symbolically in space, more than one city could imagine its cos-<lb/>
mically connected, temple-crowned, human-made mountain as the navel of the earth. In a similar manner, through the repetition of cosmogonic rituals, temporality was displaced by timelessness.</p>
<p>Looking at archaeological sites of former cosmological land-<lb/>
scapes today, we lack the ritual dimension that once gave them religious significance. Only in a few cultures where people still seek cosmic alignment within nature do we find ritual practices that link humans with the cosmos, as for example when dancers re-en-<lb/>
act archetypal gestures and commemorate mythical moments through choreographed movement. We may surmise, however, that all sacred landscapes were once alive with dancing and other ritu-<lb/>
als in which music and chanting dramatized the myth-based cos-<lb/>
mologies that sustained a sense of sacred order in the world.</p>

<p>During the eons of Paleolithic habitation of Earth, when a shield of ice still covered parts of the globe that are temperate today, the cunning of a tool-making and weapon-wielding being was pitted against the speed and bulk of large roaming beasts. In this Old Stone Age, the virtually trackless steppes, savannas, and forests were home to small bands of hunter-gath-<lb/>
erers who have left only slight evidence of their pres-<lb/>
ence. Because there is no written record of this time, what we know of their customs, practices, and rela-<lb/>

ors on their walls (fig. 1.2). The vitality of the paint-<lb/>
ings may derive from their association with a propitiatory ritual to ensure the continued fertility of these beasts. One recent archaeological theory, how-<lb/>
ever, explains them pragmatically, as instructional guides transmitted from one generation to the next. In this way, hunter-initiates might have been trained to track individual bison and other large beasts indi-<lb/>
vidually in times when animal populations waned and mass kills of entire herds were impossible.<ref target="#CH1-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref> The por-<lb/>
trayal of hoofprints and other informational clues of particular importance to the hunter, such as large ant-<lb/>

<p>Though we can never fully comprehend the mentality of the Paleolithic artists who created these paintings nor that of the hunters who derived meaning from them, we can surmise that whatever instructional purpose these images may have served, they were also allied with some kind of religious practice. The fact that they are within caves places them naturally in the rich realm of the human unconscious, with its well-es-<lb/>

Rather, we might think of it as animated line, a graphic expression of the life force inherent in nature. The way in which the figures are disposed to take advantage of certain plastic characteristics of walls of the cave is congruent with the notion of haptic, or tactile, rather than straightforward, optical perception, and the conception of space on the part of those who created these dynamic images was surely different from our sense of space as some-<lb/>

<p>The evolutionary development of agriculture and animal husbandly in the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, brought with it greater stability and confi-<lb/>
dence. Human beings formed more or less perma-<lb/>
nent settlements and imprinted the land by their occupancy. Boundary as a concept arrived when people began to circumscribe villages and subdi-<lb/>
vide land into fields. Megaliths, giant stones expelled from the maws of the retreating glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age, were upended, the world's first monuments (fig. 1.3).<ref target="#CH1-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> That these <hi rend="italic">menhirs</hi>, as the huge markers found chiefly in <name type="place">Brit-<lb/>

ment within agricultural communities brought a new range of fears. Now it was not enough to ensure that animal spirits were propitiated and the lives of the beasts perpetuated. The cooperation of the cos-<lb/>
mos itself was necessary if crops were not to fail and the now-cohesive and increasingly specialized social unit were to thrive. Humans were keenly aware of their dependence upon the sun and also upon the moon and stars. Diligent skywatchers, they associated the positions of various celestial bodies with recurring seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>The awe-inspiring megalithic forms of Stone-<lb/>

cession of construction campaigns between 2750 and 1500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> They outline a ritual center that may have functioned as a religious festival space where celebrations relating to its function as an astronom-<lb/>
ical observatory were held (figs. 1.4, 1.5). This impressive work of architecture, sited at the conflu-<lb/>
ence of several lines of hills, originated as an earth-<lb/>
work. The first builders of Stonehenge described a huge circle in the white chalky earth, which they then piled up in two banks broken only in one spot. They flanked this opening with two small upright stones. Beyond these, slightly off-axis with the break, they erected a 35-ton, roughly cylindrical, tapering megalith of sarsen, a gray sandstone from the nearby <name type="place">Marlborough Hills</name>. Called variously the <name type="place">Friar's Heel</name>, <name type="place">Hele Stone</name> (perhaps from the Anglo-<lb/>
Saxon word_<hi rend="italic">helan</hi>, meaning "to conceal"), Heel Stone, Sun Stone, Index Stone, and Petrie's Stone 96, this marker was ascertained by eighteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury scientists to be aligned with an imaginary axis drawn between the rising sun and the center point of the circle on the day of the summer solstice. At least one modern archaeologist has pointed out that in the case of the many photographs depicting this phenomenon, the photographer has stood a few paces away from the center of the circle because the rising solstice sun is not concealed by the megalith but appears a foot and a half to the left.<ref target="#CH1-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> This does not, however, negate an interpretation based upon archaeoastronomy, relating earthworks with the positions of heavenly bodies at certain important points in the calendrical cycle. The megalith does lie along an axis from the center of the circle to the horizon midway between the major northern moon-<lb/>
rise and the minor northern moonrise, and it may have once aided observers of these lunar events.</p>
<p>Stonehenge served as a ritual center over
<pb n="31"/>
<pb n="31" type="orig"/>
several centuries, and there was evidently enough social cohesion and sufficiently advanced technology for undertaking additional building programs. One generation of laborers constructed a 35-foot- (10.7-<lb/>
meter-) wide avenue, defined by chalk embankments like the original circle. It ran in a straight line along the axis of the megalithic outlier, bending somewhat as it approached the river <name type="place">Avon</name>. The Stonehenge builders next erected monoliths of bluestone weigh-<lb/>
ing up to 5 tons each in a double ring, open at the point of the axis. Although it has long been held that these were quarried from the distant <name type="place">Preseli Moun-<lb/>
tains</name> in <name type="place">Wales</name> and then transported some 300 miles (483 kilometers) by land, sea, and river to the site, an alternative, less heroic supposition holds that boulders plucked by the ice sheet that once moved ponderously across this part of the world carried enough Preseli bluestones as glacial erratics to fur-<lb/>

<p>In any case, a subsequent generation of builders put these bluestones aside in favor of much larger megaliths of <name type="place">Marlborough</name> sarsen quarried nearby, which they arranged as trilithons&#x2014;two upright "col-<lb/>

<p>World-famous as an enigmatic relic of the Stone Age and unique for <name type="place">Britain</name> in several respects, includ-<lb/>
ing its builders' use of lintels, Stonehenge is by no means an isolated example of Neolithic landscape architecture. There are many other stone circles in <name type="place">Britain</name> and <name type="place">Ireland</name> that also provide evidence of Neo-<lb/>
lithic astronomy, ritual need, and social congregation. Not surprisingly, over the centuries their mysterious presence in the countryside has engendered many leg-<lb/>
ends regarding Druidical rites, fairy dances, and witches' sabbaths. The phallic shape of certain stones has encouraged their status as objects of fertility wor-<lb/>
ship, and some New Age spiritualists today believe the stone circles to be cosmic power centers.</p>
<p>In addition to the megaliths arranged in circles, postholes indicating the arrangement of timbers as wooden rings have been found, and these, too, prob-<lb/>
ably functioned, like the stones of Stonehenge, as astronomical markers and the architectural definition of ceremonial centers, often with funerary associa-<lb/>
tions. Such a ring, or rather a series of concentric rings, is found a short distance to the northeast of Stonehenge, and archaeological evidence shows that it almost certainly served as both a place for astro-<lb/>

To the west of the most prominent earthwork, <name type="place">Monks Mound</name>, archaeologists in the <date when="1960">1960</date>s discovered four series of post- holes forming rings (fig. 1.6). They found fragments of red-<lb/>

<p>Earthen circles similar to the one encompass-<lb/>
ing the megalithic monument at Stonehenge are also inscribed on the <name type="place">Ohio</name> landscape. The Hopewell people, who occupied the <name type="place">Ohio Valley</name> in the period between 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, mounded long ridges of earth to outline large circles, squares, pen-<lb/>
tagons, and octagons. The most monumental com-<lb/>
plex of these geometrical mounds is found at <name type="place">Newark</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>, where more than 7 million cubic feet (198,100 cubic meters) of earth were carried in bas-<lb/>
kets to create two large circles, an octagon, and an almost square enclosure, all connected by broad "avenues" extending over an area of 4 square miles (10.36 square kilometers) (fig. 1.7). The avenues are defined by two parallel walls of earth similar to the linear earthen ridges that define the mysterious "roads" emanating from <name type="place">Chaco Canyon</name> in the American Southwest.</p>
<p>In recent years, the astronomer <name type="pname">Ray Hively</name> and philosopher <name type="pname">Robert Horn</name> have discovered a con-<lb/>
vincing rationale for the alignment of the roads and the large geometric forms at <name type="place">Newark</name> and the High Bank works near <name type="place">Chillicothe</name> by proving that the orientation of the earthworks in these places marks the maximum and minimum degrees north and south of true east of the moon's rising and setting on the horizon during an 18.6-year cycle. They also have shown how, in addition to giving physical expression to this impressive astronomical calcula-<lb/>
tion, the builders of the Hopewell earthworks sited them in relationship to one another in ways that demonstrate their mathematical sophistication. It is likely that the geometric enclosures defined by the mounds were built to serve as spaces in which danc-<lb/>
ing, market fairs, and other ritual and social activi-<lb/>
ties took place.</p>
<p>In addition to this kind of focused spatiality, which projected a relationship between earth and sky, there developed throughout the Neolithic Age a chthonic architecture of enclosure centered upon fertility, death, and the spirits of the underworld. Tombs&#x2014;architectural versions of the cave, such as dolmens, simple chambers formed by two or more upright megaliths with a capstone, and other kinds of more elaborate stone-roofed structures&#x2014;were built as sites for the care of the dead as reverence for ancestors increased. Rudimentary temples were also built as enclosures with shrines, altars for animal sacrifice, and spaces for public assembly.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Neolithic Urbanism</hi></hi></head>
<p>The evolution of Neolithic urban societies occurred during the millennium prior to the construction of Stonehenge. They flourished in the <name type="place">Nile Valley</name> in <name type="place">Egypt</name> and in the area known as the <name type="place">Fertile Crescent</name>, a semicircle of arable land extending from the south-<lb/>
east coast of the <name type="place">Mediterranean</name> around the <name type="place">Syrian Desert</name> north of the <name type="place">Arabian Peninsula</name> to the <name type="place">Tigris</name> and <name type="place">Euphrates</name> river plain in <name type="place">Mesopotamia</name>. There was as well a corresponding development in the <name type="place">Indus Valley</name>. The accretion of power within the hands of a ruling elite, who used religious authority as a means of organizing administrative systems, made possible the division of labor. This led to more efficient agricultural production, the crafting of use-specific items and wares, the beginning of trade, the building of monuments, and the birth of cities. Important technological improvements and the administrative capacity to undertake enormous pub-<lb/>
lic works provided an unprecedented degree of con-<lb/>
trol over nature, leading to the agricultural surpluses that made possible large urban settlements. Yet these prosperous societies adhered to religious cosmolo-<lb/>
gies that made them obedient to priestly rulers who understood the movements of celestial bodies and who performed propitiatory rites to ensure fertility of crops and people. These practices are reflected in the ways these two mighty civilizations designed upon the land.</p>

<p>In <name type="place">Mesopotamia</name>, between the <name type="place">Tigris</name> and the <name type="place">Euphra-<lb/>
tes Rivers</name>, urbanism of a lasting kind began between 3500 and 3000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Shortly thereafter, another urban culture evolved within the <name type="place">Nile Valley</name> of <name type="place">Egypt</name>. Administrative structures capable of plan-<lb/>
ning and controlling crops to sustain large popula-<lb/>
tions were essential to the development of cities in these two areas. In both lands, rulers shared power with a priestly elite. In addition to furnishing the ritual structure that sanctified life and brought reli-<lb/>
gious practice and protection to the city's inhabi-<lb/>
tants, priests administered a highly organized governing system. Government officials controlled grain storage and distribution, the division of lands, the construction of dikes, dams, and canals, the col-<lb/>
lection of taxes, and the fielding of armies and other means of organizing labor. They also defended the community and kept peace within an increasingly complicated economic and social sphere.</p>
<p>This methodical governance would have been impossible without the invention of writing and the development of a literate class. Literacy enabled communication and recordkeeping. Mathematical literacy enabled computation and measurement. The many portraits of scribes in Egyptian and Mesopo-<lb/>
tamian art attest to the important role of this official in society.</p>
<p>As the carrier of ideas and concepts, literacy had another important and far-reaching result beyond these necessary practical ones. The written word, whether pictographic or hieratic, is a symbol and, as such, is fundamental to the mental concep-<lb/>
tion of other symbolical constructs, so it is safe to say that, for both practical and ideological reasons, the ziggurat, the pyramid, the temple, and the obe-<lb/>
lisk could not have existed in a preliterate world. And it is, of course, through writing as well as through painting, that we today are vouchsafed a glimpse of the relationship between ancient people and nature and of their esteem, and often reverence, for certain plants and animals.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Ziggurats</hi></hi></head>
<p>The association of mountaintops with divinity reflects a universal quest for cosmological meaning. This notion is embodied in the artificial ziggurat "mountain," the symbolical juncture of earth and sky deities. For peoples of the ancient Near East the ziggurat served as an earthly counterpart to the pole star, an axis around which the heavens were believed to revolve. It also manifested a cosmology that pre-<lb/>
vailed throughout the Mesopotamian region under the Sumerian (c. 3500&#x2013;2030 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), Akkadian (c. 2340&#x2013;2180 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), and Babylonian (c. <date when="1750">1750</date> and intermittently to 528 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) cultures. This cosmol-<lb/>
ogy, which was first developed by the Sumerians, is later expressed in the Babylonian creation poem, the <hi rend="italic">Enuma Elish</hi>,_written sometime before the reign of <name type="pname">Hammurabi</name> (ruled c. <date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1750">1750</date> <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>). In this cos-<lb/>
mogonic account, the primal state of the universe consists of <name type="pname">Tiamat</name> and <name type="pname">Apsu</name>, two kinds of water, salt and fresh. Their commingling provides the matrix out of which the first places emerge, thus causing the primary scission that separates heaven from earth. This separation is enforced when <name type="pname">Marduk</name>, the Babylonian national god, does battle with <name type="pname">Tiamat</name>, utterly dominating and destroying her. From their struggle <name type="pname">Marduk</name> emerges as formgiver, architect, and master builder of the universe. He creates the line of horizon and asserts dominion over the fertile but formless primal matter represented by <name type="pname">Tiamat</name>. From <name type="pname">Tiamat</name>'s dismembered but endlessly procre-<lb/>
ative body, he fashions the arc of the sky, personified by <name type="pname">Anu</name>, lord of heaven and the father of gods. He also sets the firm subterranean foundation that upholds the earth, embodied as Ea, god of waters and the netherworld. In the middle zone between these he stations Enlil, god of air and heaven, who is also identified with the wind. With this <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> set in place, <name type="pname">Marduk</name> bestows directionality, driving through <name type="pname">Tiamat</name>'s ribs openings to the east and west and setting the zenith at the apex of her belly. <name type="pname">Mar-<lb/>
duk</name>, as architect-sculptor, then models the earth's topography, creating mountains and streams and making the great <name type="place">Tigris</name> and <name type="place">Euphrates</name> flow from <name type="pname">Tiamat</name>'s eyes. By rearing a stepped platform into the sky, Mesopotamian priests could bring the pre-<lb/>
siding deity of the heavens, Anu (An in the Sume-<lb/>
rian cosmos), into contact with Bel (Sumerian Enlil), the earth spirit sheltered within its sacred form, as well as with Ea (Enki in the pre-Babylonian mythology), the supernatural power in charge of the underworld and the subterranean waters that sprang forth, teeming with life, in the fecund marshes.</p>
<p>Mesopotamian religion was grounded in ani-<lb/>
mism, the belief that such elements as wind and water had conscious life and that spirit forces dwelt within trees as well as in birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals. Plants and beasts were therefore believed to have an existence independent of their physical representations. That the ziggurat expressed the human desire to forge a connection between the various spheres of a magic-charged universe is evi-<lb/>
dent from the names of some: Heaven and Storm,

<p>The building of ziggurats and their attendant temple structures was reverently undertaken by the early kings of <name type="pname">Sumer</name> as a means of preserving the often fragile harmony with nature upon which depended the continued life of the community and state. Even as they were built, however, their demise was often foreseen in dedication inscrip-<lb/>
tions referring to a time when they would fall into ruin. Constructed with a central core of trodden clay and mud brick, which was then clad with baked brick, their inward-sloping walls and stepped terraces were created of brick courses interspersed at staged intervals with damp courses of reeds and bitumen. In spite of these damp courses and the presence of weepholes, ziggurats remained permeable to water. In time, this caused the interior core of mud brick to expand, forcing the exterior walls outward until they cracked and broke apart.</p>
<p>The biblical image of the collapsed <name type="place">Tower of Babel</name> was probably based upon real examples of ruined ziggurats observed by captive Israelites. This image of cosmopolitan decadence has offered a compelling metaphor for allegorical storytellers and artists through the ages. Such mounds can still be seen today (fig. 1.8).</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Pyramids</hi></hi></head>
<p>The Egyptian pyramid had a purpose altogether different from that of the ziggurat, for the pyra-<lb/>
mid was both the tomb of the king and the means of his posthumous daily ascension and unification with Re, the Sun God.<ref target="#CH1-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref> The cult of Re furnished the pyramid with its essential meaning. To under-<lb/>
stand its underlying theology, one must attempt to see the annual inundation of the <name type="place">Nile</name> plain from the perspective of the early Egyptian. Each spring, as the flood waters rose and then began to subside, the mound of Elephantine&#x2014;the island below the First Cataract of the <name type="place">Nile</name>&#x2014;appeared to come miraculously alive with vegetation, birds, fish, reptiles, and insects. This primal scene was enacted elsewhere as other rocky and sandy mounds within the river received a rich mantle of silt and sprang suddenly into fecund life. To the early Egyptian, the mound itself seemed to be the autonomous progenitor of this miracle, and thus it became revered as the elemental life force. Irri-<lb/>
gation and the warming rays of the sun together were necessary to continue the earth's renewal and bring about growth. Thus, the creation mound was identified both with the phoenix, the mytho-<lb/>
logical bird of light that dispelled the darkness over the waters, and the god Atum, the Egyptian form of the <name type="pname">Demiurge</name>, <name type="pname">Plato</name>'s name for the force that fashions the material world.</p>
<p>The sun was believed to have emerged from the water to manifest itself first as the light of the sacred <hi rend="italic">ben-ben</hi>, a pyramidal stone symbolizing both the life force inherent in the mound and the petrifaction of the sun's rays. In this manner, the imagery of Atum was conflated with that of Re, the sun god, and the <hi rend="italic">ben-ben</hi> was expanded to monumental scale as the pyramid, the funerary home of Re's earthly representative, the all-pow-<lb/>
erful divine king, later called pharaoh. Thus did pyramids serve as supreme symbols of royal authority and power. When still covered with their
<pb n="36"/>
<pb n="36" type="orig"/>
gleaming casings of Tura limestone, their gold-capped tops sending forth rays like the sun itself, they broadcast to ancient Egyptians a magnificent promise of rebirth beyond the grave as well as annual renewal and earthly well-being through the rituals of divine kingship.</p>

<p>Grandeur on this scale was difficult to sustain, as is evident from the diminishing size of the Old Kingdom pyramids of the kings <name type="pname">Khufu</name>, <name type="pname">Khafre</name>, and <name type="pname">Menkaure</name> at <name type="place">Giza</name> (fig. 1.9).

<p>In <name type="place">India</name> and other lands where Hinduism is prac-<lb/>
ticed, one can still encounter cosmologically sacred sites and structures&#x2014;physical embodiments of places where gods are believed to dwell. Evolved from a very old, pre-Hindu tradition, Hindu cosmol-<lb/>
ogy associates caves and mountains as opposite poles of an <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> of sacred potency. In Hindu mythology <name type="place">Mount Meru</name> is regarded as the navel of the universe, the cosmological center of a concentric arrangement of the continents, oceans, and celestial bodies. Temple architecture is correspondingly cos-<lb/>
mological both in plan and elevation. Outwardly, the temple takes the shape of a mythological moun-<lb/>
tain, and temple worship is equated with a pilgrim-<lb/>
age to a mountain sanctuary (fig. 1.11). In elevation, the temple conforms to the cosmic <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> run-<lb/>
ning from the cave in the center of the earth to the celestial space above the mountain apex (fig. 1.10). The temple's dark interior sanctuary is a chthonic focal point, a simulation of the cavelike womb, source of life. It is there that the worshiper comes into the presence of the godhead. From this center, energy is believed to radiate upward along a cosmic axis through tiered vertical space composed of numerous concentric stories to a crowning circular finial that symbolizes the state of total enlighten-<lb/>
ment associated with spiritual perfection and the body's release from periodic reincarnation. This axis also symbolizes the pillar of heaven, identified as <name type="place">Meru</name>, and the trunk of an immortal tree whose wide-spreading branches support the universe. In plan, a temple outlines a mandala, the cosmically significant sacred geometric diagram that portrays the structure of the universe (fig. 1.12). The mandala plan of the temple is strictly oriented to the cardinal points of the compass, generally along an east-west axis, and astronomy and astrology play an important role in its siting and construction.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the third millennium <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> in the Sumerian kingdom of lower <name type="place">Mesopotamia</name>, and later, sometime in the early second millennium <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, to the north in <name type="place">Babylonia</name>, the antagonism between popula-<lb/>
tions of nomadic animal herders and grain-growing peoples forced the latter to dwell in cities, which they fortified with stout double walls. In <name type="place">Egypt</name>, on the other hand, it is uncertain to what extent large residential cities existed for any significant period of time. Each king would undertake vast building projects as a means of manifesting his divine kingship, and there were workers' and artisans' settlements adjacent to these. In addition, there were administrative centers with palace precincts and residential quarters for the members of the nobility who with scribes and other functionaries managed the government. The Egyptian temple complexes at <name type="place">Memphis</name>, <name type="place">Heliopolis</name>, and <name type="place">The-<lb/>
bes</name> served as festival centers for important rituals. Yet it is still not clear whether the peasants who tilled the crops that provided food for the general populace and wealth for the temple administrations lived in cities or in village settlements in the fields.</p>

<p>Upper-class residential districts had the same amenities, including gardens, as do affluent suburbs today. Because funerary art represents many of the pleasant accouterments of life, it is from the wall paintings and excavated artifacts of despoiled tombs that one gains evidence of Egyptian garden design and horticultural practices. In a painting from a Theban tomb consecrated during the reign of <name type="pname">Amenhotep III</name> (ruled 1390&#x2013;1352 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), a house sits within a garden surrounded by a wall (fig. 1.13). The garden, which is laid out according to an orthogonal grid plan, could be entered through two gates, one cut into the wall facing a tree-lined path beside a canal, and the other through a porter's lodge. Once inside, the visitor was surrounded by date palms and sycamore trees. A large vineyard, orchards, and four ponds filled with lotus blossoms and ducks and fringed with clumps of papy-<lb/>
rus formed part of the design. Two of the ponds have kiosks, or garden pavilions, beside them. These are set within a series of walled enclosures that divide the space into several garden "rooms" and segregate plan-<lb/>
tations of various tree species.</p>
<p>Floriculture was the source of a lively commerce. Flowers were fashioned into bouquets, garlands, and collars. At religious festivals and funerals, those attending brought floral arrangements as well as bun-<lb/>
dles and heaps of loose flowers. The dead were buried wearing intricately woven floral collars and shrouds decorated with garlands. <name type="pname">Ramesses III</name> helped make <name type="place">Thebes</name> a garden city by planting trees and papyrus plants. In an urban center, which he founded in the <name type="place">Nile</name> delta to the north, he is said to have created vine-<lb/>
yards, laid out walks shaded by fruit trees, and planted flowers from many countries.</p>
<p>Ancient Near Eastern cities were for the most part hierarchical arrangements of space expressing class dis-<lb/>
tinctions. Order, as reflected in geometric regularity, where it existed, was evidence of the authoritarian power of the ruler and the priesthood. This theocratic kingship defined ceremonial axes and controlled the distribution of lands, and there was segregation of specialized func-<lb/>
tions into defined districts. Cosmological considerations governed the organization of axes and the creation of temple precincts.</p>
<p>Sumerian cities took the shape of an organic hive of residential and artisan activity surrounding a religious and palace precinct. At <name type="pname">Sumer</name> and also at <name type="place">Akkad</name>, the city founded by <name type="pname">Sargon I</name> (ruled 2332&#x2013;2279 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) after the Semitic Akkadians conquered <name type="place">Meso-potamia</name> around 2340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, temples and palaces stood near the center of the city. In these cities and at Ur, sited at the juncture of a large canal and the <name type="place">Euphrates</name>, the principal temple was raised far above the ground atop a massive ziggurat, the pre-eminent image and cosmological symbol of the city (see fig. 1.8). The entire town rose above the surrounding plain on a base of debris from collapsed mud buildings that had accumulated over many generations. Massive gates punctuated the thick enclosing walls.</p>
<pb n="39"/>

<p>The Assyrian cities that subsequently rose in the area to the north of the Tigris<name type="place">-Euphrates</name> plain were also impressive in their monumentality. A cuneiform map of the city of <name type="place">Nippur</name> on the <name type="place">Euphra-<lb/>
tes</name> in the center of <name type="place">Babylonia</name>, dated about 1500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, shows a city intersected by a canal, with moat- and river-bordered walls pierced by seven gates (fig. 1.14). No streets are shown, but its prin-<lb/>
cipal temples are depicted, together with a large park located in an acute angle formed by the walls at the southern end of the city. Parks, the pride of Sume-<lb/>
rian and Babylonian kings, were the prototypes of the Persian <hi rend="italic">pairidaeza</hi>, the walled hunting park. The <hi rend="italic">Epic of Gilgamesh</hi> has a description of what may have been a hunting park in the southern Babylonian city of <name type="place">Erech</name> (called <name type="place">Uruk</name> during Akkadian times). Like their Persian successors, the ancient Near East-<lb/>
ern monarchs brought to their parks exotic trees, which they acquired from other lands by trade or conquest. Especially prized were the myrrh trees of the <name type="place">Hittites</name> from the region that is <name type="place">Syria</name> today. It was the idealized landscape of that hilly country that King <name type="pname">Sargon II</name> (ruled 721&#x2013;705 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) of ancient Assyria (a culture dominant in the region from about 1000 to 612 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) and other rulers wished to recall with the simile "like the Amanus Mountains," which is frequently found in their boastful inscriptions proclaiming their park-building schemes.</p>
<p>In the exceedingly hot climate, the garden of shade trees was a much-appreciated luxury. From bas-reliefs and archaeological remains, it is evident that the Babylonians planted trees in rows and built intricate irrigation channels to water them. They created rush-bordered ponds to shelter wildlife and built pleasure houses on hills or terraces overlooking this panorama of garden scenery. A seventh-century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Assyrian relief from Nineveh depicts a royal garden in which <name type="pname">Assurbanipal</name> and his queen are enjoying a feast beneath an arbor of grapes, cele-<lb/>
brating his victory over the <name type="pname">Elamite</name> king whose severed head is hanging from a tree branch (fig. 1.15). The regularly planted trees in this garden include the date palm, which was also grown along canal banks. Dates were cultivated in orchards as well, along with various fruit trees&#x2014;apples, plums, peaches, cherries, figs, and pomegranates.</p>

<p>Later generations praised the fabled Hanging Gardens of <name type="place">Babylon</name> as one of the wonders of the ancient world, and the search for them has occa-<lb/>

According to one of five accounts by ancient writers, they were built by <name type="pname">King Nebuchadnezzar II</name> (ruled 604&#x2013;562 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) for his queen, who was homesick for the mountain mead-<lb/>
ows of her native Media. Other descriptions speak of a series of descending terraces built on top of vaulted galleries. The suggestion has been dis-<lb/>
counted that trees and other vegetation growing in soil beds or tree pits upon the terraces of the ziggurat at <name type="place">Babylon</name> could be what were referred to as the Hanging Gardens because of the insurmountable difficulty of bringing sufficient water in irrigation channels from the <name type="place">Euphrates River</name> to this monu-<lb/>
<pb n="40"/>
<pb n="40" type="orig"/>
ment. Some archaeologists now surmise that raised gardens may have occupied superimposed terraces on what they call the Western Outwork structure between <name type="pname">Nebuchadnezzar</name>'s palace and the <name type="place">Euphrates</name>. Although their claim is not definitive, it is supported by the presence in this location of the kind of deep drains that would have been necessary for extensive irrigation.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Processional Axes</hi></hi></head>
<p>The processional axis, or ceremonial way, developed in conjunction with religious rituals in which priest and populace assembled in precincts before ziggu-<lb/>
rats, pyramids, and temples. A program of ritualistic approach and movement through a series of hieratic spaces necessitated axial arrangements, offering opportunities for kinetic drama. Thus we find the <name type="place">Giza</name> pyramids of the Old Kingdom (2686&#x2013;2181 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) set in the desert verge and linked to riverside temples by long, sloping causeways&#x2014;the pyramid and the mortuary temple at its base being the archi-<lb/>
tectural climax of an axial route that began at a val-<lb/>
ley temple near the banks of the <name type="place">Nile</name>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Middle Kingdom (2055&#x2013;1650 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), across the <name type="place">Nile</name> from a temple complex at <name type="place">Karnak</name> (near modern-day <name type="place">Luxor</name>) and on axis with it, <name type="pname">Mentuhotep II</name> (ruled 2009&#x2013;1997 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) built into the monumental rock face of the cliff a large temple-tomb (fig. 1.16). This funerary group-<lb/>
ing had a large forecourt planted with tamarisks and sycamore fig trees. A high, square colonnaded plat-<lb/>
form supported a mortuary temple built in the form of a vestigial pyramid. Behind the mortuary temple, lodged in the cliff itself, stood another narrower court and hypostyle hall. This complex furnished a vocab-<lb/>
ulary of forms for the adjacent temple built five hun-<lb/>
dred years later by a remarkable monarch of the New Kingdom, <name type="pname">Queen Hatshepsut</name>, who reigned from about 1478 to 1458 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi></p>
<p>At this point in her long history, <name type="place">Egypt</name> was experiencing a period of wealth and could, without any sacrifice of agricultural labor, build monumental works of architecture and landscape design by using its peacetime anny. Like <name type="pname">Mentuhotep II</name>, <name type="pname">Hatshepsut</name> had her sepulcher carved within the cliff face at <name type="pname">Deir el-Bahri</name>. It formed the terminus of a grand axis that began at the temple complex of Karnak on the oppo-<lb/>
site bank of the <name type="place">Nile</name>, continuing from a riverside temple on the west bank along an avenue of sphinxes, whence it ascended, first one, and then a second mas-<lb/>
sive ramp, each flanked by long colonnades. This axis culminated at last in the great hall of <name type="pname">Hatshepsut</name>'s temple. In the superb wedding of natural and archi-<lb/>
tectural forms, the columns of the colonnade echoing
<pb n="41"/>
<pb n="41" type="orig"/>
the geological verticals behind them, <name type="pname">Hatshepsut</name>'s architect <name type="pname">Senenmut</name> left his mark for posterity.</p>
<p>On the walls of the colonnade of the second of two large terraces, temple sculptors left a record of international trade as well as a fascinating footnote to the history of horticulture. Here reliefs depict an expe-<lb/>
dition to Punt, present-day <name type="place">Somalia</name>, to procure the precious myrrh trees <name type="pname">Queen Hatshepsut</name> wished to plant beside her temple. The resin of this tree was dedicated in measured heaps to the sun god Amon. Scenes of this early botanical conquest show how roots were balled and held in place in baskets sus-<lb/>
pended by ropes tied to poles carried by groups of four or six men, depending upon the size of the tree (fig. 1.18).</p>
<p>Like the Egyptians, the Babylonians honored their deity and manifested their power and prosperity in axial arrangements of landscape space. <name type="pname">Nebuchad-<lb/>
nezzar II</name>, who is remembered as the ruler who cap-<lb/>
tured and destroyed <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> and led the Jews into captivity, aggrandized <name type="place">Babylon</name> through a lavish rebuilding program. His works included, in addition to the Hanging Gardens, the magnificent <name type="place">Ishtar Gate</name> and a great processional way leading to the Temple of <name type="pname">Marduk</name>, which he had plated with gold.</p>

<p>During the Middle Kingdom, the life-giving, sun-<lb/>

<p>Throughout the period of the New Kingdom (1550&#x2013;1069 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), monumental temples multiplied within the <name type="place">Nile Valley</name>.

<p>The quarrying, erection, subsequent transpor-<lb/>
tation, and re-erection of obelisks in distant parts of the world provides a remarkable footnote in the history of world monuments and city planning. The first obelisks to be transported from <name type="place">Egypt</name> were a pair appropriated in 671 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> as trophies of war by <name type="pname">Assurbanipal I</name>, the Assyrian conqueror of <name type="place">The-<lb/>
bes</name>. Subsequently, Roman emperors garnered them in their Egyptian campaigns. Fifteen hundred years later, the papal planners of <name type="place">Baroque Rome</name> reposi-<lb/>
tioned them as focal points in the <hi rend="italic">piazze</hi> of their rebuilt city.</p>
<p>Borrowing from this example, other countries transported Egyptian obelisks at great expense to dis-<lb/>
tant cities where they became prestigious ornaments within the urban landscape, as the following bit of history makes clear. To celebrate one of the jubilees of his prosperous reign, <name type="pname">Tuthmose III</name> (ruled 1479&#x2014; 1425 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) sent a crew of stonecutters to the quarries of <name type="pname">Aswan</name> for the purpose of extracting twin obelisks from the granite there. Workers chiseled and exca-<lb/>
vated the stone, carving the obelisks on the site. Other workers then dragged the obelisks by sledge to the river and floated them at flood time by barge to <name type="place">Heliopolis</name> where they were placed in front of the Tem-<lb/>
ple of the Sun. Nine hundred years later, in 525 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, the Persians burned and toppled the obelisks during their conquest of <name type="place">Egypt</name>. After another five hundred years, when <name type="place">Egypt</name> had declined to the status of a prov-<lb/>
ince of the Roman Empire, <name type="pname">Augustus Caesar</name> installed them in front of the <name type="pname">Caesarium</name> at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>. In the nineteenth century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, a millennium and a half after <name type="place">Rome</name> had fallen, the obelisks made their respective journeys as souvenirs of international diplomacy to the <name type="place">Thames</name> embankment in <name type="place">London</name> and <name type="place">New York City's Central Park</name> (fig. 1.20).</p>
<p>These recycled obelisks illustrate how one civi-<lb/>
lization manifests its wealth and power by borrowing the forms (and in this case, actual objects) of another. For <name type="pname">Assurbanipal I</name>, the Theban obelisks symbolized the subjugation of a rival state. For <name type="pname">Augustus Caesar</name>, the obelisks of <name type="pname">Tuthmose III</name> were ready-made emblems of imperial glory. For nineteenth-century Parisians, the obelisk of <name type="pname">Ramesses II</name> served the same purpose the several obelisks brought to ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> had for <name type="pname">Pope
<pb n="43"/>
<pb n="43" type="orig"/>
Sixtus V</name> and his successors, ennobling the urban land-<lb/>
scape and fixing space within an axial plan. For nine-<lb/>
teenth-century Londoners, the second recycling of one of <name type="pname">Tuthmose III</name>'s obelisks was, as it had been for <name type="pname">Augustus Caesar</name>, a symbol of imperial might. For New Yorkers, its twin was a means of ornamenting a pictur-<lb/>
esque landscape while proclaiming cosmopolitan civic status. Thus was a religious symbol of the sun, sacred to the Egyptians, turned into exotic treasure and appro-<lb/>
priated as civic embellishment, while at the same time becoming a popular form for funerary monuments and architecture as discussed in Chapter Nine (see figs. 9.27, 9.28). We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the obelisk in its original location was part of a complex, cosmologically focused landscape design. It is important to remember that, whether in the Old World or the New, the natural and cultural landscapes that gave sacred meaning to human life reflected the desire for predictable, life-sustaining order in the uni-<lb/>
verse. This meant agricultural prosperity, dominance of elites over their subjects, and victory over enemies in war. The proper alignment with cosmic forces was therefore considered vital, and both practical and reli-<lb/>
gious objectives furnished motives for the design of landscape space.</p>

<p>Unlike the topography of <name type="place">Egypt</name>, which in ancient times consisted of a single ribbon supportive of human habitation in the cliff-walled, desert-bordered <name type="place">Nile Valley</name>, that of <name type="place">Greece</name> is made up of many broad, cradling, spring-fed valleys separated by mountains of impressive though not awesome size. The geologic forces that created the mountains are expressed in their southeastward orientation and their continuation as the <name type="place">Cyclades</name>, <name type="place">Rhodes</name>, and other islands&#x2014;the higher elevations of a drowned mountain system. This orientation and the existence of such an array of island stepping-stones along the coast of <name type="place">Asia Minor</name> gave the peoples who populated the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, and <name type="place">Crete</name> opportunities for inter-<lb/>
change with the highly developed cultures to the east and south of the Aegean archipelago. At the same time, the sea preserved a strong degree of isolation, which allowed them to develop indigenous patterns of culture and religion.</p>
<p>As we have seen, <name type="place">Egypt</name>'s linear, riverine geog-<lb/>
raphy, because of its connectedness and the need for large-scale management of irrigation, encouraged the development of unified theocratic kingship. The frag-<lb/>
mentation of the Greek landscape and the dependence of Greek settlements upon water from underground springs militated against autocracy and massive bureaucratic administration. Rather, it fostered the creation of several small tribal civilizations among whom hegemony was based upon successful warfare and maritime trade. A pastoral people who measured wealth in terms of livestock, the early Greeks lived in scattered settlements and did not need the mass orga-<lb/>
nization of society necessary for the large-scale culti-<lb/>
vation of grain.</p>
<p>In <name type="place">Egypt</name>, the <name type="place">Nile</name> landscape was a single mighty engine of fertility and life. Divinity resided at the des-<lb/>
ert verge in monumental pyramids and cliff-hewn temples. In <name type="place">Greece</name>, the topographically diverse and dramatically beautiful landscape itself became invested with religious meaning. For ancient inhabi-<lb/>
tants it was the home of powerful goddesses and gods. Foremost among these deities in the remote centuries of prehistory was the Great Goddess, called <name type="pname">Potnia</name> in the Minoan culture of <name type="place">Crete</name>.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="place">Crete</name></hi></hi></head>
<p>The importance of the earth goddess and animal spirit is apparent in sculpture and painting from the Minoan civilization that existed on the island of <name type="place">Crete</name> from about 3000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> until 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi><ref target="#CH1-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref> This civilization was contemporaneous with that of <name type="place">Egypt</name> and the Hit-<lb/>

Although there is evidence of contact with these well-developed cultures, in its nonmilitaristic social values and goddess-worshipping religion, as well as in the sophisticated yet youthful ebullience manifested in its art, it demonstrates an independent development and autonomous nature.</p>
<p>After a millennium of evolution, Minoan civili-<lb/>
zation reached its zenith around 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and main-<lb/>
tained this cultural high-water mark, in spite of massive destruction from earthquakes and fires about 1700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Subsequently, another, more horrendous episode of geophysical disturbance charted this cul-<lb/>

The cave plays a part in the Greek myth in which Gaia (Earth) and Uranos (Sky) gave birth to <name type="pname">Kronos</name> and <name type="pname">Rhea</name>, the parents of <name type="pname">Zeus</name>. Jealous to pre-<lb/>

That there was a shrine at this site in Minoan times, is attested by the many artifacts found there, including shields, spears, gold and ivory votive objects, figurines, and clay tablets, as well as deposits of ash and the bones of sacrificed animals.</hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>There is now considerable archaeological evi-<lb/>
dence showing that Minoans made ritual visits to hill-<lb/>
top sanctuaries and sacred caves. In addition to revering the earth goddess, they probably sought to propitiate the weather gods on high, a religious impulse not unlike that of the Mesopotamians and the pre-Co-<lb/>
lumbian Americans. Public festivals brought congre-<lb/>
gations of worshipers to these dramatically situated, bare, and windswept peaks, where they found stone-<lb/>
paved terraces with altars placed before a <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi>, or holy precinct, outlined by walls and balustrades crowned with sacral horns. Local pastoralists fre-<lb/>
quented these places, seeking protection for their cattle through votive offerings and propitiatory rites. The shrines themselves were well furnished with variously shaped altars, cult images, sacrificial tables, ladles, lamps, and libation vessels. Male and female clay fig-<lb/>
urines were left behind as surrogates for the worship-<lb/>
ers, symbolizing their continuing devotional presence in the holy spot.</p>
<p>The hilly Cretan limestone terrain, a landscape type known to geologists as a karst formation and the source of the underground springs that sustained Minoan and later Greek communities, is riddled with some two thousand caves. A small number, perhaps thirty-five or so, had sacred status, probably because of their association with burial; among these an esti-<lb/>
mated sixteen were used for cult practices (fig. 1.21). Votive gold double-axes and figurines of bronze have been found in sacred caves along with evidence of animal sacrifice and offerings of grain and other pro-<lb/>
duce. There is evidence, too, of ritual dancing and feasting outside the caves. Funeral pyres burned at cave entrances before the performance of the chthonic rites within.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the peak and cave sanctuaries, walled enclosures guarded a sacred tree or perhaps marked the site of an epiphany. Some archaeologists surmise that worshipers tore branches or boughs from enshrined sacred trees and venerated them on altars or planted them in sockets between sacral horns. Scenes depicted on seals and other artifacts offer evi-<lb/>
dence of ecstatic dancing by priestesses in these loca-<lb/>
tions.</p>
<p>Symbols of the Great Goddess, <name type="pname">Potnia</name>, were the double-axe, the stone pillar, and the snake. Perhaps it is she who is depicted as a bell-skirted, bare-breasted, snake-wielding figure (fig. 1.22); in scenes on seals and wall paintings she is frequently symbolized by a pillar guarded by rampant lions, a form that clearly relates to that of the famous Lioness Gate, the princi-<lb/>
pal entrance in the wall of the city-state of Mycenae on the Peloponnese (see fig. 1.25).</p>
<p>There were, in addition, other goddesses and gods. Britomartis, an early version of Artemis, the chaste mistress of the hunt and protector of animals, was worshiped in the mountain sanctuaries. Eleuthia, the Cave Goddess, protected women in childbirth; her special sanctuary was the Cave of Eileithyia at <name type="place">Amnisos</name>. The Snake Goddess and the Dove Goddess were also part of the Minoan pantheon, along with the
<pb n="45"/>
<pb n="45" type="orig"/>
Sea Goddess. Often, boundaries between these dei-<lb/>
ties were blurred as they assumed one another's attri-<lb/>
butes. The most powerful and feared god for the Minoans was Potidas, or Poteidan, the sea god who prefigured the <name type="place">Greek Poseidon</name>. His subterranean aspect was that of earth-shaker, lord of seismic trem-<lb/>
ors and tidal waves; his terrestrial form was that of a bull; and his celestial manifestation was as the sun and moon.</p>
<p>The civilization that emerged on <name type="place">Crete</name> was suf-<lb/>
ficiently at peace and advanced enough in shipbuild-<lb/>
ing, maritime skills, and trade to exert commercial supremacy and nonmilitary dominance. Unlike the later fiercely warring city-states of the Greek main-<lb/>
land, which were heavily fortified with walls, <name type="place">Knos-<lb/>
sos</name> and the other cities and towns of <name type="place">Crete</name> were without walls. The Labyrinth, or ceremonial center at <name type="place">Knossos</name>, was the most important reli-gious complex on <name type="place">Crete</name>, was a place of pilgrimage attracting wor-<lb/>
shipers from other parts of the island, and perhaps from other islands as well (fig. 1.23).</p>
<p>Minoans, like Greeks later, possessed a remark-<lb/>
able instinct for siting their religious centers and communities in relationship to natural topography. According to the controversial but here plausible interpretation of the architectural historian <name type="pname">Vincent Scully</name>, the builders of <name type="place">Knossos</name> and <name type="place">Phaistos</name> placed their centers within an enclosed valley, a "natural megaron," like a Minoan-palace great hall with its central hearth and columned porch, along a north-<lb/>
south axis facing a gently mounded conical hill framed by the distant "horns" of a double-peaked or cleft mountain. These natural forms define landscape space and focus it. Further serving ritual needs and their symbolical expression were the labyrinthine passage, the long rectangular court, the columned pavilion, and the cavelike pillared hall. At <name type="place">Knossos</name>, therefore, as one stands at the south propylaia, or gateway, one is facing a breast-shaped mound beyond which looms the cleft summit of <name type="place">Mount Juktas</name>, site of a peak sanctuary and cave shrine where cult rituals were held. Similarly, at <name type="place">Phaistos</name>, the central court is aligned along a north-south axis with twin-peaked <name type="place">Mount Ida</name>, site of the cave sanctuary sacred to <name type="pname">Zeus</name> (fig. 1.24). Like the Puebloan plazas of the American Southwest, this central court with its enclosing archi-<lb/>
tecture replicates at human scale the natural "mega-<lb/>
ron" that appears to contain it. Its alignment with a sacred form in nature, which also corresponds fairly closely to one of the cardinal directions, suggests that, like many Native American peoples, Cretan builders sited according to a combination of topo-<lb/>
graphical foci and cosmological references.</p>
<p>Their axes were not inscribed <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>_ nature, but existed rather as <hi rend="italic">orientation</hi> lines connecting ritual centers with shrines <hi rend="italic">in</hi> nature. Thus, unlike the cere-<lb/>
monial axes the Egyptians and some Native Ameri-<lb/>
cans built for religious processionals, the axes of <name type="place">Greece</name> were invisible lines. On <name type="place">Crete</name>, these axes presumably tied the religious practices involving a Snake Goddess and her representatives in the sanc-<lb/>
tuaries at <name type="place">Knossos</name>, <name type="place">Phaistos</name>, and other Minoan set-<lb/>
tlements with the cultic practices of the mountain caves. The sacral horns surrounding the mountain altars were dramatically evoked by the dancers' dar-<lb/>
ing somersaults through the horns of a living bull in a ritual ceremony that took place within the ceremo-<lb/>
nial court.</p>

<p>The intimate connection with local landscape and the desire to invest landscapes with religious

<p>The Bronze Age culture with which archaeologists have sought to identify the epic heroes of <name type="pname">Homer</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is that of the Mycenaean Greeks, whose civili-<lb/>
zation arose on the mainland between 1550 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and 1200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> There, warrior chieftains, the descen-<lb/>
dants of Indo-European invaders from the <name type="place">Balkans</name> or southern <name type="place">Russia</name>, ruled with might from fortress strongholds such as <name type="place">Pylos</name>, <name type="place">Orchomenos</name>, <name type="place">Mycenae</name>, <name type="place">Tiryns</name>, and <name type="place">Athens</name>. Their trade-based culture was rich enough to support palatial architecture, fine craftsmanship, luxurious furnishings, and lavish burial sites. Contact with <name type="place">East Asia</name> provided new standards of monumental architecture as well as dec-<lb/>
orative motifs. At the same time, their culture was influenced by that of <name type="place">Crete</name>, and they freely borrowed many Minoan forms and practices.</p>

</figure>
<p>The same chthonic rites and worship of the earth goddess as occurred on <name type="place">Crete</name> were practiced at Mycenaean sites. Apparent, however, in its war-<lb/>
rior culture was an incipient challenge to the earth goddess's supremacy, as Bronze Age men made mil-<lb/>
itary strength and protection of the clan through vic-<lb/>
tory on the battlefield a recognizable benefit on a par with fertility and the protection of the crops. This is evident in a more defensively strategic occupancy of the land. Because of the existence of springs in limestone ridges and the extensive presence of such karstic formations in <name type="place">Greece</name>, the Mycenaeans were able to site their cities on difficult-to-scale high points with long views of the surrounding valleys, plains, and sea. The Athenian Acropolis, which was occupied in Mycenaean times, was furnished with many such springs. Mycenae itself was situated on a hill above the plain of Argos. The population spread out upon the slopes below in convenient proximity to the fissures in the slope where springs were found, but close to the heavily fortified acrop-<lb/>
olis where they could seek safety from invaders. The approach to this stronghold was from the southwest along a path leading to the Lioness Gate within its cyclopean masonry walls (figs. 1.25; cf. 1.26).</p>
<p>In the turbulent period between 1200 and 1150 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, Mycenaean civilization was put to rout by invaders. Although they did not succeed in breaching the massive walls of the citadel, the Dorian newcom-<lb/>
ers from the north managed to topple the authority of the warrior kings there and in the other Myce-<lb/>
naean cities as they infiltrated the countryside, add-<lb/>
ing new traditions to the Helladic cultural base. Trading wealth vanished as did kingship, monumen-<lb/>
tal architecture, and fine craftsmanship in gold and bronze. Mycenaean citadels became shells wherein a remnant population lived amid the ruins of van-<lb/>
ished glory.</p>
<p>Geographical fragmentation abetted the gen-<lb/>
eral impoverishment in bringing about increased political fragmentation. Authoritarian-style rulership disappeared as society broke apart into tribal units. Common interests caused a collection of <hi rend="italic">phylai</hi>, or tribes, to fuse as a <hi rend="italic">demos</hi>. The members of a <hi rend="italic">demos</hi> gradually formed a <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, a communal center for refuge and religious practice. During the four centu-<lb/>
ries of gestation and social transformation that con-<lb/>
stituted the so-called Dark Age in <name type="place">Greece</name>, the <hi rend="italic">agora</hi>, a public space for assembly and debate, and the <hi rend="italic">boule</hi>, a council of nobles, became the seedbed of a-<lb/>
 radically new concept of governance. In this matrix, people cultivated a new respect for the individual. These were the forces at work as <name type="place">Greece</name>, undis-<lb/>
turbed by fresh invasions from the north or a resur-<lb/>
gence of authoritarian influence from the east, moved toward the eighth-century social develop-<lb/>
ment that created new institutions capable of redi-<lb/>
recting human destiny, the landscape expressions of which we shall examine in Chapter Two.</p>

<p>In looking at the landscapes of pre-Columbian archaeology and the remnant traditions of agricultural and pastoral peoples throughout the Americas, we can find enough parallels among disparate world cultures to support the notion of the universality of certain myths and religious practices. Such trans-<lb/>
cultural beliefs include the divinity ascribed to the sun, the importance of real and artificial mountains as sky platforms to bring a people into closer contact with their gods, particularly those associated with rain and fertility; the cave as the womb of the Earth Mother and a shrine in nature; the importance of both votive and sacrificial offerings; the portrayal of gods and spirits in animal form; the sense of human sub-<lb/>
servience to cosmological power, and the need&#x2014;sat-<lb/>
isfied through drumbeat, communal chant, and dance in designated sacred spaces&#x2014;to communicate with that power.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Cultural Parallels and Universal Patterns</hi></hi></head>
<p>The reverence for mountains and lakes, the belief that there is a numinous energy and life force animating stones and trees as well as living creatures is called <hi rend="italic">teotl</hi> in the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs, <hi rend="italic">huaca</hi> in the Andean tongue of Quechua, or <hi rend="italic">po-wa-ha</hi> in Tewa, the speech of <name type="pname">Santa Clara Pueblo</name> and other pueblos near the <name type="place">Rio Grande</name> in <name type="place">New Mexico</name>. To ensure the flow of this positive energy through their settlements, the precolonial builders in the Americas did not lay out their towns haphazardly. The cardinal points of the compass figure in many creation stories.<ref target="#CH1-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> <name type="place">Pueblo</name> villages, for instance, are oriented with respect to four sacred mountains and, at closer range, four mesas and four village shrines. These have legendary associa-<lb/>
tions with the explo-ratory paths to the north and south, east and west, taken by four pairs of mytho-<lb/>
logical twins as they emerged from a primal subter-<lb/>
ranean lake when Earth was still in formation.</p>
<p>Centeredness within this natural frame is important. The <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi>, or small hole in the middle of the Puebloan plaza, is an <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> uniting the upper world with the lower, the place whence life emerged and to which it returns. The circular <hi rend="italic">kiva</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">sipapu</hi>, another small hole like the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi> of the plaza, reinforced the all-pervading theme of cosmic axiality. According to Puebloan belief, a sky-basket, identified with the male principle, over-<lb/>
arches the bowl-earth, associated with the female. Within the earth part of this duality there are four concurrent planes of existence. Puebloan people emerged onto the fourth plane, the world of life and light, at the north opening of the Earth Mother.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, lake bottoms and natural caves are associated with myths of human emergence into this world. For millennia, Native Americans in many localities have made pilgrimages to cave-shrines in their sacred mountains as well as to spirit-inhabited mountain lakes. Because the great Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuac&#x00E1;n was built sometime between 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> and 225 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> above a natural cave probably associated with an origin myth, it is now thought that the city itself was sited with regard to this important natural symbol as well as in relation to <name type="pname">Cerro Gordo</name>, the mountain to the north, the profile of which is echoed by the axially aligned Pyramid of the Moon (fig. 1.27).</p>

<p>Mimetic architecture&#x2014;structures whose shapes imitate natural land forms&#x2014;is apparent in the diverse cultures of the Americas. Although less predeter-<lb/>

mined in plan and form than Teotihuac&#x00E1;n, <name type="pname">Taos Pueblo</name>, which is still occupied, bears a mimetic rela-<lb/>
tionship to Taos Mountain like that of the Pyramid of the Moon to <name type="pname">Cerro Gordo</name> (fig. 1.28). But in nei-<lb/>
ther case does the built environment dominate the natural one. The imitative forms are subservient to the natural ones. The former is the locus of human life and ritual ceremony; the latter is the residence of divinity.</p>
<p>Many of the great civilizations of the Americas vanished for reasons that can only be guessed. With-<lb/>
out a literature such as the Homeric epics or the more factually based stories of <name type="pname">Herodotus</name> and other histo-<lb/>
rians, the Aztecs were even more mystified than we about the fate of their predecessors in the Valley of <name type="place">Mexico</name>, the builders of Teotihuac&#x00E1;n. Although they set down their own oral traditions in hieroglyphic accounts, few survived the Spanish Conquest. Archaeology, too, was thwarted as the market value placed upon pre-Columbian artifacts made ancient centers vulnerable to the depredations of looters. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made by recent archaeology in decoding hieroglyphic sym-<lb/>
bols carved in stone and also in the field known as archaeoastronomy, the science that attempts to explain landscape constructions in cosmological terms. Archaeologists and archaeoastronomists have come to realize that by studying the siting of certain monuments and structures in relationship to the posi-<lb/>
tion of the stars, the course of the moon, or the posi-<lb/>
tion of the sun at the time of the spring and fall equinoxes, native peoples in the Americas were practicing what surely must have been landscape design in the broadest possible sense&#x2014;what we might call cosmological landscape architecture.</p>

<p>Pre-Columbian architecture is essentially an archi-<lb/>
tecture of mass and communal open space. Its con-<lb/>
struction was an administrative and technical feat of considerable magnitude. The scale of earth-moving operations undertaken by the people who built the first earthworks is indeed awe-inspiring, especially when one remembers that there existed no mecha-<lb/>
nized equipment such as that employed by the cre-<lb/>
ators of the modern earthworks discussed in Chapter Twelve, nor did these builders use wheeled vehicles. Like the pyramidal masonry "skyscrapers" of the Maya in <name type="place">Mexico</name> and <name type="place">Central America</name> (250 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>&#x2013;900 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>), the immense earthworks at Poverty Point, <name type="place">Lou-<lb/>
isiana</name> (1800 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>&#x2013;500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), the <name type="place">Hopewell Mounds</name> in <name type="place">Ohio</name> (100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>&#x2013;400 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>), and the mon-<lb/>
umental mounds of the Mississippian culture at <name type="place">Cahokia</name> near present-day <name type="pname">St. Louis</name> (800&#x2013;1350 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) are meant to be ascended, descended, or walked around (fig. 1.29). Unlike Western architecture since Roman times, these structures do not provide widely vaulted, domed, volumetric interior space. As opposed to basilicas and cathedrals, they are not architectural shells in which to move about freely. Because this is true, landscape space&#x2014;the space defined by both the architecture and the natural forms of the site&#x2014;is fundamental in both a utilitar-<lb/>
ian and a religious sense.</p>
<pb n="49"/>
<pb n="49" type="orig"/>
<p>The earliest evidence in the Americas of a large-<lb/>
scale, well-planned, collaboratively constructed land-<lb/>
scape space occurs in northeast <name type="place">Louisiana</name> where approximately five thousand years ago several series of large earthen mounds were built. At <name type="pname">Watson Brake</name>, the builders of eleven of these early mounds linked them by earthen ridges to form an oval-shaped enclo-<lb/>
sure (fig. 1.30). Their purpose was probably to accom-<lb/>
modate some funerary or other ceremonial practice. The persistence of this central space&#x2014;or plaza, if we adopt the Spanish term&#x2014;as a landscape form is evi-<lb/>
denced, as we have seen, in the extant pueblos of northern <name type="place">New Mexico</name> and <name type="place">Arizona</name>, which have occu-<lb/>
pied their present locations since around 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> The spectacular and well-preserved ruins within the shel-<lb/>
tering cliff faces of Mesa Verde in the San Juan Basin of southern <name type="place">Colorado</name> and <name type="place">Canyon de Chelly</name> in north-<lb/>
eastern <name type="place">Arizona</name>, which was occupied as early as the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> by people known as Basket Maker and then between 1100 and 1300 by the ancestral Puebloan people referred to as Anasazi, testify to the harmony between architecture and nature achieved by Native American builders. Even in these creviced locations they managed to fit miniature plazas with <hi rend="italic">kivas:</hi> level, open ledges that served both sacred and quotidian functions (fig. 1.31). Thus, whether the Ciu-<lb/>
dadela at Teotihuac&#x00E1;n, a 38-acre sunken plaza with the huge Temple of the Feathered Serpent at one end, a tiny platform in the wall of a <name type="place">Pueblo</name>-occupied cliff, or a half acre of packed earth forming the <hi rend="italic">bupingeh</hi> (middle-heart place) of contemporary Tewa people, plazas were and remain ceremonially important spaces, places of dance and priestly spectacle, includ-<lb/>

<p>In the Southwest, where the conditions for successful agriculture were especially demanding, native societ-<lb/>
ies were more egalitarian and less hierarchical than those of the great Mississippian, Mesoamerican, and Aztec builders who erected the massive pyramids that arouse our awe today. The peoples of the Southwest fit these structures into their spectacular, dry environ-<lb/>
ment with great ingenuity. In their landscape-con-<lb/>
forming works, economy and beauty go hand in hand. The cavelike <hi rend="italic">kiva</hi>, with its fire pit and <hi rend="italic">sipapu</hi>&#x2014;or emergence hole&#x2014;indented in the floor, was the archi-<lb/>
tectural descendant of the pit house. This barely visi-<lb/>
ble structure was covered by the earthen floor of a plaza that served, as we have already noted, as a daily work space and, in some cases, as a ritual dancing ground.</p>
<p>Above all, the purpose of the <hi rend="italic">kiva</hi> and the plaza above it is to provide a space in which humans can acknowledge and participate in the cosmic connection between the bowl-imaged earth and the basket-sym-<lb/>
bolized sky, affirm the orientation of their community with respect to the cardinal compass points and sacred mountains and mesas, and experience the life breath that flows throughout this universe. Larger pre-Co-<lb/>
lumbian pueblos often had several functioning <hi rend="italic">kivas</hi> to serve the various clans within them. Although built above ground, the <hi rend="italic">kivas</hi> of today are still circular structures without any aspiration toward monumen-<lb/>
tality in the European sense.</p>
<p>Centering according to an <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> estab-<lb/>
lished at a place of community focus and cosmic ritual could assume vast regional dimensions as illustrated by the great ancestral Puebloan center at <name type="place">Chaco Can-<lb/>
yon</name> (fig. 1.32). Recent archaeological discoveries in the Four Corners area reveal a far-flung road system drawing many ancestral Pueblos, including those at Mesa Verde and Canyon de Chelly, into a spatial rela-<lb/>
tionship with this important ceremonial nexus.<ref target="#CH1-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref>

Archaeologists refer to this important urban complex as "the Chaco phenomenon." They face many unan-<lb/>
swered questions as they continue to study <name type="place">Pueblo Bonito</name>, <name type="place">Chetro Ketl</name>, and other Great Houses in the center of the canyon along with the "outliers," ance-<lb/>
stral Puebloan ruins with large ceremonial <hi rend="italic">kivas</hi> and ancillary residential or storage chambers, such as are found at Aztec and Salmon. They have discerned at least seven sets of roads, which collectively comprise nearly 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers), radiating from Chaco, and some suggest that at least one of the roads, which they call the Great North Road, because of its alignment within one-half degree of true north until it bends to a two&#x00B0; angle to focus upon an important cone-shaped mound, "is a cosmological expression of the Chaco culture."<ref target="#CH1-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref> The fact that this is a road lacking a clear practical destination supports such a conclusion.</p>
<p>Indifferent to topography, the Chacoan roads scale canyon walls by means of wooden stairs or steps carved into bedrock or built of masonry, but, where they change direction, they do so at an abrupt angle, usually at the site of a Great House or at a <hi rend="italic">herradu-<lb/>
ra</hi>&#x2014;a low, horseshoe-shaped enclosure, frequently located at a high point where there is a distant view. Where they traverse slick rock, their course is some-<lb/>
times etched by a single shallow groove. No one knows the exact function of these <hi rend="italic">herraduras</hi>, but they may have been roadside shrines. There is little road-<lb/>
side debris or other evidence of overnight camps such as traders would have left and no evidence that the roads were used after the climax of Chacoan culture around 1140 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> Like the Maya causeways and the Inka roads in <name type="place">Peru</name>, the Chacoan roads were probably used for ceremonial purposes, and concentrations in various roadside locations of ceramic shards that appear to have been ritually broken suggest this pos-<lb/>
sibility. Allied with the roads were mesa-top signaling stations, which may have been used to transmit prac-<lb/>
tical messages, but which also probably functioned as observatories, thus serving a cosmological purpose.</p>
<p>Supporting the conclusion that Chaco was an important festival center in the ancient Southwest is the presence directly opposite <name type="place">Pueblo Bonito</name>, on the south side of the Chaco Wash, of a <hi rend="italic">kiva</hi> more than 63 feet (19.2 meters) in diameter called <name type="place">Casa Rinconada</name>, possibly the largest <hi rend="italic">kiva</hi> the ancestral Puebloans ever built (fig. 1.33). In its orientation and design, <name type="place">Casa Rinconada</name> appears to symbolize the ancient Puebloan cosmos. The axis running through its north and south doorways is aligned within a fraction of a degree of time north, and the four sockets for the large timber roof supports form a perfect square, each side of which is also true to a cardinal direction within a frac-<lb/>
tion of a degree. On the inside of its circular masonry wall were cut twenty-eight niches, with a possible additional one making twenty-nine. These may have had a relationship to the 29.5-day lunar month. Six larger, irregularly spaced niches were also cut into the wall. The northeastern roof support might have blocked its passage, but archaeologists have noted that a beam of light entering the <hi rend="italic">kiva</hi> today on the day of the summer solstice illuminates one of the larger niches. Within <name type="place">Pueblo Bonito</name>, window perforations appear to have been positioned to allow light to travel in a pattern across a wall surface in a manner that both predicts and marks the winter solstice. Whether or not Chacoan priests used these features in making their calendrical notations, it is certain that here, as else-<lb/>
where in the region of ancient habitation by Puebloan peoples, they studied the movement of celestial bod-<lb/>
ies and reflected their astronomical knowledge in their lives and in the landscape, timing their ritual and agri-<lb/>
cultural practices and aligning their buildings and roads with the positions of the Sun, stars, and planets in the sky.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second third of the twelfth century, Chaco's importance as the area's controlling political force suddenly waned. By the middle of the twelfth century, the Chacoans had stopped all construction, and they no longer orga-<lb/>
nized ceremonial festivals in the canyon. At Chaco and its outliers, by 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, many roads had been ritually closed and the ceremonial rooms of Great Houses dismantled and burned. At the same time, new settlements appeared around Black Mesa in what is now northeastern <name type="place">Arizona</name> and in the Rio Grande Valley, and these became the ancestral communities of the Hopi, Zuni, and Rio Grande pueblos of today.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Inka Shrines</hi></hi></head>
<p>The Inka civilization that flourished in the fifteenth century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> revered as one of its sacred sites Tiwa-<lb/>
naku, a cosmologically planned city built on the altiplano in the flat basin around Lake Titicaca between around 400 and 1100 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> Like other real and imaginary lakes of Native American mythol-<lb/>
ogy, Lake Titicaca played a significant role as the place of human origin. To the ancient inhabitants of the altiplano, its bowl shape and watery depths symbolized the feminine principle and embryonic gestation, whereas the rigid, dry, glaciated peaks around it had an obvious association with mascu-<lb/>
linity (fig. 1.34).<ref target="#CH1-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref> Lake Titicaca, in other words, was a natural form that perfectly represented the womb of earth and its center, while its jagged hori-<lb/>
zon line of mountains helped mark the cardinal points, pinning the sky with its beneficent sun and revolving stars and planets to the landscape plain around it.</p>
<p>Upon ascending the throne, each Inka ruler undertook a major building program as a means of asserting authority. Dynastic power and the cosmic connectedness of the empire, which extended 2,700 miles (4,345 kilometers) from north to south along the Pacific coast of <name type="place">South America</name>, was evident in the four highways emanating from Cuzco's central plaza. From the consequent division of the surrounding countryside the empire took its name, Tahuantinsuyu, "Land of the Four Quarters." A network of highways covering approximately 19,000 miles (30,000 kilometers), over which teams of runners coursed on government busi-<lb/>
ness, allowed the Inkas to maintain their sway. Shrines in nature also helped weave the empire into a cultural unity. The ruined center of Tiwanaku on Lake Titicaca was one of these sacred sites, lending to the Inkas increased authority over the local population and link-<lb/>
ing them with that city's ancient builders. Here, on an island, <name type="pname">Topa Inka</name> (ruled 1471&#x2013;1493 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) enlarged a temple dedicated to the Sun and planted a grove of trees in the sacred precinct that enclosed a rock, believed to be the sun's place of origin and the spot where life began. Ritual processions to this mytholog-<lb/>
ically designated origin rock passed through a series of ceremonial gateways.</p>
<p>Other nature shrines included springs, mountain peaks, and venerated stones called <hi rend="italic">pururuacas</hi>, which were considered to be transformed warriors. Promi-<lb/>
nent and distinctively shaped rocks were often singled out within the landscape and given sacred status. A special boulder would receive an architectural enclo-<lb/>
sure, and a bedrock outcrop could be carved as a royal dais. Mimetic rocks, those whose outlines echoed dis-<lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
<pb n="53" type="orig"/>
tant mountains, might be assigned iconic status (fig. 1.36). Altogether, 328 <hi rend="italic">huacas</hi>, or sacred places, were sited along forty-one sight lines, called <hi rend="italic">ceques</hi>, which emanated like sun rays outward from Cuzco. At these shrines, travelers and pilgrims made votive offerings of beautifully woven cloth, figurines in stone and pre-<lb/>
cious metals, and broken shells. They also deposited food and drink for the indwelling spirits of the <hi rend="italic">huacas</hi>.</p>
<p>In some <hi rend="italic">huacas</hi> sacrificed children were interred. They had served as participants in a ritual designed to bond the far-flung empire into a more secure religious union. The children, aged six to ten and chosen for their beauty and family status from villages throughout Tahuantinsuyu's four quarters, were consigned to the company of priests with whom they traveled the net-<lb/>
work of highways that led to Cuzco, where they were-<lb/>
greeted with pomp. There boys and girls were paired in symbolic marriage ceremonies and paraded sol-<lb/>
emnly around the main plaza, the heart of the Inka universe. After the celebrations were over and the chil-<lb/>
dren had been properly feted, the traveling parties returned to their home villages. But this time they did not journey along the system of highways, but crossed the arduous terrain in straight paths following the sacred <hi rend="italic">ceque</hi> lines. Each group was preceded by chant-<lb/>
ing Inka officials carrying statues and valuable offer-<lb/>
ings. Once they were received back home with honor, the children, dressed in finery and accompanied by figurines and other offerings, were placed in one of the local <hi rend="italic">huacas</hi> and interred alive. In this way the Inka-<lb/>
empire wove space into a fabric of power in which local places and Cuzco were tightly bound by ritual ceremony and pilgrimage along the <hi rend="italic">ceque</hi> lines.</p>

<p>Like the wide Chacoan roads, the mysterious lines in <name type="place">Peru</name> in the area embraced by the Nazca River system in <name type="place">South America</name>, dating from 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> to 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, raise many unanswered questions, but we can surmise that they also had ceremonial and religious signifi-<lb/>
cance. Archaeoastronomers have discerned alignments of the Nazca lines corresponding to solar events on the horizon and the positions of certain important constel-<lb/>
lations in the sky (fig. 1.35). The delineation of what were probably long-distance pilgrimage ways that also functioned as cosmological reference points in two

<p>But how do we attempt to explain the Nazca lines that are not straight: the geoglyphs&#x2014;giant figures of birds, fish, mammals, insects, and even anthropomorphic creatures "drawn" on the hard desert surface as paths 4.5 feet (1.37 meters) to 9 feet (2.74 meters) wide, which were created by scraping away the darker oxidized surface soil and placing it in small outlining ridges while exposing the lighter soil below? Are they clan totems or-<lb/>
etched forms with sacred meaning and ceremonial purpose to be traced with human footsteps as a means of absorbing their talismanic magic? It is easier to interpret the puma outline of the plan for Cuzco as a symbol of the Inka dynasty, but how can we explain the <name type="place">Great Serpent Mound</name> in <name type="place">Ohio</name>, now believed to date about 1000&#x2013;1140 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, and the so-called effigy mounds of the <name type="place">Upper Mississippi Valley</name>, which were built throughout the course of many centuries up until around 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>?

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Contemporary Pueblos of the American Southwest</hi></hi></head>
<p>The persistence of cultural memory and tradition is strong among Native Americans, and in parts of the American Southwest it is still possible to find land-<lb/>
scapes where a potent residue of a once-pervasive ethos of place is discernible. A visitor gradually per-<lb/>
ceives that a pueblo&#x2014;a settlement on tribal lands in northern and western <name type="place">New Mexico</name> and northeast <name type="place">Arizona</name>, consisting of multilevel adobe or stone dwellings built by the descendants of indigenous prehistoric peoples&#x2014;is sited not by happenstance but in a particular way that acknowledges the cardi-<lb/>
nal directions and mesa and mountain forms in the near and far distance. Here on certain feast days dancers animate a "heart" place, a central plaza enclosed protectively by attached dwellings, with practiced movements meant to evoke the spirits of animals and the cosmological forces associated with fertility, procreation, and the continuance of life.</p>
<p>Acculturation and the psychological compart-<lb/>
mentalization of two differing systems of belief are characteristic of extant Puebloan cultures, heirs to Catholicism by virtue of the Spanish Conquest. In <name type="pname">Santa Clara Pueblo</name>, as in <name type="pname">San Ildefonso Pueblo</name>, <name type="pname">San Juan Pueblo</name>, and <name type="pname">Santo Domingo</name>, the patron saint is honored with a mass on her or his feast day, but the more significant celebration from an ethnic per-<lb/>

the pueblo's main and subsidiary plazas. Dances are performed first in one plaza and then another by men and women, old and young, in fine cos-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>It is worth looking closely at one of the seem-<lb/>
ingly nondescript spaces where Native American dance ceremonies take place. Recalling her child-<lb/>
hood at <name type="pname">Santa Clara Pueblo</name>, the architectural histo-<lb/>
rian <name type="pname">Rina Naranjo Swentzell</name> has written:
<q>As the pueblo, or human space, was encircled by high mountains, low hills and flat fields, the center point (<hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi>), from which the people emerged out of the underworld, was also gir-<lb/>
dled by different spaces within the pueblo. The <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi>, marked by an inconspicuous stone, was located within the middle-heart place, or the plaza. The plaza was bounded by house structures, which in turn were encircled by the corrals or places where horses, pigs, and chick-<lb/>
ens lived. Beyond that, or sometimes overlap-<lb/>
ping, were the trash mounds. The trash mounds flowed into the fields, and from there the energy moved into the hills and mountains where it entered those far shrines, moved through the underworld levels or existences and re-emerged through the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi>.</q>
<q>The stories of the old people told us that we came to live on this fourth level of exis-<lb/>
tence with the help of plants, birds and other animals. Once we emerged out of the under-<lb/>
world, we continued to need those other living beings. In order to find the center point, or the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi>, the water spider and the rainbow were consulted. Water Spider spread its legs to the north, west, south and east and determined the middle of this world. Then, to make sure that Water Spider was right, Rainbow spread its arch of many colors to the north, west, south and east and confirmed Water Spider's center point. There the people placed a stone, and around that stone was defined the middle-heart place. Next, the living and sleeping structures were built in terraced forms, like mountains, with stepped tiers which enclosed and pro-<lb/>
tected the plaza, or the valley of the human place.</q>
<q>The house and kiva structures also emu-<lb/>
lated the low hills and mountains in their con-<lb/>
nectedness to the earth. The adobe structures flowed out of the earth, and it was often diffi-<lb/>
cult to see where the ground stopped and where the structures began. The house structures were, moreover, connected to each other, enclosing an outdoor space from which we could directly connect with the sky and focus on the moving clouds. Connectedness was pri-<lb/>
mary. The symbolic flowed into the physical world as at the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi> where the <hi rend="italic">po-wa-ha</hi> (the breath of the cosmos) flowed out of the underworld into this world.</q>
<q>The kiva structure was totally symbolic. Its rooftop was like the pueblo plaza space from where we could connect with the sky, while the rooftop opening took us into the kiva structure which was like going back into the earth via the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi> in the plaza. Within the feminine dark interior, the plaza-space configuration was repeated with the human activity around a <hi rend="italic">nan-<lb/>
sipu</hi>, the earth floor under and the woven-bas-<lb/>
ket roof above, representing the sky. The connecting ladder made of tall spruce or pine trees stood in the middle near the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi>. Everything was organized to remind us con-<lb/>
stantly of the primary connections with the earth, sky, other forms of life and the cosmic movement. These primary connections were continually reiterated.&#x2026;</q>
<q>Landscaping, or the beautification of out-<lb/>
door spaces, was a foreign concept. The natural environment was primary, and the human structures were made to fit into the hills and around boulders and trees. In that setting, plant-<lb/>
ing pretty flowers that need watering was ridic-<lb/>
ulous.<ref target="#CH1-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<pb n="56"/>
<pb n="56" type="orig"/>
<p>Swentzell is telling us, as an aside, that in a land-<lb/>
scape where the human connection to what has been called first nature (wilderness) and second nature (the agrarian landscape of fields and pastures) is para-<lb/>
mount, a "third nature" as represented by the garden (an enclosed landscape space in which art and nature are conjoined) is irrelevant.<ref target="#CH1-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref> Similarly, in discussing the form and function of the <hi rend="italic">bupingeh</hi>, as the plaza is called in the Tewa language, Swentzell remarks, "The emphasis of the <hi rend="italic">bupingeh</hi> is not on the substance but rather on the emptiness&#x2014;consequently, there are no statues, fountains, gazebos, park benches, grass, or flowers to enhance its appeal."<ref target="#CH1-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref> More than a void, however, the <hi rend="italic">bupingeh</hi> is instinct with life; it is the space for ceremonial dance, "the connecting space between the cosmic energies of the Pueblo world which flow out of the <hi rend="italic">nansipu</hi> through the physical space of the pueblo to the hills, far mountains, and clouds and back into the underworld."<ref target="#CH1-n24"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">24</hi></hi></ref> Thus, the Puebloan today, perceiving symbolism directly in the built and natural forms of a perfectly centered, emo-<lb/>
tionally rich environment does not need to sustain his or her imagination with metaphorically suffused gar-<lb/>
den and park spaces or with ornamental structures and horticultural concerns.</p>
<p>As we have seen, over time, Native North American populations migrated from one site to another in response to climatic changes, resource depletion, war, or other territorial imperatives. Because of their nature-oriented religious views, wherever they estab-<lb/>
lished themselves, site planning centered the commu-<lb/>
nity with one or more sanctified central spaces, often the nexus of axial relationships with both celestial and terrestrial natural phenomena&#x2014;equinoctial and sol-<lb/>
stitial positions of the sun, calendrical maximum and minimum rise and set points of the moon, the predict-<lb/>
ably timed appearance of certain auspicious constel-<lb/>
lations in the night sky, and mountain forms. Usually these directional lines of cosmological connectivity were implied, but in some places, such as the Four Corners areas of the Southwest or on the arid plains of <name type="place">Peru</name>, Native Americans inscribed axes upon the land.</p>
<p>Prayer and propitiation were the necessary, avail-<lb/>
able means with which agricultural people living within the bounds of limited systems of technology addressed uncertainty and the exigencies of their circumstances. Those architectural forms that brought them into closer contact with Sky Father, Sun, Rain God, Earth Mother, and Seed Goddess were the physical manifestation of a belief system that sought above all else fertility and the continuance of life. Eurocentric theorists once pre-<lb/>
sumed that the Maya and the Teotihuac&#x00E1;nos were influ-<lb/>
enced in the construction of their great pyramids by Old World contact, which somehow seeded this build-<lb/>
ing form in the New. A more convincing explanation is the cosmological one that the mountain-mimicking pyramid is a universal human phenomenon, a priestly platform for communication with sky-dwelling gods or a funerary monument for rulers whose divine status ensured the regular rotation of the sun in its diurnal and annual cycles. Circular forms echo the 360&#x00B0; horizon and are an important element of cosmic consciousness. <name type="pname">Jung</name> believed that circles are archetypal, magical rings drawn around that which would be protected as sacred. He pointed out that a mandala, or circle within a square, is like a <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi>, or sacred enclosure, protecting what is magical and holy.</p>
<p>Jungian theory and the cosmological orientation of many early religions would help explain how axial lines, circles, pyramids, and other geometrical forms can be manifested in landscape design in widely diver-<lb/>
gent times and places. By acknowledging the widely shared need among societies to attune themselves to a religiously perceived cosmic power we can explain the correspondence between landscape forms employed for ritual purposes by prehistoric and early ancient peoples in <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place">Asia</name> and their counter-<lb/>
parts, including contemporary native peoples, in the Americas. The important fact to ponder with regard to Mesoamerican pyramids and the Mississippian mounds built by the well-organized culture that flour-<lb/>
ished in the region around <name type="pname">St. Louis</name> between about 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> and 1500 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> is not their coincidental similarity to Old World "prototypes," but their sheer size and the amount of human labor their construction entailed. As in <name type="place">Egypt</name> and <name type="place">Mesopotamia</name>, belief in a religion medi-<lb/>
ated by a priestly elite was absolute, and it effectively prevented the subservient populace who built these monumental earth and stone works from refusing to work.</p>
<p>Cave sanctuaries, real and artificial mountains, earthworks, circular definitions of space, and the align-<lb/>
ment of axes with cardinal directions and the calendri-<lb/>
cal positions of celestial bodies constitute the primal components of landscape design dating from earliest times when humans perceived themselves to be embedded in nature and utterly dependent upon cos-<lb/>
mic forces. Gradually, during the first millennium <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, with the development of city-states, there emerged other ideals presupposing a more important role for humans in ordering life according to religious and eth-<lb/>
ical systems that placed them in fuller partnership with their gods. These values, too, dictated the shaping of space and the creation of places in which a newly minted vocabulary of classical forms that have remained influential throughout history was first man-<lb/>
ifested with great beauty.</p>

Murray Schafer</name>, <hi rend="italic">The Tuning of the World</hi> (<name type="place">Toronto</name>: McClelland and Stewart, <date when="1977">1977</date>), p. 157. Peripheral vision, rather than perspective focus, can be said to characterize the Chinese depiction of space, causing the eye to traverse from one viewpoint to another within the same work of art, with as much awareness of the peripheral areas as of the center; Byzantine art distorts scale and reverses perspective by increasing the size of distant objects; and Eskimo spatial represen-<lb/>
tation, probably because their landscape is spatially more amorphous than elsewhere, is unfocused in the way that acoustic space is multidirectional and has no fixed boundaries. Besides being analogous to unfocused, non-<lb/>
optical, aural space, Inuit space can be char-<lb/>
acterized as haptic&#x2014;space that is perceived by our own bodily presence within it. <name type="pname">Gilles Deleuze</name> (<date when="1925">1925</date>&#x2013;<date when="1995">1995</date>) and <name type="pname">F&#x00E9;lix Guattari</name> (<date when="1930">1930</date>&#x2013;<date when="1992">1992</date>), drawing on <name type="pname">Edmund Carpenter</name>'s description of Inuit space as having "no middle distance, no perspective, no outline, nothing the eye can cling to except thousands of smokey plumes of snow &#x2026; a land without bottom or edge &#x2026; a labyrinth alive with the movements of crowded people," have charac-<lb/>
terized this type of landscape as "smooth" space in which "there is neither horizon nor background nor perspective nor limit nor out-<lb/>
line orform nor center; there is no intermediary distance, or all distance is intermediary." See <name type="pname">Gilles Deleuze</name> and <name type="pname">F&#x00E9;lix Guattari</name>, <hi rend="italic">A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</hi>, trans. Brian Massumi (<name type="place">Minneapolis</name>: University of Minnesota Press, <date when="1987">1987</date>), p. 494. <name type="pname">Deleuze</name> and <name type="pname">Guattari</name> distinguish between smooth space&#x2014; as for instance the open sea, arctic wastes, and deserts, the trackless realm of nomads&#x2014; and "striated" optical space, where laws of perspective apply and distance is discernible and measurable. But in the two philosophers' view, much more than being categories of landscape analysis, smooth and striated space are cultural constructs. Because of the natural propensity of human beings to create order out of chaos, there is always a tendency to repli-<lb/>
cate cosmogenesis, to give smooth space a center and directional coordinates, thereby converting it into striated space. The reverse also can occur as when, for instance, we lose perspective in close distance or experience vision as a "sea" of impressions.</p></note>

The Tewa myths tell of the emergence of six pairs of brothers from an underworld lake when the earth was yet "half-cooked." Remaining below are the first mothers, Blue Corn Woman (the summer mother), White Corn Maiden (the winter mother), and the people awaiting release into the upper world. Each pair of brothers is asso-<lb/>
ciated with a particular color, which in turn is associated with north (blue), south (red), east (white), west (yellow), the zenith (dark), and the nadir (all-colored). Four of the pairs depart, each toward one of the cardinal directions, while the fifth and sixth head for the zenith and nadir. Before returning to the underworld to await the earth's readiness for the emergence of the people, the first four pairs of brothers throw some of the as-yet unbaked earth's mud at each of the four directions, creating the <hi rend="italic">tsin</hi>, or flat-topped mesas. The mesas have caves or tunnels running through them where dwell the supernatural <hi rend="italic">Tsavejo</hi>, or masked whippers. These are also the places where the <hi rend="italic">Towa &#x00E9;</hi>, spiritual guardians of the pueblo, reside. Beyond the mesas lie the sacred mountains, prominent peaks, each associated with one of the four cardinal points. The zenith is associ-<lb/>
ated with a large star, or perhaps Venus, in the eastern sky, and the nadir with the rainbow. Individual pueblos identify their communities with sacred mountains, and they continue to celebrate winter and summer with dances that honor White Corn Maiden and Blue Corn Mother.</p></note>

<figure xml:id="fig-43">

</figure>
<p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>he term <hi rend="italic">classical</hi> is important to our understanding of land-<lb/>
scape history. As used here, it signifies the aesthetic values embodied in Greek and Roman art and architecture: simplicity of form, harmonious proportion, and ornament that draws attention to significant parts of structures. It usually affirms symmetry over eccentricity, seeks the normative, and avoids the florid. <hi rend="italic">Classi-<lb/>
cism</hi> also embodies the notion of humanism, the system of thought that centers upon the capacities and values of human beings. Also inherent in the mentality of classicism is the ideal of the city as the locus for the good life, its citizens' beneficient mother, a landscape where the human and the natural are united in a bond sealed by divine visitation, bounty, and protection, a place from which exile was an extreme punishment.<ref target="#CH2-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Humanism</hi>, in fact, is the term European Renaissance intel-<lb/>
lectuals applied to their rediscovery of <name type="pname">Plato</name>, <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>, and the literary heritage of ancient <name type="place">Greece</name>, which had been preserved in certain Byzantine monasteries and the libraries of Arab scholars, and to the stylistic inspiration they derived both from ancient Latin authors and from Roman ruins and the works of ancient art and architecture. The rationality and order they found in classical architecture and planning expressed human values and human dignity to Renaissance societies. The same kind of regard accounts for the recurring appeal of the classical heritage of <name type="place">Greece</name> and <name type="place">Rome</name>, as witnessed in the Italian Renaissance, the French style of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Neoclassicism, and its twentieth-century variations, including the appropriation of the classical idiom by Postmodernists.</p>
<p>Although they are fused into a single legacy, we must not conflate Roman classicism and its Greek antecedents into a sin-<lb/>
gle style. They are, in fact, expressions of two separate cultures. Roman classicism is the product of a practical, pragmatic, and technologically advanced society. It is innovative within the bounds of a firmly established, large-scale cultural framework and, in spite of the persistence of cultic worship and superstition, confident of its ability to apply the forces of nature toward human ends.</p>
<p>In reconstructing the culture of Classical <name type="place">Greece</name>, we are able to consult written sources. History, literature, and philosophy offer an enriched perspective not available for subjects yielding only an archaeological record. With the written word, we have evidence of a people who had a fundamental grasp of the tragic nature of human existence and an enduring, deep interest in the transforming power of art. In their culture, we find myth and magic being challenged by reason. In landscape terms, this is expressed through the balanced tension of geometric forms bound in partnership with nature. The proportions and arrange-<lb/>
ment of these geometric forms speak to the supremacy ancient Greeks accorded mathematics&#x2014;the primary mode of reason&#x2014;as a means of understanding the cosmos and the natural world.</p>
<p>Earlier cosmologies were compounded of astronomical observation fused with myth. The first Greek philosophers, such as <name type="pname">Thales</name> and <name type="pname">Parmenides</name>, who lived on the Aegean coast of <name type="place">Asia Minor</name> in a period that spanned the late seventh, sixth, and early fifth centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, sought an underlying principle of rational unity governing all natural phenomena. Abstract rational logic&#x2014;deduction&#x2014;assumed value as a trustworthy means of appre-<lb/>
hending the world and attaining cosmological understanding. As these Greeks developed a philosophical, rather than a mytholog-<lb/>
ical, approach to viewing the world and themselves, they did not attempt to drain nature of the inherent divinity accorded it by earlier and contemporary people. Instead, they sought divine principles at work in nature. At the same time, their rationalism began the process of transforming the gods into allegorical rep-<lb/>
resentations of various ideals&#x2014;military prowess (Athena), rea-<lb/>
son (Apollo), fertility (Demeter), and family life (Hera)&#x2014;to name certain prominent members of the Greek pantheon.</p>
<p>Pythagoras, the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> philosopher who cre-<lb/>
ated a settlement with his followers at Crotona in southern <name type="place">Italy</name>,
<pb n="59"/>
<pb n="59" type="orig"/>
offered an approach to comprehending the world that was both intellectual and spiritual. Although Pythagoreans were sworn to secrecy, we believe that they combined the cultic rites of a mystery religion with the pursuit of truth through understanding mathemat-<lb/>
ical forms, musical harmonies, and the motions of the planets. This pursuit of religious meaning and rational truth at the same time provided an important cornerstone for the development of Western culture. It also aids our understanding of the premium the Greeks put on geometry and harmonic proportion in architecture. Seen in this light, the Parthenon, constructed during the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> on the Athenian Acropolis, demonstrates how they employed ratio-<lb/>
nality to serve an older myth-based religion that had been trans-<lb/>
formed to allegorize the virtues of the autochthonous, or indigenous, deity, Athena, the namesake city's patron goddess.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> of <name type="pname">Plato</name> (c. 428&#x2013;347 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) and the <hi rend="italic">Physics</hi> of <name type="pname">Aristotle</name> (384&#x2013;322 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) offer further understanding of how place was conceptualized in antiquity. They provide a philosophi-<lb/>
cal substructure for the shaping of landscape space and the siting of architectural monuments within it. In the dialogue of the <hi rend="italic">Timaens</hi>, <name type="pname">Plato</name> outlines a cosmology in which a nonspecific force called the Demiurge&#x2014;an invisible and all-encompassing God&#x2014;replaces the anthropomorphic deities who create cosmos out of chaos in the mythologies of pre-historic <name type="place">Greece</name> and the Ancient Near East. For material things to exist within the Platonic cosmos, there must be regions of occupancy&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">chora</hi>&#x2014;within the Receptacle, the fertile primary ground for world-being, in which partic-<lb/>
ular places&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">topoi</hi>&#x2014;are located. According to <name type="pname">Plato</name>, the <name type="pname">Demiurge</name>'s task is the fitting of forms, which are based upon abstract, geometrically determined, ideal Forms, into <hi rend="italic">topos</hi>&#x2014;in other words, the location of pattern-based matter <hi rend="italic">in place</hi> within regional space, or <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Plato</name>'s pupil <name type="pname">Aristotle</name> discarded the concept of objects derived from pre-existing, geometrically based Forms. He sought instead to abstract idealized prototypical Forms from the manifes-<lb/>
tations of forms in nature. Further, he ignored <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>, regional space, in his <hi rend="italic">Physics</hi>, claiming that "place is coincident with the thing, for boundaries are coincident with the bounded" (Book IV, 30). For <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>, things may move from place to place, and place is continually being filled with things, but <hi rend="italic">topos</hi> as the container of elemental form needs no regional context; place <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. For <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>, the universe is finite, spherically bounded, and Earth-centered; the cosmos has been so ordered by a Prime Mover, or God conceived as <hi rend="italic">Nous</hi>, pure mind. <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>'s approach is empirical; observation and sensory perception are its basis. But Aristotelian thought, which, though elaborated by later philosophers, remained the pri-<lb/>
mary Western intellectual framework until the sixteenth century, is not open-ended, inasmuch as it presupposes that sensory percep-<lb/>
tions and observations can order knowledge within a comprehen-<lb/>
sive system.</p>
<p>While philosophical thought does not inevitably dictate land-<lb/>
scape design form, we have already seen that the latter does express prevailing ideology, or cultural consensus. Forms may anticipate or follow ideas, but they almost always reflect the value systems that characterize a given society during the course of its existence. It is therefore possible to discern within the landscapes of classical antiquity as well as throughout the rest of landscape design history a substructure of philosophical thought. Myth still plays a role in the Greek landscape, which is everywhere touched by Homeric themes, but, if we choose also to read Greek landscapes as mani-<lb/>
festations of the mathematically oriented and spatially descriptive cosmological view found in <name type="pname">Plato</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi>, philosophy's impor-<lb/>
tance as an intellectual force in shaping them is also apparent.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Plato</name>'s cosmology has a physical counterpart in the ordering of urban landscape space. This is evident from the earliest devel-<lb/>
opment of the Greek city-state beginning in the eighth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> when the center and the outlying environs were conceived as the complementary components of <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>, or regional space.<ref target="#CH2-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> On the other hand, <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>, who tutored <name type="pname">Alexander the Great</name>, had a profound influence upon subsequent Western intellectual devel-<lb/>
opment as it was fostered within the crucible of Hellenism. His cosmic view of the inseparable nature of form and <hi rend="italic">topos</hi> was man-<lb/>
ifested in rationally ordered, enclosed spaces. From late antiquity until the sixteenth century, <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>'s belief in the unity of form and <hi rend="italic">topos</hi>&#x2014;of place as spatial containment&#x2014;prevailed alongside his concept of knowledge as a comprehensive, circumscribed sys-<lb/>
tem. To chart the shift from an approach that can be described as the weaving of a loose fabric of regional landscape to Aristotelian place-making is to understand an important aspect of the difference between <name type="place">Greece</name> and <name type="place">Rome</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref> In the former, temples were sited in nature and worshipers came to them in procession. In the latter, the relationship of architectural forms to nature was of less importance than readily replicated spatial arrangements that symbolically aggrandized rulers of the imperial state.</p>
<p>As we shall see, the Greek city, or <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, is bipolar. Important civic temples and monuments were located at or near a central gathering place, the <hi rend="italic">agora</hi>,_where political, judicial, and market activities occurred, and religious sanctuaries were located outside the town within the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>, the regional domain of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>. Where Greeks established colonial cities, imposing their institutions on pre-existing populations, exurban sanctuaries served the purpose of fostering political and social cohesion among disparate peoples. Although a loose girdle of fortified walls protected the Greek city, it had a strong sense of its relationship to its <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>. Enclosed, but not self-contained, the city sent out tentacles in several directions: to the sea as well as to the valley, plain, and hills, where were situ-<lb/>
ated the <hi rend="italic">demes</hi>, the politically affiliated regional villages or towns within the territorial framework of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>. Here in the agrarian countryside were the sanctuaries of the cults that received the mem-<lb/>
bers of both the city and villages on the festival occasions. Devotees came in procession to the sacrificial altars where bonds between the civic core and the life-sustaining hinterland were implicitly renewed. In this fashion, the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>_claimed and made manifest its occupation of an entire region of which the fortified city with its civic deities was simply one pole, while the outlying territory of the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> was the other. Further uniting the urban and the natural land-<lb/>
scape were the nature shrines&#x2014;sacred woods, springs, and moun-<lb/>
tain caves&#x2014;where a <hi rend="italic">daemon</hi>, or genius of the place, drew supplicants.</p>
<p>By contrast, <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>'s philosophical notion of the particular emplacement of things within a specific locale (<hi rend="italic">topos</hi>) that is
<pb n="60"/>
<pb n="60" type="orig"/>
strictly bounded, with exact limits, outlines, and surface planes, finds cultural expression in landscape design terms in the progres-<lb/>
sive enclosure and definition of urban space throughout the Helle-<lb/>
nistic and Roman periods. The result was a multiplication of similarly planned, symmetrically arranged, inward-focused spaces, and the replication of the city itself as such a space through coloni-<lb/>
zation. The Greek urban-exurban continuum, with loosely girdled cities connected to sanctuaries in nature by pilgrimage routes, was gradually abandoned in favor of precisely walled, institutionally self-contained urban centers, which were connected not to sacred sites in nature, but to one another and to the all-important capital of the empire, <name type="place">Rome</name>, by a far-flung network of roads.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Aristotle</name>'s concept of physics, as well as his notion that all knowledge can be organized within an ultimately finite and there-<lb/>
fore self-contained system, is an intellectual approach well suited to imperial objectives in which there is a strong penchant for order and administration. Inevitably, a good deal of the old awe and rev-<lb/>
erence for landscape forms bequeathed by earlier peoples became less compelling as urbanization and the political machinery for its maintenance assumed paramount value during the course of the empire. Roman urban plans, public spaces, and peristyle gardens evolved from models built in the Hellenistic period, dating roughly from the time of <name type="pname">Alexander</name> the Great (ruled 336&#x2013;323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) to the accession of the emperor <name type="pname">Augustus</name> in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> At these various scales, Roman landscape design expressed a sophisticated civiliza-<lb/>
tion's material wealth, imperial power, apparatus of systematic administration, and sensual enjoyment of plants, water, and open-<lb/>
air living.</p>
<p>New colonial towns, with their paved, sidewalk-bordered streets, demonstrated formulaic axial planning and advanced con-<lb/>
cepts of engineering. Rectangular and walled, these towns were directed inward toward a center: a forum sited at the intersection of the two principal crossroads. The forum itself was enclosed by a peristyle, a colonnaded, roofed walkway. Unlike the <hi rend="italic">agora</hi> of Greek cities, the forum was not penetrated by through traffic. Roman houses, like their Hellenistic predecessors, had featureless street facades. Their rooms were organized around and faced on an atrium, or central court, which was partly open to the sky. Some affluent Romans also had peristyle gardens, that is, rear gardens surrounded by porticoes.</p>
<p>To emphasize the interiority of Roman planning is not to say that Romans were indifferent to landscape features or insensitive to natural beauty. Their appreciation of natural scenery can be seen in the siting of buildings, particularly the villas that multiplied as wealth increased in the imperial age, and in the wealth of images drawn from nature that are found in the fresco paintings that deco-<lb/>
rated Roman walls. For members of the leisure class, the concept of a view became what we think of when we use the term today: an agreeable prospect of local scenery. Superstitions persisted from the centuries when there was less technological skill available for shaping nature to serve human ends, but in this highly urbanized and secularized society, the profoundly felt spiritual link with nature of earlier cultures had been broken. The <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi>, a grotto designed to appear as the abode of nymphs, became the architectural substitute for the goddess-inhabited cave of old.</p>
<p>Everywhere throughout the Roman empire, the surveyor's line and rod superimposed a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> order upon nature. One has only to think of their hydraulic engineering and aqueduct construc-<lb/>
tion to realize the degree to which the Romans exercised unprece-<lb/>
dented control over nature, enhanced the life of cities, and made possible the creation of the ornamental garden.</p>
<p>Worldly power and earthly pleasure&#x2014;these are the twin mes-<lb/>
sages encoded in Roman town planning and landscape design. But civilization has its price: longing for an imagined lost golden age of innocence in which the bond with nature is not yet broken. The distance between the eighth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> of <name type="pname">Homer</name> and the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> of Virgil is the distance between a view of nature as an epic stage for the drama of gods and humans enacting their mutual fate and a view of nature as the idyllic counterpoint to civ-<lb/>
ilization, the province of pastoral poetry. Not surprisingly, in this period, wealthy people developed an urbane appreciation of rural life. The villa, with its gardens and fountains, is an expression of that taste and a model for subsequent developments in landscape design.</p>
<p>The villa of the Roman Empire provides evidence of a new cultural role for landscape: the thematic one. Wealth and cosmo-<lb/>
politan urbanity bred the desire to create associational landscapes, places where allusion was made through place-names, architectural replication, and sculptural dramatization to other esteemed land-<lb/>
scapes and landmarks or scenes from myth and literature. Thus, the grounds of opulent villas, notably <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s at <name type="place">Tivoli</name> outside <name type="place">Rome</name>, became in effect theaters of the imagination. Although designed as a private retreat for the refined leisure of an emperor rather than as a commercial venture appealing to a mass audience, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa can be compared to a contemporary theme park in this regard. In Roman times, as imagination began to operate in shaping programs of landscape design, the garden took on the char-<lb/>
acter of an allegorical space. And, as we shall see, it eventually became a metaphor for both the Christian and Islamic visions of paradise, as the philosophy and practices of the antique world were replaced by different beliefs about the nature of creation and the organization of human life.</p>
<p>In this chapter, then, our task is to trace a course that takes us from a human association with the landscape that assigned divinity to certain sites in nature and placed built structures in relationship to these spirit-inhabited places, to one that created forms that in themselves confidently articulated human aspirations and power within a rapidly urbanizing world. We are thus traversing an import-<lb/>
ant trajectory in the development of Western attitudes. It is one in which an ideology of subservience to nature begins to give way to one of dominance over nature. In this process, the magic once per-<lb/>
ceived in nature is replaced by confidence in human action. The Greek experience is remarkable for the development of many of the philosophical, social, and political ideas that still resonate within the cultures of contemporary societies as well as a vocabulary of build-<lb/>
ing forms that has been re-employed throughout Western history. For us here, it is remarkable especially for the attitudinal equilibrium it achieved between religious awe in the face of the universe and proud trust in the powers of reason, a tension beautifully expressed in terms of landscape design.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Homer</name>'s great epic poems, the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>, composed probably in the eighth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, reveal to us a confident civilization of youthful promise, at a time when it was fashioning for itself a glorious nar-<lb/>
rative of its history as a diverse but culturally united people. Valor in war, accomplished horsemanship, and the consoling power of a well-developed sense of beauty are intrinsic to this worldview. The worship of trees and aniconic stones&#x2014;nonrepresentational, non-<lb/>
symbolical forms&#x2014;had been superseded by the per-<lb/>
sonification of divinity. Although the powers and personalities of the gods and goddesses were still in the process of formation, it is clear that they populated the collective imagination not as representatives of an ethical system or figures commanding worshipful love, but rather as projections of the human psyche and personifications of various aspects of human life. As such, they acted as the idealized and worthy guard-<lb/>
ians of human society and served as socializing forces, bonding disparate peoples into larger territorial groups through common worship.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Greek Myth, Religion, and Culture</hi></hi></head>
<p>In fashioning their myths, the Greeks took their native inheritance, Minoan and Mycenaean religions&#x2014;which are believed to have been centered upon wor-<lb/>
ship of a Great Goddess or Earth Mother&#x2014;and added to them divinities derived from <name type="place">Asia Minor</name>. Thus, Athena, the majestic patron of the arts and the goddess of reason and justice, probably traced her origin to the Earth Mother in Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. However, <name type="pname">Apollo</name>, the god of light, order, and inspira-<lb/>
tion, was perhaps the descendant of a god worshiped in the region formerly called Anatolia, the large pen-<lb/>
insula now occupied principally by <name type="place">Turkey</name>. These gods can be seen as archetypes of emerging aspects of civilization at a period when primal beliefs were grad-<lb/>
ually being replaced by a more rational, ethical, and scientific outlook. Greek religion was nevertheless still firmly embedded in the matrix of nature. On the Athenian Acropolis, a shrine for the worship of the rustic god Pan is evidence of the duality implicit in Greek religion, which acknowledged the wild, irratio-<lb/>
nal impulses associated with human sexuality along-<lb/>
side the civilized values personified by Athena.</p>
<p>There were numerous holidays in which proces-<lb/>
sion, worshipful slaughter, and feasting helped forge the bonds of community and civic pride among all the inhabitants of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> and sometimes between neigh-<lb/>
boring city-states (<hi rend="italic">poleis</hi>), while placating the divini-<lb/>
ties that were believed to ensure cosmic order. With the notable exception of <name type="place">Athens</name>, where the reverse was true in the case of its principal festival, the Pana-<lb/>
thenaia, these processions took the people from the city into the exurban landscape, where many of the important religious sanctuaries were located, thereby affirming the territorial dominance of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> over its surrounding agrarian countryside. These ritual festi-<lb/>
vals held in nature also served as initiatory rites for adolescents as they became participants in civic life. In ancient Sparta, where the city-state played an espe-<lb/>
cially strong role in the education of children and ado-<lb/>
lescents, the festivals were connected with the worship of Artemis Orthia.</p>
<p>The increasing power of the aristocracy spurred the creation of the arts and the organization of athletic competitions. The festivals were characterized by communal procession and sacrifice performed before the sanctuaries of the gods, as well as by dancing and athletic and dramatic competition performed in the gods' honor. <name type="pname">Dionysus</name> became the patron deity of the theatrical arts, and when the plays of <name type="pname">Aeschylus</name>, <name type="pname">Soph-<lb/>
ocles</name>, and <name type="pname">Euripides</name> were performed, it was at the <name type="pname">Great Dionysia</name>, the important dramatic festival com-<lb/>
petition held every four years at <name type="place">Athens</name>. At <name type="place">Olympia</name>, the Panhellenic (all-Greek) festival of games sacred to <name type="pname">Zeus</name> was begun in 776 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and continued at four-<lb/>
year intervals for the next thousand years. <name type="pname">Zeus</name> also presided over the Nemean Games, while Apollo was honored in the athletic festival held at <name type="place">Delphi</name> and <name type="place">Poseidon</name> in the contests that took place at the <name type="place">Isthmus of Corinth</name>. Truces among warring city-states were maintained to allow the contestants and spectators to arrive safely at these Panhellenic celebrations.</p>
<p>People also made pilgrimages to important shrines, particularly the one at <name type="place">Delphi</name>, to find spiritual guidance. The desire to chart a safe course, whether through the perils of statecraft or one's own lifetime, made oracular consultation a popular religious exer-<lb/>
cise in a society that saw human activity as drama directed from on high, the plot of which could be dis-<lb/>
cerned by the spirit forces of the earth.</p>
<p>The Greek political system, with its isolated city-<lb/>
states, accounted for the many festivals of various kinds held throughout the mainland and the Pelopon-<lb/>
nese, the large peninsula below the <name type="place">Gulf of Corinth</name> that consitutes the southern part of <name type="place">Greece</name>. Altars stud-<lb/>
ded both the rural and urban landscapes, as animal sacrifice, an essential and integral part of every festival including those featuring athletic games, was neces-<lb/>
sarily performed out-of-doors. Ritual sacrifice was only one manifestation of the interrelationship of the human, animal, and divine in ancient <name type="place">Greece</name>. There was considerable overlap between urban and agrarian spheres, and objects in nature were everywhere
<pb n="62"/>
<pb n="62" type="orig"/>
charged with magical meaning. By roadsides, sacred stones glistened with oil where passersby offered liba-<lb/>
tions. Caves and springs, often the sites of votive shrines, served as places of human purification. Fre-<lb/>
quently sanctuaries encompassed sacred springs, and often there were sacred groves nearby as well. Certain trees became identified with particular divinities: the olive tree was sacred to Athena, and a revered speci-<lb/>
men grew on the Acropolis; at <name type="place">Samos</name>, a willow's branches hung over Hera's sanctuary; on Delos, a palm tree commemorated a similar tree upon which Leto had leaned when giving birth to Artemis and Apollo; at Dodona, the oracle imparted wisdom through the rustling branches of an oak; at <name type="place">Didyma</name>, <name type="place">Daphni</name>, and <name type="place">Delphi</name> grew the laurel tree sacred to Apollo (fig. 2.1).</p>

<figDesc>2.1. The Athenian Acropolis with the olive tree planted to commemorate the presence in antiquity of Athena's sacred tree. It stands in the courtyard of the Erechtheion where it is believed that a charred olive tree managed to sprout leaves, bringing hope of renewal and rebirth of the Athenian <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> after the Persians had burned and razed the buildings of the Acropolis in 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> The Erechtheion housed a <hi rend="italic">xoanon</hi>, the ancient cult statue of Athena. The caryatids that form the columns of its south porch overlook the fire-scarred foundation stones of the Old Temple of Athena. Although the Acropolis was rebuilt later in the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> by <name type="pname">Pericles</name>, and the Parthenon became the majestic replacement of the destroyed temple, its site was always considered by Athenians to be hallowed ground.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>The columned temples that began to appear from the eighth century onward throughout <name type="place">Greece</name> were not houses of worship. Instead, they were conspicuous and worthy "residences" of large-scale sculptural rep-<lb/>
resentations of gods or goddesses associated with the sacred sites where they were built. These cult figures were occasionally carried in procession, but normally they remained within an interior chamber, or <hi rend="italic">cella</hi>, facing east toward the altar, which was set up within the sacred temple precinct in front of them.</p>
<p>A <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi>, a sacred landscape marked off by stones or encircled by a wall, might contain one or more temples. From a religious perspective, the motive for establishing a <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi> was the epiphany of a god in a particular spot. It was the sense of the indwelling spirit of the god&#x2014;the god or goddess man-<lb/>
ifesting himself or herself in a certain place&#x2014;that made that site holy. From a social and political per-<lb/>
spective, the sacral landscape provided a means of asserting territorial dominance by a particular <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, which is why the destruction of important exurban sanctuaries in wartime was tantamount to destroying a city itself.</p>
<p>The sanctification of a particular spot was sub-<lb/>
ject to various political considerations. At some sites, votaries of existing gods were reluctant to admit com-<lb/>
petition from a new deity. On the other hand, there were economic benefits to the communities where major deities were given residence, for pilgrims brought fees and a brisk production and sale of votive objects. A series of wars was actually fought to gain control of the Panhellenic sanctuary of <name type="place">Delphi</name>.</p>
<p>Topography and a tendency for siting within a well-chosen frame of the spirit-charged natural world dictated the location of temples and altars. Axiality for its own sake did not govern the planning of pre-Helle-<lb/>
nistic Greek temple precincts. Symmetrically laid-out terraces, colonnades, stairways, and altars were devices of the Hellenistic era; prior to the second third of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, in the Archaic and Classi-<lb/>
cal periods, the approach was less studied, and such axial relationships as existed were implied lines link-<lb/>
ing temples with particular distant mountains because of their associations of sanctity. The result was often a landscape "design" that we experience as dramatic and picturesque. These impressions, however, are informed by a modern sensibility. The Greeks did not see their temple precincts as we do&#x2014;as an artistic arrangement of bleached ruins haunted by vanished time, with mountains and sea completing the romantic
<pb n="63"/>
<pb n="63" type="orig"/>
scene. In their ascendant centuries, the temples were brightly painted, and pilgrimages to them were not those of tourists, but of religious suppli-<lb/>
cants. Nature and divinity were inextricably fused; landscape was experienced religiously rather than aesthetically.</p>
<p>The visible echoes of previous ceremony and custom only deepened the sanctity and fame of cer-<lb/>
tain sacred sites. Bloodstains on the altar, oil-<lb/>
anointed stones, accumulations of ash, bone, horns, and skulls&#x2014;these signs of others' piety provided the weight of tradition. Votive offerings (the source of lively local industry), valuables of all kinds, including but not limited to the paraphernalia of sacrifice (vessels, axes, roasting spits, and espe-<lb/>
cially, tripod cauldrons of metal) were contributed to the sanctuaries. Grateful victors donated shields and weapons of war. The victorious erected monu-<lb/>
ments and inscribed tablets proclaiming acts of glory. Various <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi>_built treasuries in the form of miniature temples, notably at <name type="place">Olympia</name> and <name type="place">Delphi</name>, to house valuable offerings and as further gifts to the presiding gods. <hi rend="italic">Stoas</hi>, long colonnades, roofed and with walls and often a series of rooms on the back side, provided shelter from the sun and an opportunity for the placement of more sanctified objects. Wealthy individuals contributed to the con-<lb/>
struction of stadiums and the many monuments that adorned the site. In this manner, important sanctu-<lb/>
aries became crowded with a host of structures, numerous memorial gifts, and votive offerings. Nowhere was this more evident than at <name type="place">Delphi</name>.</p>

<p>The most dramatic synthesis of site and sanctuary is to be found at <name type="place">Delphi</name>, the spiritual center sacred to all Greeks and a place where rivalries among <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> were superseded by bonds of Panhellenic identity (fig. 2.2).

<p>Pilgrimage to <name type="place">Delphi</name> was made both for the purpose of consulting the Delphic oracle on affairs of state and in order to participate in the sacred games. It was a journey of men rather than women, who lacked an official role in government and did not generally take part in athletic contests. After passing the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> <hi rend="italic">tholos</hi> and the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Temple of Athena Pronaia, marking the sanctuary of the goddess at <name type="place">Delphi</name>, one stopped at the Kastalian Spring, a long-estab-<lb/>
lished site of cult worship marking the place known as Pytho because here Apollo killed "the bloated, great she-monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth," thereby becoming Pythian Apollo according to the Homeric hymn.<ref target="#CH2-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref> It was believed that here Apollo had planted a branch cut from his sacred laurel tree in the Vale of Tempe, and because he had assumed the shape of a dolphin in order to steer the ship of the men from <name type="place">Crete</name> whom he had commandeered as keepers of his temple, he enjoined them to pray to him also as Apollo Del-<lb/>
phinius. Pilgrims to his Delphinius altar and partic-<lb/>
ipants en route to the Pythian Games, as the Panhellenic athletic contests held in Apollo's honor at <name type="place">Delphi</name> were called, purified themselves with a ritual bathing of their hair in the water of the spring.</p>
<p>Upon entering the <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi> of the Pythian Sanctuary of Apollo, which is perched on a flank of <name type="place">Mount Parnassus</name> beneath the sacred Korycian Cave and above a steep drop to the valley where the Pleis-<lb/>
tos River snakes to the sea, they embarked upon the Sacred Way, a switchback path leading to the Tem-<lb/>
ple of Apollo (fig. 2.4). This circuitous approach made access to the temple indirect, and intensified the dynamic relationship of the visitor to it and its dramatic surrounding landscape. Above the temple to the god loom the twin peaks of the Phaedriades, the Brilliant Ones. Though unplanned, this long-es-<lb/>
tablished approach route operated as an organizing force in the placement of the many treasuries and
<pb n="65"/>
<pb n="65" type="orig"/>
monuments scattered about the site. The reservation of certain portions of the site for particular rituals also helped to create some sense of discipline within the array of monuments and structures.</p>
<p>At a point where the Sacred Way reversed its course and headed due north, it passed the Rock of the Sibyl. This was believed to be the precise spot where the female voice of Ge, or Gaia, the earth god-<lb/>
dess, who had been worshiped here long before Apollo, originally offered oracular wisdom. Behind this boulder once stood the Archaic Sphinx of the Naxians: a crouched lion with eagle's wings and the visage of a woman held aloft on a tall Ionic column. With serene and enigmatic authority, it asserted the ancient rights of female prophecy within Apollo's sanctuary. Above the sphinx stood the peripteral col-<lb/>
onnade of the temple, and soaring above these, horn-<lb/>
like, were the twin peaks of the Phaedriades. Upon the temple terrace, engraved marble <hi rend="italic">stelai</hi> (of which one remains) and a fourth-century, 50-foot tall statue of Apollo gave majestic welcome to the pilgrim. Directly in front of the temple stood the Great Altar of Apollo, made of dark marble from the island of Chios, with white marble at its base and top.</p>
<p>In addition to a central hall, or <hi rend="italic">naos</hi>, the Temple of Apollo contained an inner chamber, called the <hi rend="italic">adyton</hi>, entered from above by steps. Beneath a stone canopy within the <hi rend="italic">adyton</hi> was a round stone covered with fillets woven into a net. This was <hi rend="italic">omphalos</hi>, the "navel" of the world and the "grave" of Dionysus, who was honored by an important biennial Delphic festival and was thus entitled to share with Apollo occupancy of the temple's most sacred area. A large tripod with a cauldron-shaped seat was placed next to the <hi rend="italic">omphalos</hi>. Within the belly of this tripod-caul-<lb/>
dron priests stored sacred objects. Upon it sat the Pythia, priestess of Apollo, freshly bathed in the Kastalian Spring, when it was time to utter prophecy. Beside her grew a sacred laurel tree.</p>
<p>Within the <hi rend="italic">hestia</hi>, or sacred hearth, burned lau-<lb/>
rel leaves and barley. The fumes from these enhanced the mystical atmosphere of the <hi rend="italic">adyton</hi> and presum-<lb/>
ably aided the prophetess in achieving a trancelike state known as <hi rend="italic">enthousiamos</hi>, in which the spirit of the god entered into her mind and mouth. Her speech, which was often unintelligible, was "translated" into hexameter verse by priests standing nearby. Thus, this temple, which was holy to all Greeks, was the place where art joined with the old mystical powers of the earth, and Apollonian light hised with the dark impulses of Dionysian spirit.</p>
<p>Assisting in this process at <name type="place">Delphi</name> was the the-<lb/>
ater, or rather a succession of theaters, the latest one, which seats five thousand people, dating from the time of imperial <name type="place">Rome</name> (fig. 2.6). Behind a horse-<lb/>
shoe-shaped orchestra, 60 feet in diameter, thirty-five rows of seats, broken at the twenty-eighth row by a <hi rend="italic">diazoma</hi>, or inside circular aisle, are set within the contours of the steep hillside. Here choristers sang hymns to Apollo, and playwrights and musicians competed for honor during various festivals, includ-<lb/>
ing the Pythian Games.</p>
<p>After 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, a stadium occupied a site far-<lb/>
ther up the hillside above the sanctuary and theater. Musical contests and, later, games were held there. During Roman imperial times, an Athenian philan-<lb/>
thropist gave the stadium its monumental entrance and stone seating for seven thousand spectators.</p>

<p>Among the most important festival centers of ancient <name type="place">Greece</name> is the sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidaurus, an ancient sanatorium where patients' dreams played a role in their diagnosis and where a special open-air sleeping area served as a therapeutic facility. Accord-<lb/>
ing to the Greek lyric poet <name type="pname">Pindar</name>, <name type="pname">Asclepius</name>, the son of <name type="pname">Apollo</name> and his mortal lover, <name type="pname">Coronis</name>, was raised by the centaur <name type="pname">Chiron</name>, who taught him the healing arts. While dedicated to Apollonian harmony of mind, body, and spirit, Asclepius was linked to the remote Greek past, and he therefore shares with the Cretan goddess <name type="pname">Potnia</name> the symbol of the snake. It is for this reason that the modern physician's emblem, bequeathed to us from ancient <name type="place">Greece</name>, is a <hi rend="italic">caduceus</hi>, a staff intertwined with snakes.</p>
<p>To the powerful natural serenity of the site at Epidaurus, cradled in undulating hills, was added the harmony of architectural geometry. <name type="pname">Polycleitus</name> the Younger designed the theater there in the fourth cen-<lb/>
tury <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e</hi>; it was enlarged in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> (fig. 2.7). The perfect circle of the orchestra is thought to be an outgrowth of the <hi rend="italic">halos</hi>, the circular threshing floor upon which the first ritual dances and dramas of ancient <name type="place">Greece</name> were performed. The ratio of its lower fan of thirty-four rows to its upper twenty-one (34:21), is 1.618, or that of the Golden Section.<ref target="#CH2-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref> The ratio of fifty-five total rows to its original thirty-four (55:34) is also close to 1.618. Further evidence of the use of the Golden Section as the underlying design principle by <name type="pname">Polycleitus</name> and his followers: the sum of the first ten numerical digits added together is fif-<lb/>
ty-five; the sum of the first six digits is twenty-one; and the sum of digits seven through ten is thirty-four. Even those unaware of Greek mathematics, however, feel intuitively the beauty derived from the combined power of site and geometry, of mountainous majesty and mathematical beauty.</p>
<p>In the process of enlarging both its form and its mean-<lb/>
ing, the Greek <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> had incorporated and absorbed its ancient acropolis, the fortified citadel that had once been the home of both the people and their gods. Though, with the important exception of <name type="place">Athens</name>, the residential and civic center was now separated from the outlying sanctuaries set in nature, both together constituted the regional space defined as <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>. City-<lb/>
scape, or the urbanized landscape, is an important part of our continuing story, and the Greek contribution to landscape design was certainly not confined to pil-<lb/>
grimage centers remote from the everyday haunts of humanity. Because the philosophical notion of <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> was one in which the festival center in nature was perceived as one pole of a spatial continuum and the urban center the other&#x2014;both together constituting the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, or city-state, a regional polity&#x2014;we must now look more closely at the civic component. Inevitably the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> as a governmental institution gave rise to new ideas about urban layout and new urban institu-<lb/>
tions, enriching the concept of city with customs and structures that reflected an independent, collective society. And, as is common knowledge, the Greek political concept of self-governance and the planning and architectural forms that expressed it have been vastly influential in the West throughout history.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Polis and Acropolis: City and Temple in the Greek Landscape</hi></hi></head>
<p>The Greek <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> was a crucible for a new social order. Democracy, or government by the people, was first conceived in ancient <name type="place">Greece</name>. Although the definition of citizenship was circumscribed and limited to prop-<lb/>
erty-owning males, the equality of this political sys-<lb/>
tem nevertheless carried with it respect for the individual and an ideal of justice according to stable, published laws. Democracy also embodied the notion of individual rights as well as that of individual responsibility for the collective good. More than sim-<lb/>
ply the expression of a political system, the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> was first and foremost a concept of community. Its actual form of governance&#x2014;monarchy, oligarchy, or democracy&#x2014;was not its distinguishing characteristic so much as the fact that power was exercised respon-<lb/>
sibly on behalf of the community.</p>
<p>In the Greek <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, the notion of divine kingship was untenable; the <hi rend="italic">basileus</hi>, or ruler, governed not as a god in the manner of an Egyptian pharaoh, but in partnership with the gods. He was, according to <name type="pname">Aris-<lb/>
totle</name>, responsible for the conduct of religious rites and traditional sacrifices, athletic contests such as torch races, public lawsuits dealing with impiety, and pri-<lb/>
vate ones when the charge was an important crime such as homicide. In <name type="place">Athens</name>, the title of <hi rend="italic">archon basileus</hi> was not hereditary; the office depended upon election by the citizenry and service was for a pre-<lb/>
scribed annual term. Monuments of grandeur cele-<lb/>
brating divine kingship such as are found in the Ancient Near East were therefore completely alien to Greek culture. Thus, it was the much-praised Greek genius for distributing and limiting power through a workable constitution, together with the democrati-<lb/>
zation of education and culture within the relatively small circle of those who met the criteria for citizen-<lb/>
ship, that gave the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> its highest meaning and mature form. To understand that urban form and the institutions produced by this radical social change, a brief discussion of Greek philosophy and Greek pol-<lb/>
ity as developed in <name type="place">Athens</name>, the most celebrated Greek city-state, is in order.</p>
<p>The Athenian Acropolis was rebuilt by <name type="pname">Pericles</name> in the middle of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, following a period in which its buildings lay in ruins after being burned in 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> by troops under the <name type="pname">Persian king Xerxes</name>. Its reconstruction was more than a manifes-<lb/>
tation of Athenian hegemony and Greek Classical grandeur. The monuments of the Acropolis, particu-<lb/>
larly the Parthenon, embodied a new philosophical understanding of the world. Although this building celebrated the great goddess Athena, who presided with serene dignity over the affairs of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, another, more abstract idea of deity was here given architectural expression. Confidence in human reason was superseding blind oracular wisdom. Further, the manipulation of human affairs by the Homeric pan-<lb/>
theon according to the particular dispositions of the various gods was now considered by many rational Greeks to be naive. The rule of Necessity (<hi rend="italic">ananke</hi>) alone did not provide an adequate philosophical or spiritual foundation for those who believed that intel-<lb/>
ligence&#x2014;reason itself&#x2014;was a godlike human gift.</p>
<p>The Greeks' philosophical quest for a rational understanding of an underlying harmony in nature is epitomized in the spirit of empyrean intellect that infuses the stones of the Parthenon with timeless beauty. It also informs the political concept of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>&#x2014;the rational city-state&#x2014;and the public spaces created for secular public life. Physically, according to <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>, the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> should consist of a population and territory large enough to suffice for the purposes of life, but not so large that the settled area could not be taken in in a single view. It should be defensible&#x2014;"difficult of access to the enemy, and easy of egress to the inhabitants"&#x2014;well situated with regard to the sea and the land, and "in size and extent it should be such as may enable the inhabitants to live at once temperately and liberally in the enjoyment of lei-<lb/>
sure."<ref target="#CH2-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref> It should have a natural abundance of springs and fountains in the town or, lacking these, a system of reservoirs to furnish ample pure drinking water. Straight streets "after the modern fashion which <name type="pname">Hip-<lb/>
podamus</name> [fifth-century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Greek city planner] introduced" should be laid out for the sake of beauty, but districts of these should be combined with quar-<lb/>
ters in which old-fashioned tortuous ways provided security because assailants would have difficulty in getting in and would also find themselves baffled in trying to get out. Further, cities should have walls as a precaution against siege, and "care should be taken to make them ornamental, as well as useful for warlike purposes, and adapted to resist modern inven-<lb/>
tions" with guardhouses and towers at suitable inter-<lb/>
vals.<ref target="#CH2-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> In addition to the temples in the surrounding countryside where ritual participants went in proces-<lb/>
sion on feast days, there should be temples and public dining halls for priests and magistrates in the upper "freemen's agora," a place of leisure in contrast to the lower "traders' agora."</p>
<p>The basic unit of the Greek <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> was the <hi rend="italic">deme</hi>, the regional village or town within the orbit of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Synoecism</hi>, or the amalgamation of several
<pb n="68"/>
<pb n="68" type="orig"/>
<hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">demes</hi> into a political unit under the author-<lb/>
ity of a single <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> gave certain cities broad regional authority. <name type="place">Athens</name> thus subsumed all of the <hi rend="italic">demes</hi> of Attica, and all property-owning males in Attica were considered Athenians. While the intensely competi-<lb/>
tive Hellenic spirit was responsible for constant rivalry and warfare among <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi>, the security bred of <hi rend="italic">synoecism</hi> made possible urban expansion beyond the high-walled citadels of Mycenaean times.</p>
<p>As the historian <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois de Polignac</name> suggests, <hi rend="italic">synoecism</hi> was facilitated by the religious cults that held festivals at sanctuaries set apart from the city.<ref target="#CH2-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref> Thus, in territory where the character of the god or goddess was not forcefully identified with the enfran-<lb/>
chised elite of free, property-owning males within a particular <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, women, foreigners, local populations, and members of neighboring <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> participated in forms of pan-Greek culture that produced a common-<lb/>
ality. Although there were festivals at nearby <name type="place">Eleusis</name> and at <name type="place">Sounion</name>, the Attic cape where <name type="place">Poseidon</name> was worshiped, <name type="place">Athens</name> was unique in focusing its spiritual life predominantly within its walls. This practice also helps explain why <name type="place">Athens</name> effectively placed all its bets on its maritime empire, importing grain as trib-<lb/>
ute, rather than asserting firm control over its imme-<lb/>
diate agricultural hinterland. Other <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> also had civic deities, including Athena, who protected the city and resided in sancturaries in the agora or upon an acropolis. But the exurban sanctuaries connected by processional routes to these cities, such as the Artemi-<lb/>
sion of Ephesus or the Heraion of Argos, were of even greater significance to their inhabitants because they encompassed the agrarian sphere that was vital to the city's well-being (fig. 2.8).</p>

</figure>
<p>A new urban nucleus, the agora, appeared as trade expanded and cities grew in population and size at the end of the Dark Age (c. 1100&#x2014;c. 900 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) that ensued after the collapse of Mycenaean civiliza-<lb/>
tion. This occurred as they began to spread beyond the zone of their original formation upon an acropo-<lb/>
lis, recentering themselves on the adjacent lower elevations. Eventually, as the evolving institutions of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> were given physical expression, those of law, justice, and civic ritual were positioned around the agora, which continued to assume importance as a public space. Market and trading functions clus-<lb/>
tered there. Further, it served as a communal meeting place where assemblies of various kinds could occur. Greek cities in general, but <name type="place">Athens</name> especially, thus came to have two nuclei: the acropolis, the zone of religion and communal tradition, and the agora, the place of government, commerce, and community life. Other functions such as artisans' shops and hous-<lb/>
ing were fitted in between and around these two important centers.</p>
<p>At <name type="place">Athens</name>, as the residential population aban-<lb/>
doned the Acropolis and spread out on the lower ground, temples were located in the vicinity of the Agora as well as in other places deemed appropriate to honor a god. As this occurred, the Acropolis became almost exclusively a religious precinct. The home of patron goddess Athena, whose temple, the Parthenon, was a lofty landmark visible from afar, the Acropolis profoundly embodied the city's commingled spiritual values and civic pride. The Propylon, the gateway separating the sacred space from the rest of the city, led through the entry building complex known as the Propylaia, which includes the beautiful small Temple of Athena Nike. Directly ahead is the ever-after-va-<lb/>
cant space and foundation stones whose rosy discol-<lb/>
oration is evidence still of the fiery destruction of the first temple to the goddess by the Persians. By con-<lb/>
trast, when one is facing outward toward the Saronic Gulf, it becomes evident that the Propylon was sited to frame the view of the island of <name type="place">Salamis</name>, where the Greeks decisively defeated the Persians, in 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi></p>
<p>Because Greek architects did not develop a method of building arched foundations and super-<lb/>
structures, the siting of their theaters and stadiums was dependent upon topography. The steep-pitched Greek theater especially needed to be fit within the contours of the terrain, and it is therefore frequently found on the slope of the old acropolis or nestled into a hillside near the edge of town.</p>
<p>Gymnasiums, although usually operated as pri-<lb/>
vate institutions, reflected the <hi rend="italic">polis'</hi> mission of <hi rend="italic">paideia</hi>, the education of its citizenry in body and mind. Gardens and <hi rend="italic">odeums</hi>, small buildings for the performance of music or the recitation of poetry, were part of such important gymnasiums as the Academy in <name type="place">Athens</name>, where <name type="pname">Plato</name> established his school. <hi rend="italic">Stoas</hi>, handsome colonnaded structures serving multiple purposes, were often used for public discourse of a philosophical nature and were features of the gymna-<lb/>
siums as well. Because of their campuslike nature and consequent need for space, gymnasiums were usually
<pb n="69"/>
<pb n="69" type="orig"/>
located on the edge of the city outside the town walls, often in association with a stadium and fre-<lb/>
quently in connection with a shrine dedicated to an appropriately vigorous deity, such as <name type="pname">Hermes</name> or <name type="pname">Heracles</name>, or some hero of local renown. Like the Persian hunting parks seen by Greek soldiers and described by the Greek historian <name type="pname">Xenophon</name> (c. 431&#x2013;c. 352 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), these were well-treed preserves set aside from the routine business of everyday life. The <hi rend="italic">palaestra</hi>, or wrestling ground, was an essen-<lb/>
tial feature of the larger and better-equipped gymnasiums, inasmuch as physical fitness was considered an indispensable part of edu-<lb/>
cation. Additional public <hi rend="italic">palaestras</hi> ensured that this important aspect of Greek life was readily available to the male populace as a whole.</p>
<p>Housing for the populace reflected the empha-<lb/>
sis upon public life in the Greek city. Since Greek males spent most of their waking hours engaged in pursuits that were conducted out-of-doors or in structures designed for societal purposes, dwellings were uniformly modest in size and completely lacking in the luxury that would later characterize upper-class Roman homes. Water provision was a critical consideration, and there developed, in addi-<lb/>
tion to wells and cisterns, aqueduct-fed fountains, which were later housed in special structures. Because Greek women had much less access than men to other parts of the public realm, they no doubt used these as informal social centers when they gathered to fill their am-phoras, or water jars.</p>
<p>Although Greek cities contained similar insti-<lb/>
tutions and building types, they enjoyed a wide variation in design. The most important difference in urban planning was the one that existed between the relatively unplanned growth of such cities as <name type="place">Athens</name> and the development by design of cities like Miletus in <name type="place">Asia Minor</name>. <name type="place">Athens</name>'s resistance to grid regularization even after this type of planning had become common can be explained by the observa-<lb/>
tion that historic circulation patterns are notably resistant to change. The unplanned aspect of a ven-<lb/>
erable urban center like <name type="place">Athens</name>&#x2014;or <name type="place">Rome</name> itself, for that matter&#x2014;where habitual land uses and hereditary property rights are firmly rooted, is val-<lb/>
ued above more rational geometric planning para-<lb/>
digms, even after these are routinely practiced elsewhere. For this reason and also because it was important to rebuild quickly in order to accommo-<lb/>
date a large returning population, <name type="place">Athens</name> (like <name type="place">Lon-<lb/>
don</name> after the Great Fire of <date when="1666">1666</date>) chose to reconstruct itself along irregular, "organic" lines following its destruction by the Persians at the beginning of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi></p>

<figDesc>2.9. Plan of Miletus. Miletus was laid out in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> as two grids, the more finely textured one with smaller street blocks to the north, and a looser-grained grid with two intersecting principal axes to the south. A band of public spaces containing various temples and a large agora traversed the town between the two grid sections. Descending from the Lion Harbor, which deeply penetrated the northern section of the city, was another arm of public space, and it, too, contained an agora. A long L-shaped <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi> fronted impressively on the Lion Harbor. It was backed by another L-shaped <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi> facing the town on the east. Additional <hi rend="italic">stoas</hi> made this agora in effect a peristyle court. By the middle of the 2nd century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, the considerably larger southern agora of Miletus had been similarly formed by the conjunction of independent <hi rend="italic">stoas</hi>. <hi rend="bold">A</hi> Lion Harbor. <hi rend="bold">B</hi> Northern Agora. <hi rend="bold">C</hi> Theater. <hi rend="bold">D</hi> Southern Agora</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>Miletus, on the other hand, presented with the same task of rebuilding after being destroyed by the Persian invaders, faced less immediate population pressure and adopted a grid plan of uniform blocks defined by regular streets of predetermined width crossing at right angles (fig. 2.9). Other Greek cities of <name type="place">Ionia</name> had employed at least a rudimentary version of the grid layout as early as the seventh century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> In fact, the development of orthogonal plan-<lb/>
ning&#x2014;i.e., the laying out of streets at right angles&#x2014;as a coordinated program in which the city itself was the focus and frame, not some pragmatic objective or ceremonial pur-<lb/>
pose, was a Greek achievement. Adopted by the Romans, who surveyed and divided land into squares according to a process called <hi rend="italic">centuriation</hi>, and promoted by <name type="pname">Thomas Jeffer-<lb/>
son</name> as the method of giving spatial coordinates to the entire American continent, the grid has proved a convenient way of parceling both rural and urban land and a convenient means
<pb n="70"/>
<pb n="70" type="orig"/>
of enabling circulation in cities throughout history.</p>
<p>Although the invention of the grid was attributed by <name type="pname">Aristotle</name> and others to the planner and urban the-<lb/>
orist <name type="pname">Hippodamus</name>, a native of the Ionian city of Mile-<lb/>
tus, he could not have originated its use. The logical means of subdividing land orthogonally that he employed in the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> had been used, at least for principal streets and temple complexes, by some earlier cultures, notably at <name type="place">Mohenjo-Daro</name> and <name type="place">Harappa</name> in the <name type="place">Indus River valley</name>, in <name type="place">Mesopotamia</name> where archaeologists have found traces of grid plan-<lb/>
ning at <name type="place">Babylon</name> and other ancient cities, as well as in some Assyrian, Egyptian, and Etruscan settlements. <name type="pname">Hippodamus</name> must have worked on the reconstruction of Miletus following the Persian devastation of that city before being called upon by the Athenians in the second quarter of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> to lay out their port city of <name type="place">Piraeus</name>.</p>
<p>Early colonial practice had placed the grid-di-<lb/>
vided land, with the exception of the agora and other public spaces, into the hands of a founding elite, with subsequent immigrants assigned the status of tenants. Hippodamian planning, by contrast, was based upon a political system in which the population of a town was divided into three classes&#x2014;artisans, soldiers, and farmers&#x2014;with three categories of land&#x2014;sacred, public, and private&#x2014;allocated either as general civic space or as real property. This early zoning code, as much as the physical layout of the grid, was an inno-<lb/>
vative concept that influenced later Greek city plan-<lb/>
ning. As for the Hippodamian plan itself, the town was formed <hi rend="italic">per stringas</hi>, a series of bands delineated by a few main east-west thoroughfares crossed by one or more major north-south arteries. Narrow lanes subdivided the rectangular units of land into blocks, which were then further subdivided into building lots. Because the blocks were more or less square, the resulting plan was that of a checkerboard.</p>
<p>According to <name type="pname">Polignac</name>, both civic cults and cults in nature were of particular importance in colonial cities.<ref target="#CH2-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> Their establishment invariably necessitated the building of a sanctuary for the Hellenic god or goddess, most frequently Apollo the founder or Ath-<lb/>
ena the protector, who served as the guardian of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> and the symbol of Greek hegemony within the newly claimed territory. In addition to the temple or temples located in the center, sanctuaries and shrines, usually dedicated to <name type="pname">Demeter</name>, <name type="pname">Artemis</name>, and deities associated with fertility and nature, were built in the periurban <hi rend="italic">chora</hi>. These served to claim the territory politically and also helped in the process of incorpo-<lb/>
rating native residents into the culture of Hellenism. In some cases, native populations syncretized the worship of pre-existing native divinities with the imported Hellenic ones. <name type="pname">Demeter</name> and her daughter <name type="pname">Kore</name> (<name type="pname">Persephone</name>) were universally popular because of their association with annual rebirth in nature, and the settlers usually located the shrines of chthonic deities like these where there were caves or springs, places that natives may have already adopted for their religious purposes. As was true in the mother <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> that founded these new cities, the civic shrines at the center were identified with the dominant ruling class, while the sanctuaries in the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> served to incorpo-<lb/>
rate into membership within the community at large women, indigenous peoples, other non-Greeks, and the agrarian population in general. The religious access offered by these sanctuaries was an important means of conquest and an essential feature of coloni-<lb/>
zation, serving to meld members of fragile heteroge-<lb/>
neous societies into viable communities.</p>
<p>Heroic monuments also played a role in forging civic identity. Cults based on tombs helped legitimize claims to land, serving to symbolize group sover-<lb/>
eignty in the same way as did the rural sanctuaries. Enshrined heroes were often founders of cities, their legendary kings, even though dynastic rulership was not a feature of the mature <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>. Mythical founders were adopted as a means of adding heroic stature to the civic identity of a <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>, as in the case of the Athe-<lb/>
nians, who incorporated the legendary hero Theseus into their urban mythology. In the fifth century, the ruler <name type="pname">Cimon</name> had <name type="pname">Theseus</name>'s putative remains taken from his first <hi rend="italic">heroon</hi>, or civic monument for the cel-<lb/>
ebration of heroes, which stood sentinel at the city gates, and placed in a new <hi rend="italic">heroon</hi> in the heart of the city. Later generations sometimes erected statuary within a rediscovered ancient necropolis, particularly when the site was conterminous with the agora, the city's principal political space. But even without funerary associations, monuments to heroes were placed in important parts of the city, protectively at its entrances or proudly in its center.</p>
<p>But monumentality as such was not a character-<lb/>
istic of the Greek city in the pre-Hellenistic period. Although the Greeks could achieve monumentality in architecture and sculpture, they did not consider either the organic or the gridded cityscape a planning means toward this end. The tools of urban monumen-<lb/>
tality&#x2014;formal symmetry and axial layout&#x2014;were not employed until Hellenistic and Roman times. Instead, a combination of forms was pleasingly dis-<lb/>
posed for convenience and commonsensical ends. The U-shaped arrangement of <hi rend="italic">stoas</hi> did set up certain loose symmetries, but this was more the result of adaptation to the dictates of orthogonal planning in the grid cities than to an intentional desire for gran-<lb/>
deur. Temples, agoras, gymnasiums, and other public or semipublic spaces were logically disposed within the frame of the grid, while theaters were placed
<pb n="71"/>
<pb n="71" type="orig"/>
according to the dictates of topography. Both "organic" and grid plans could produce aesthetically pleasing results.</p>
<p>Most apparent in the Greek city, whatever its form, is the primacy its population placed upon public space for public life. While public life in the form of ritual celebrations took place within the larger land-<lb/>
scape outside the city, there were within the city temple sanctuaries, particularly those honoring Athena or Apollo&#x2014;protectors of the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi>&#x2014;as well as other kinds of places for public assembly. As important car-<lb/>
riers of public life, the agora, the most important civic space, and the Greek theater, the site where the community's self-image received fullest expression, deserve our attention.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Athenian Agora</hi></hi></head>
<p>A closer understanding of the Greek urban landscape as an expression of culture necessarily requires a short account of the development of <name type="place">Athens</name> and its civic core, the Agora. According to the archaeologists <name type="pname">John Trav-<lb/>
los</name><ref target="#CH2-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> and <name type="pname">John Camp</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> at the end of the seventh cen-<lb/>
tury <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, on a flat basin of land in the Kerameikos&#x2014;the potters' quarter and cemetery district northwest of the Acropolis&#x2014;a nucleus of eastward-fac-<lb/>
ing public buildings began to take shape alongside the Panathenaic Way where it skirted the low hill of Kolo-<lb/>
nos (fig. 2.11). Although the Agora's boundaries were formally delimited by <hi rend="italic">horoi</hi>, boundary stones marking the points of entry of the streets feeding into it and underscoring its character as a quasi-sacred space, axial organization and symmetry played no role in the dispo-<lb/>
sition of structures around it. Conceived in piecemeal fashion, it suggested unity and coherence, but these characteristics came from a harmonious architectural design vocabulary, geometrically derived proportions, and similarity of building materials, rather than from an overall plan. Unlike the Roman forum, the Greek agora was not perceived by its builders as a self-contained space, but simply as the nexus of the urban organism.</p>
<p>Before the end of the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, when the Theater of Dionysus was built on the southeast slope of the Acropolis, the Agora served as an orches-<lb/>
tral space where singing, dancing, and plays were per-<lb/>
formed in front of spectators seated in wooden grandstands. After the transfer of athletic and theatrical events to the Acropolis slope, the open space of the Agora became the site of important commemorative monuments. One of the most important of these was the <hi rend="italic">Tyrannicides</hi>, a marble group by the fifth-century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> sculptors <name type="pname">Kritios</name> and <name type="pname">Nesiotes</name> depicting <name type="pname">Harmodios</name> and <name type="pname">Aristogeiton</name>, the heroes who killed <name type="pname">Hipparchos</name>, brother of the tyrant <name type="pname">Hippias</name>, at the end of the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> This work, a replacement for an earlier work by <name type="pname">Antenor</name> that was removed from the Agora in 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> when the <name type="pname">Persian king Xerxes</name> plundered <name type="place">Athens</name>, can be seen in a Roman copy in the National Archaeological Museum in Naples. It is an early repre-<lb/>
sentation of contemporary heroes and, as such, a prec-<lb/>
edent for the commemorative monuments of heroic individuals found in public squares and parks to this day (fig. 2.10).</p>

<p>On the north side of the Agora, facing the Panath-<lb/>
enaic Way as it led up to the Acropolis, the Stoa Poikile, or Painted Stoa, was built in the second quarter of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Its name derived from its function as an art gallery, its walls decorated with battle scenes painted by notable painters of the day. It was here, too, that bronze shields were taken to be displayed as tro-<lb/>
phies of war. The Stoa Poikile functioned as an import-<lb/>
ant meeting place, one frequented by street performers and beggars as well as philosophers. Followers of the philosopher <name type="pname">Zeno</name> (c. 335&#x2013;c. 263 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), who met his pupils in this <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi>, bequeathed to posterity the term <hi rend="italic">sto-<lb/>

<p>Herms&#x2014;figures we will meet in other landscape settings as garden ornaments&#x2014;were placed throughout <name type="place">Athens</name> at the entrances to private homes, shrines, and important public spaces including the Agora (fig. 2.12). At the northwest corner of the Agora, at the point where it was intersected by the Panathenaic Way, a large con-<lb/>
centration of these sculptures presided. A herm was a portrait bust of the god <name type="pname">Hermes</name> set upon a rectangular shaft from which protruded, halfway up, a representa-<lb/>
tion of male genitalia. As symbols of male potency, herms were popular figures. They were often placed as talismans in front of homes as well as in public places

<q><hi rend="bold">A</hi>round 520 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, the citizens built the Enneakrounos, a large public fountain house, the terminus of one of two recently constructed pipe-<lb/>
lines carrying water from the slopes of the Acropolis. With the drainage of the ground to the east and the construction of other public buildings on the remaining three sides of the open space thus formed, the Agora assumed the general size (10 acres) and irregular square shape that it maintained over several centuries.</q>
<q>Between 415 and 406 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, a new Bouleuterion was built adjacent to the old one. The Old Bouleuterion probably continued its function as the city archive, and the building became known as the Metroon. As such it was considered the sanctuary of <name type="pname">Rhea</name>, the Mother of the Olym-<lb/>
pian gods under whose auspices the civic records were guarded and the city's laws protected.</q>
<q>The Skias, or Tholos, stood immediately to the south of the New Bouleuterion and the Metroon. Its name denoted its round shape, like a <hi rend="italic">skias</hi>, or sun hat. Here the fifty <hi rend="italic">pryataneis</hi>, those senators who were functioning as the executive committee of the Boule, or Council, were served their meals. Approximately one-third of these remained on duty as guardians of the city, sleeping there throughout the night.</q>
<q>In the southwestern corner of the Agora, in front of some small buildings below the Tholos, was the 4th-century-<hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Monument of the Eponymous Heroes with ten bronze figuress flanked by ten bronze tri-<lb/>
pods (see 2.14). These represented each of the legendary figures selected by the Delphic Oracle as names for the ten "tribes" into which the people of Attica were divided. The tribes were created by the consti-<lb/>
tution drawn up by the statesman Cleisthenes at the end of the 6th cen-<lb/>
tury <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> In front of the monument was a barrier of stone posts and wooden railings. Here a citizen could read the civic notices posted beneath the figure representing his tribe. Here also general announce-<lb/>
ments, including drafts of proposed legislation, were posted. The Mon-<lb/>
ument of the Eponymous Heroes was thus an important information center in ancient <name type="place">Athens</name>, functioning much like the modern press in focusing debate on public issues.</q>
<q>At the northwest corner of the Agora stood the Royal Stoa (Stoa Basileios) where magistrates swore their oaths of office. Sets of thrones, which originally stood in front of the <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi>, attest to its function as a place of judicial review. Pottery fragments marked as the property of the state denote its use also as a site for official functions involving drinking and dining. It was to the Royal Stoa that <name type="pname">Socrates</name> was sum-<lb/>
moned in 399 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> to be indicted.</q>
<q>Directly to the south of the Royal Stoa was the larger Doric Stoa of <name type="pname">Zeus</name>, with two projecting wings and a fa&#x00E7;ade of Pentelic marble, believed to have been built between 430 and 420 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Sacred to the cult of <name type="pname">Zeus Eleutherios</name> (Freedom), the building was a monument to Greek freedom from Persian domination after 479 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Like the Painted Stoa, it served as a communal memorial and was adorned with paintings and trophies of war. Here <name type="pname">Socrates</name> conversed with his pupils.</q>
<q>Some of the paraphernalia associated with trial by jury, such as the small bronze axles, which served as ballots, have been discovered in and around the Agora. The exact location of the prison has not been confirmed; however, in the ruins of a building at the southwest corner of the Agora, archaeologists have found a cache of small clay medicine bottles, such as were used to dispense the executioner's dose of hem-<lb/>
lock, along with a small statuette of <name type="pname">Socrates</name> possibly left as a tribute.</q>
<q>On the south side of the Agora stood a long <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi>, built during the decade of 430&#x2013;420 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and replaced by another double-colonnaded <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi> in Hellenistic times. This structure housed the weights and mea-<lb/>
sures that ensured honesty in market transactions. Sixteen private meeting chambers behind the colonnade were furnished with dining couches. Nearby was the Mint, a building with the remains of a foundry where official items of bronze, such as the ballots of jurors and the weights and measures of commerce, were fabricated from the 4th cen-<lb/>
tury <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> on and where coins were struck in the third and second cen-<lb/>
turies <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Between the Mint and the South Stoa was the fountain house dating from the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi></q>
<pb n="73"/>
<pb n="73" type="orig"/>
and alongside important roads.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, trees were planted in the Agora to provide shade. These were probably plane trees and, like the trees planted at the same time at the Academy, they lined principal walkways and defined an outdoor class-<lb/>
room in which <name type="pname">Socrates</name> and other philosophers walked and talked with their students. Under one plane tree hung the notice board listing fines for women who had behaved in a disorderly manner. Later, beneath another, the Athenians placed a statue of the orator and statesman <name type="pname">Demosthenes</name> (384&#x2013;322 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>).</p>
<p>In the middle of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, <name type="pname">Pericles</name> focused the wealth garnered from <name type="place">Athens</name>'s hegemony within the Delian League upon the construction of the Parthenon and other temples on the Acropolis. During the last third of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, there was a burst of civic building activity around the Agora, so that, by the time the Athenian treasury was drained by Spartan victory at the end of the Peloponnesian Wars, its defining architecture had assumed the form that housed the city's important institutions throughout most of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi></p>
<p>Today, the Agora functions as an archaeological park enjoyed by tourists and city residents, and a careful replanting plan undertaken in the <date when="1950">1950</date>s using indigenous plant species common in ancient times provides an approximation of the welcome shade and greenery that this important public space had then. Now, as in antiquity, plants need irrigation to survive in the hot, dry Athenian climate, and the restored trees were planted along the same channels that orig-<lb/>
inally furnished water to the Agora. Cavities exca-<lb/>
vated in bedrock around three sides of the <name type="place">Temple of Hephaistos</name>, probably in the early third century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> when an aqueduct was built to carry water to this site next to the Agora, served as planting pockets for a tree-shaded promenade. These were replanted with myrtle and pomegranate during the horticultural res-<lb/>
toration.</p>

</figure>
<p>From literature, history, and archaeology, a por-<lb/>
trait of the life of the Agora emerges. To the ancient fountain house in its southeast corner came the women of the city bearing their amphoras. Nearby were the open-air market stalls where farmers sold livestock and produce. Beneath the colonnades of the various stoas a lively crowd mingled, gossiping or engaging in philosophical discussion and doing busi-<lb/>
ness of all kinds. At the Monument of the Eponymous Heroes, knots of men gathered to read the latest news (figs. 2.13, 2.14). Within the Bouleuterion complex, lawmakers attended to affairs of state. Courts of law, or a jury assembled outdoors, tried offenders. Upon occasion there would be functions of a sacro-civic nature with burnt offerings and contests performed before audiences seated in temporary grandstands. Among the many festival days of the year when the Agora was thronged with people celebrating or pass-<lb/>
ing through en route to one of the sacred sites inside or outside the city, none was more important than the Great Panathenaia, which occurred in the middle of summer every fourth year.</p>

<p>Of scarcely less importance than the Great Panathe-<lb/>
naia was the Great Dionysia, which took place annu-<lb/>
ally. In the beginning, celebrants honored Dionysus, patron god of drama and of this festival, in the Agora; later, the Athenians built a theater held sacred to him on the southeastern flank of the Acropolis. It con-<lb/>
tained a circular orchestra, 66 feet in diameter, with a floor of smooth-packed dirt and an altar in the center. Wooden planks set into the terraced hillside accom-<lb/>
modated the audience, and a modest wooden <hi rend="italic">skene</hi>, or scene building, provided the necessary theatrical backdrop.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Pericles</name>' fifth-century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> building program called for a new theater to accommodate the mature Greek drama that Aeschylus had pioneered in the Great Dionysias held in the 470s <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> In order to make room for a larger <hi rend="italic">skene</hi>, the theater was moved farther north to a position near the walls of the Acrop-<lb/>
olis. It is this theater, improved by the Athenian orator and financier <name type="pname">Lycurgus</name> in the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and extensively remodeled in Roman times, that tourists visit today. To the east of the theater, above the audi-<lb/>
torium, <name type="pname">Pericles</name> built a large square building called the Odeion to hold musical contests, which were also part of the Great Dionysia.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Kerameikos Cemetery</hi></hi></head>
<p>Just outside the Dipylon, or double gateway that formed the principal entrance to the city, lay the Ker-<lb/>
ameikos Cemetery. Burial at this site dates from the twelfth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, and archaeologists have dis-<lb/>
covered here enormous eighth-century-<hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> funerary kraters and amphorae decorated in the Geometric style. During the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, incised, painted, and bas-relief grave monuments, together with com-<lb/>
memorative sculpture, began to adorn the landscape. By this time the city walls had been built. Athenian law restricted burial to the outer Kerameikos beyond them, while the inner Kerameikos became the district where potters clustered to make the distinctive red-<lb/>
and-black Attic pottery that was one of the city's most important commercial wares, thus giving its name to ceramic production ever after.</p>
<p>Large-scale, carved stone versions of <hi rend="italic">lekythoi</hi>&#x2014;small, slender, ceramic urns&#x2014;became popular grave markers in the late fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> along with memorial altars, inscribed stelai, and sculptures of lions. Plots lining the Academy road, which was espe-<lb/>
cially scenic, became the final resting place of distin-<lb/>
guished statesmen and Athenians and their allies fallen in war. In this way a necropolis took shape, becoming, as we shall see in Chapter Nine, an aes-<lb/>
thetic inspiration for metropolitan suburban cemeter-<lb/>
ies in <name type="place">Paris</name>, <name type="place">Boston</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>, and other rapidly expanding cities of the industrial age. After the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, a law was issued forbidding costly sculptural works, and people honored the dead with simple round columns instead.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Athenian Countryside</hi></hi></head>
<p>The vital sum of all these activities indicates an extraordinary spirit of cultural unity during the centu-<lb/>
ries of Athenian self-governance. Moreover, even though <name type="place">Athens</name> was unique among Greek cities in the degree to which its religious life was focused inside the city, the connection between the city and its sur-<lb/>
rounding landscape was palpable and continuously experienced. To the northwest, the Sacred Way became the road to Eleusis, site of an important reli-<lb/>
gious sanctuary. To the northeast lay the road to <name type="place">Mount Pentelicus</name>, 10 miles distant, over which work-<lb/>
men hauled the thousands of tons of marble used to build the Parthenon and other important public build-<lb/>
ings. To the southeast, reinforcing the Parthenon's lineage as a temple of the goddess Athena, <name type="place">Mount Hymettos</name>, with its peak sanctuary to <name type="pname">Zeus Omvrios</name>, provoker of rain, reared its twin horns in axial rela-<lb/>
tionship to it. To the southwest lay Piraeus, connected to the city by parallel long walls protecting the transit of people and goods from the Spartan enemy. Between the road to Eleusis and the road to <name type="place">Thebes</name> in the north was the road upon which <name type="pname">Plato</name> journeyed as he went from the city to the nearby shady groves of the Acad-<lb/>
emy. The siting of the city thus, with mountains pro-<lb/>
tectively encircling three sides, while the fourth faced the sea&#x2014;a paradigm that was intuitively repeated by <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> elsewhere, notably in the plain of Argolis&#x2014;gave the Athenians a much clearer sense of specific territoriality than did their fortifying walls. <hi rend="italic">Polis</hi>_and <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> were an expression of both Mind (<hi rend="italic">Nous</hi>) and Nature, an integrated whole in which a profound ideal of human existence was made manifest.</p>
<p>In addition to developing an architectural vocabulary of columned, pedimented structures that has remained a living language for builders for more than two mil-<lb/>
lennia, the ancient Greeks enlarged the sense of urban life as a communal undertaking and created institu-<lb/>
tions such as the theater that expanded the human potential for self-awareness. Though their remarkable experiment in governance proved difficult to perpet-<lb/>
uate and replicate, some of their cultural and educa-<lb/>
tional institutions endured, and the language of Classical Greek architecture was expanded by Hellenistic and Roman architects.</p>
<p>With the Hellenistic Empire the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> as a self-governing civic and religious institution ceased to exist. In its place there arose a new cosmopolitan culture embracing the entire Mediterranean basin and
<pb n="75"/>
<pb n="75" type="orig"/>
extending as far east as <name type="place">Persia</name>. Within this far-flung region composed of many interactive urban centers, designers manipulated the forms inherited from <name type="place">Greece</name> in sophisticated ways, creating theatrical spatial compo-<lb/>
sitions that gave a new dynamism to landscape design paralleled by the dynamic movement and high degree of emotionalism Hellenistic sculptors gave to their figural compositions. By Roman times, the relationship of such architectural ensembles to natural settings no longer mattered as much as their employment to frame and con-<lb/>
tain space. Further, the replication of Roman civic forms was seen as a means of asserting authority and inspiring allegiance in colonial cities throughout an empire of even vaster dimensions than the one created by <name type="pname">Alexan-<lb/>
der the Great</name>.</p>

<p>Weakened by the long years of warfare with Sparta and assailed by other centers of growing power during the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, <name type="place">Athens</name> saw her hegemony among Aegean city states diminished and her own freedom threatened. Warfare was now a way of life throughout the Hellenic world, and although colonization was one solution to the problem of growing urban populations, within the context of the general Hellenic unrest, colo-<lb/>
nial outposts were vulnerable offshoots with an uncer-<lb/>
tain future.</p>
<p>It is a historical irony that <name type="place">Macedonia</name>, a land power without a significant navy, should have been the engine that propelled <name type="place">Greece</name> toward empire and the subjugation of <name type="place">Asia</name>. Following the murder of <name type="pname">Philip II</name> of <name type="place">Macedon</name> (382&#x2013;336 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), his brilliant son, <name type="pname">Alexan-<lb/>
der</name> (356&#x2013;323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), assumed the throne at the age of twenty. Already an experienced campaigner, he found the battlefield his natural home and soon set about com-<lb/>
pleting the Macedonian subjugation of <name type="place">Thessaly</name>, <name type="place">Thrace</name>, and <name type="place">Illyria</name>. After securing lands all the way to the Danube and beyond, he ruthlessly crushed rebel-<lb/>
lious <name type="place">Thebes</name>. The rest of the Greek city-states fell into line, including <name type="place">Athens</name>, co-conspirator of <name type="place">Thebes</name>, which <name type="pname">Alexander</name> could now afford to treat leniently.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Alexander the Great</name>'s thirteen-year reign was one of continued whirlwind conquest as his armies subdued the cities of <name type="place">Asia Minor</name>, <name type="place">Syria</name>, and <name type="place">Egypt</name>. With the eastern Mediterranean under his control, he marched into <name type="place">Mesopotamia</name> and, crossing the <name type="place">Cauca-<lb/>
sus</name>, on into <name type="place">India</name>. In the process of building an empire, he founded several cities, among them <name type="place">Alexandria</name> in <name type="place">Egypt</name>. Although his empire quickly fragmented fol-<lb/>
lowing his death in 323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, his great achievement was the creation of a Hellenistic culture and economy that stretched from Gibraltar to the <name type="place">Indus River</name>.</p>
<p>In this vast matrix, art and trade flourished, and the advances in geography, natural history, and other aspects of science that <name type="pname">Alexander</name> had encouraged con-<lb/>
tinued. In terms of art, <name type="pname">Alexander</name> had appropriated from his tutor <name type="pname">Aristotle</name> an ecumenical attitude, believ-<lb/>
ing the world to be an <hi rend="italic">oikumene</hi>, a place of eclectic exchange in which many cultures contributed form and style to the Greek base. Because of these circum-<lb/>
stances, the Greek heritage, now infused with a broad array of disparate cultural influences, was both dissem-<lb/>
inated and developed, acquiring certain important fea-<lb/>
tures that became basic ingredients of much subsequent landscape design. These included axial organization and a new monumentality, potent tools for dramatizing urban power and making the appearance of cities more symbolically expressive.</p>
<p>In the Hellenistic world, there was a heightened sense of the drama of human affairs. The serene ideal-<lb/>
ism of Classical Greek art was not compatible with the clamor of imperial armies. Power creates its own cul-<lb/>
tural imperatives: hagiography finds its counterpart in architectural monumentality and portraiture, while the tragedy of brutality and suffering often breeds melo-<lb/>
drama. Hellenism's broad sweep across continents was paralleled by an extravagant treatment of space. Build-<lb/>
ings were organized into elaborate complexes, and sculpture was no longer self-contained, but full of rest-<lb/>
less movement.</p>
<p>The vocabulary of design remained Classical, yet it was accented in new and theatrical ways. The manip-<lb/>
ulation of vertical space became an important aspect of landscape design as staircases and terraces took on new importance along with the organization of hori-<lb/>
zontal space through symmetry and axial alignment. Engaged columns, pilasters, and other means of sur-<lb/>
face articulation animated buildings and increased their dramatic presence. The prosperity engendered by trade and the continued growth and spread of popula-<lb/>
tions through colonization meant that many opportu-<lb/>
nities existed for experimentation with these elements of urban form.</p>

<p>The Hellenistic city appropriated the Hippodamian grid as a planning device and exploited it architectur-<lb/>

nexus open to all manner of through traffic and did not become a self-contained space segregated from its surrounding streets. Instead, it experienced a transformation akin to that of another important Hellenistic architectural form: the peristyle, or col-<lb/>

Their efforts resulted in an extraordinarily scenic compo-<lb/>

<q>A long terrace with two levels of buttressed retaining walls anchored the theater into its hillside. The colonnade run-<lb/>

<p>To understand more fully the forces at work as the Classical heritage of <name type="place">Greece</name> was transformed through Hellenistic culture into that of imperial <name type="place">Rome</name>, it is worth revisiting the Athenian Agora. Although <name type="place">Athens</name> did not offer the underlying orga-<lb/>
nizing principle of a grid plan, which would have facilitated the kind of articulation of public space as is found at Miletus, the agora in its Hellenistic and Roman incarnations nevertheless manifests the trend toward the regularization and inward-focusing of open space (fig. 2.21).</p>
<p>By the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, <name type="place">Athens</name> was a province of <name type="place">Rome</name>, a renowned center of learning, revered as the fountainhead of Greek culture and home to the most eminent philosophers of the day. <name type="pname">Cicero</name>, <name type="pname">Horace</name>, and <name type="pname">Ovid</name> came there to study, and various Roman emperors bestowed their largesse upon the city's venerable civic core in the form of new buildings. Not surprisingly, the Agora's charac-<lb/>
ter as a civic space changed; it lost all remaining identity as a place of democratic assembly and became instead a receptacle for Greco-Roman cul-<lb/>
ture and a repository of the glorious Classical past, which <name type="place">Rome</name> now appropriated.</p>
<p>The integrity of the original Agora space had been breached by the construction of the Hellenistic Middle Stoa, but this had been done to achieve a more regular spatial definition and accommodate the city's continued commercial vitality. Now there no longer existed any prohibition against encroachment upon the remaining space. Vividly illustrating the Athenian loss of governmental autonomy and the Agora's transfor-<lb/>
mation from civic core to cultural center was the con-<lb/>
struction of the Odeion in its center. This huge concert hall was probably built at the time of the emperor <name type="pname">Augustus</name>'s visit to the city between 16 and 14 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi></p>
<p>Symptomatic of the decline of Greek power, moreover, was the memorializing of its past. The Agora played a large role in this effort as it became a virtual museum of architectural reconstruction in an early attempt at "heritage theming." <name type="pname">Augustus</name>'s building program included the careful dismantling of the Temple of Ares, a marble structure of the Doric order that is believed to have stood several miles north of <name type="place">Athens</name> somewhere in the foothills of <name type="place">Mount Parnes</name>, and its reassembly in front of the Agora's western range of Classical and Hellenistic buildings. At this time, he had columns and other elements of neglec-ted fifth- and fourth-century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> buildings in the depopulated countryside of Attica transported to the Agora for conservation and reuse. From Sounion, from Thorikos, and from elsewhere came handsomely carved building parts, and from other places came small temples and altars. Inscriptions were carved on these, honoring the deified emperor <name type="pname">Agrippa</name>'s and his relatives.</p>
<p>In keeping with the continued exaltation of the Agora as a center of culture and learning, at the southeast corner along the Panathenaic Way, a pri-<lb/>
vate citizen, <name type="pname">Titus Flavius Pantaenus</name>, built a library at his expense in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> Like many Roman buildings, it was given the interior focus of a peristyle courtyard, while Greek-style stoas stood along three sides of the exterior (fig. 2.22).</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the Panathenaic Way, on the site of the old Mint and next to one of the recon-<lb/>
structed Classical temples, the Nymphaeum, a foun-<lb/>
<pb n="79"/>
<pb n="79" type="orig"/>
tain house in the shape of a large hemicycle, was built in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> The curving wall that rose above a series of basins, pools, and fountains seems to have been carved with niches for statues. This elabo-<lb/>
rate fountain was connected to the great aqueduct that carried water to <name type="place">Athens</name> from the Kephalari Springs on the lower slopes of <name type="place">Mount Pentelicus</name>. The construc-<lb/>
tion of the Athenian Nymphaeum illustrates the ancient Roman practice of celebrating an important public work through symbolic civic display. It was built in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> during the reign of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>, the emperor-architect who, more than all the others, identified with Greek culture and history. Besides the Nymphaeum, his legacy to the city included the monumental Temple of Olympian <name type="pname">Zeus</name>, a library, a gymnasium, a pantheon, and a shrine of Panhellenic <name type="pname">Zeus</name> and <name type="pname">Hera</name>.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Elements of Roman Urbanism</hi></hi></head>
<p>Order was the hallmark of Roman urbanism. In its most utilitarian dimension, Roman order meant <hi rend="italic">cen-<lb/>
turiation</hi>, the division of the territory surrounding a town into squares measuring 2400 feet (731.5 meters) per side. These <hi rend="italic">centuriae</hi> were so named because Roman surveyors subdivided them into approxi-<lb/>
mately one hundred oblong strips of land, arable fields for the most part, which were allocated as pri-<lb/>
vate property to the citizens of the town. A similarly utilitarian application of Roman order was to be found in the grid layout of military encampments that often served, as in the case of Florentia (Florence), as the future sites of colonial cities (fig. 2.23). The Roman grid, inherited from both Greek and Etruscan practice, was developed around a central cross axis, the street running north-south being the <hi rend="italic">cardo</hi>, and the east-<lb/>
west one traversing it being the <hi rend="italic">decumanus</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">insu-<lb/>
lae</hi>, or blocks formed by the subsidiary orthogonal streets, formed a checkerboard pattern of squares, rather than the oblong units familiar in Hellenistic grid planning. In many cases the <hi rend="italic">cardo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">decuma-<lb/>
nus</hi> forming the town center would be identical with the intersection of two survey lines of <hi rend="italic">centuriation;</hi> sometimes, however, a Roman town grid might respect the cardinal points of the compass in its orthogonal alignment while <hi rend="italic">centuriation</hi> proceeded&#x2014;as was the case with Florentia where the course of the Arno and the surrounding topography were taken into account&#x2014;in accordance with certain practical con-<lb/>
siderations.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a formula for the estab-<lb/>
lishment of a military settlement or a new town, Roman order prevailed in the predictable location of the forums and major civic structures of the town at the intersection of the <hi rend="italic">cardo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">decumanus</hi>. Further, planners subjugated all private building to a zoning code that decreed that no building could be higher than twice the width of the street upon which it stood, an ordinance that was sometimes breached as a town became overcrowded and people needed to erect tall tenements for housing. The manufacture of standard-<lb/>
ized, kiln-fired bricks, roof tiles, and drainage pipes in many sizes and shapes and the mass production of metal pipes and fastening devices, together with the invention of concrete and the necessary timber-form technology for repetitive pouring of vaults, walls, foundations, and other building parts, made possible the organization of a construction industry capable of operating with military-style efficiency. Indeed, many construction workers were soldiers of the Roman Empire.</p>

<figDesc>2.23. Aerial view of <name type="place">Florence</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name>. The original grid plan of Florentia, a Roman military encampment and colony, can be detected in the regular layout of the streets around the Piazza della Republica, the old Roman Forum.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>But there was a higher sense of order than that of the pragmatic grid honored by Roman urbanism, an order in which the grid played an ever-diminishing role until its use as a planning tool was virtually phased out in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> This order might be called imperial order, for it was a means of making manifest&#x2014;through planning and architecture em-ploying common urban spatial arrangements and building types&#x2014;the grandeur, beneficence, and ubiq-<lb/>
uity of empire. Throughout <name type="place">Asia Minor</name>, <name type="place">North Africa</name>, <name type="place">Iberia</name>, <name type="place">Great Britain</name>, <name type="place">Gaul</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name>, and all the islands of the <name type="place">Mediterranean</name>, a uniform building technology and urban planning mentality provided hundreds of vari-<lb/>
ants upon this theme. Imperial grandeur was be-stowed upon cities as great basilicas and public baths were built. High-based temples and triumphal
<pb n="80"/>
<pb n="80" type="orig"/>
arches added more scenographic verticality, and the-<lb/>
aters and amphitheaters provided both entertainment and landmark character. Paternalistically conceived, these Roman cities were designed through the machin-<lb/>
ery of imperial authority as livable habitats for their citizens. With running water, latrines, paved streets, and other amenities, they are the first cities in which modern urban dwellers could have felt at home. Col-<lb/>
lectively, along with the Roman roads and Roman aqueducts that served them, the cities proclaimed in physical terms the <hi rend="italic">Pax Romana</hi> across the broad sphere of empire. More than anything else, the repli-<lb/>
cation of this order over and over again throughout the Roman Empire's vast breadth manifested its wealth and the power of its highly centralized government.</p>
<p>What were the elements of the urban rhetoric that effectively and lastingly portrayed Roman imperial order? Although the grid was manipulated and even ignored, axiality itself was more firmly applied than ever before. Bilateral symmetry around strong axes governed the design of major public buildings and their attendant courts. The forum was a highly con-<lb/>
trolled space. Streets led to its entrances, but, unlike the Greek or Hellenistic agora, it was not traversed by thoroughfares. The Roman forum was thus at once integrated with, and separated from, the circulation system of the town, This street design, together with the firm architectural definition of borders, gave the forum&#x2014;like the great buildings that, with it, consti-<lb/>
tuted the civic core&#x2014;an inward focus.</p>
<p>Roman architecture and planning were in this way informed by profound space-shaping and place-fixing impulses. As cultural heirs of the Greeks, Romans sometimes paid homage to a local "genius of the place," but the cultural matrix in which they built was one grounded in an Aristotelian worldview and imperial politics. The sense of self-containment, enclosure, and embrace that their buildings and cities displayed denied integration with the greater land-<lb/>
scape and, instead, metaphorically proclaimed the values of the entire urbanized commonwealth. These building and urban forms, which were architecturally similar from place to place, were grounded not in their own locales, but rather in the concept of orderly impe-<lb/>
rial rule. It is thus understandable that the old shrines and sanctuaries in nature ceased to exert their pull, and communal processions to them stopped after the gods took up permanent residence in the cities. Roman tem-<lb/>
ples, like Roman basilicas, were for the most part found in or beside the forum, in the civic centers of towns.</p>
<p>Unlike the architecturally elaborate Hellenistic shrines at Lindos and Kos, which enjoyed a natural setting, the <name type="place">Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia</name>, begun in the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, was an urban shrine. Set into a hillside, it hovers above the town of <name type="place">Praeneste</name> (mod-<lb/>
ern <name type="place">Palestrina</name>) outside <name type="place">Rome</name>, offering a splendid example of the integration of site and architecture (fig. 2.24). It demonstrates, according to architectural his-<lb/>
torian <name type="pname">Spiro Kostoff</name>, "the cadenced climb in stages, with an artful use of landings, viewing points, and the alternating concealment and revelation of the terminal object, [that] was a special gift of Roman designers."<ref target="#CH2-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref> Behind the colonnades of its lower terraces were rows of shops. Lateral stairs ascend from the ground level to the first of seven terraces; to ascend from one ter-<lb/>
race level to the next, one is forced to return to the central axis. Here there are steep stairs or, in the case of the third and fourth terraces, long ramps, which climb from each side and then connect in the center above large barrel-vaulted niches that emphasize the central axis. Shops were placed behind porticoes that run the length of the fifth and sixth terraces on either side of the central stairs. The deep sixth terrace had side porticoes as well. The small semicircular top ter-<lb/>
race served as the orchestra for a theater and was therefore surrounded by stepped seating, above which stood as the climax to the whole soaring architectural composition a semicircular double portico and, rising behind it, a small round temple. The organization of the hillside into a series of terraces with stairs arranged to enforce axial movement and the resolution of axial thrust in a climactic semicircular embrace is consid-<lb/>
ered a source of inspiration for Bramante's Belvedere Court at the <name type="place">Vatican</name>, begun around <date when="1505">1505</date> (see Chapter Four, figs. 4.7, 4.8, 4.9), and subsequently through Bramante's example, the work of other Renaissance landscape designers.</p>

</figure>
<p>Most of the columns that once formed the col-<lb/>
onnades of the stepped facades and projecting wings of the <name type="place">Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia</name> have been removed, but the remaining structure bears witness to the Roman affinity for a construction technology and design vocabulary in which the arch played a dominant role. The arch has the ability to span dis-<lb/>
tances with balletic grace; its analogue is the leap, whereas that of the seriate column is the measured step. For this reason, the arcaded porticoes of Roman streets provide an altogether different visual rhythm from that set up by the Greek stoa or Hellenistic col-<lb/>
onnade. But, as is evident at <name type="place">Praeneste</name>, Roman apti-<lb/>
tude for arch construction did not mean forsaking the classical orders of Hellenistic architecture. On the contrary, columns and pediments were used exten-<lb/>
sively in both old and new ways as architects forged a specifically Roman architectural vocabulary. Peri-<lb/>
style courts increased in popularity, and colonnades were extensively employed to ennoble prominent thoroughfares. Most important, Roman designers applied columns and other sculptural elements deco-<lb/>
ratively to adorn and articulate the other-wise undif-<lb/>
ferentiated surfaces of freestanding arches as well as arched entrances and building fa&#x00E7;ades like that of the Colosseum in <name type="place">Rome</name>. The column-ornamented, free-<lb/>
standing triumphal arch erected to celebrate victory in battle became emblematic of <name type="place">Rome</name>, a familiar image appearing on coins and in other ways symbol-<lb/>
izing imperial rule (fig. 2.25).</p>
<p>These elements, which were often employed in conjunction with brick facing, constituted the archi-<lb/>
tectural ingredients of Roman urbanism. Cities throughout the empire established a well-defined and predictable sequencing of commonly established urban forms. The spatial linking of these according to certain conventional formulae, as well as the over-<lb/>
all familiarity of the forms themselves, gave the Roman urban landscape its essential character.</p>
<p>Principal thoroughfares were designed to visu-<lb/>
ally link these forms and spaces. They were differen-<lb/>
tiated from the byways of the town by their sunken grading, additional width, and an abundance of spe-<lb/>
cial features including fountains and, in important cities, freestanding arches and other architectural incidents such as nymphaeums. Sometimes colon-<lb/>
nades or arched porticoes extending for several blocks en-hanced the streets' status as principal ave-<lb/>
nues (fig. 2.26).</p>

<figDesc><hi rend="italic">Below:</hi> 2.28. Fountain, House of the Little Fountain, <name type="place">Pompeii</name>. 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> In order to enjoy the abundance of water available in the Imperial Age, Pompeians built showy mosaic fountains. These often took the form of a small pedimented structure containing a semicircular niche. Inside the niche, water cascaded down a miniature staircase or spouted from a jet held by, or contained within, a sculpture. The mosaics that decorated these fountains were formed of sea shells and brilliantly colored tiles.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>These aggrandized thoroughfares were often market streets, as they always led from a principal arched gate within the town wall to the central forum and were therefore arteries of traffic and foci of human activity. Because they were sunk slightly below the level of the buildings on either side, these streets formed curb-lined troughs. This facilitated the runoff of water and waste into drains like those that carry away rainwater and sewage in cities today. The street curbs also gave the roadbed linear definition, clearly marking its axial direction and imposing order upon the adjacent buildings. Although individ-<lb/>
ualistic in their interior planning, these buildings almost invariably respected a uniform building line parallel to the street. Raised blocks at intersections facilitated pedestrian crossing (fig. 2.27).</p>
<p>The forum, normally at the nexus of the town's principal thoroughfares, might lie astride the street crossing. If that was the case, its sense of spatial enclosure would nevertheless be carefully main-<lb/>
tained by its embracing porticoed architecture and the careful articulation of its entry points. More often, the forum lay beside a principal thoroughfare within the arms of one of the angles formed by the major crossing, its entrance prominently marked by archi-<lb/>
tectural elements. Like the principal thoroughfares, it received special emphasis by being sunk slightly below the surrounding grade, with its edges outlined by a few shallow steps. Because the entrance portico was above the grade of the street, passage into the forum was marked by going first up, and then down, one or more stairs.</p>
<p>With great sophistication, urban planners employed steep flights of stairs within Roman cities to negotiate topographic changes in grade and to ascend the platforms on which Romans set their tem-<lb/>
ples, basilicas, and other monumental structures. In addition to offering formal variety, these stairs and ramps gave a degree of vertical drama. Some flights of stairs rose straight, others laterally from the ends of buildings, still others from the flanks of an axial element. In certain instances where there were sev-<lb/>
eral levels, these different methods of ascent were em-ployed in combination, as at <name type="place">Praeneste</name>. Steps could, of course, be used as seats and probably served, as they often do today, as places for informal gathering.</p>
<p>Noncommercial public space was plentiful in Roman cities. It was one of the hallmarks of imperial urbanism, and its daily use in a variety of instructive and pleasurable ways was a happy perquisite of Roman citizenship. As an institution of Roman life and as a statement of imperial largesse, the monu-<lb/>
mental public baths were important elements in the social fabric of cities. Their high, vaulted, axially planned and beautifully decorated interiors con-<lb/>
tained&#x2014;in addition to hot, warm, and cold bathing rooms&#x2014;well-stocked libraries. In addition to offer-<lb/>
ing sensory, mental, and social stimulation, they were centers of physical fitness. Adjacent gardens and palaestrae for exercising were often planned as axi-<lb/>
ally connected peristyle courts. The fusion of the gymnasium and the heated bath manifested the sophisticated cosmopolitanism of imperial times. When not erected by emperors as a means of demon-<lb/>
strating beneficence and gaining public approval, they were built by wealthy patrons. Many Roman baths are early examples of civic philanthropy and bear inscriptions recognizing the donor.</p>
<p>Although as populations grew and apartment dwellings replaced individual residences within <name type="place">Rome</name> itself and in many other Roman cities, these structures did not make cities feel overcrowded or
<pb n="83"/>
<pb n="83" type="orig"/>
disagreeable. There was abundant public space, aque-<lb/>
duct-fed fountains and baths, and a sophisticated infra-<lb/>
structure for sewage disposal. Moreover, cities were beautified with sculptures and ornament. Roman archi-<lb/>
tects became increasingly confident in the handling of light. Polished marble and glittering mosaics reflected light. Light also animated the surface of water. The con-<lb/>
tinual motion and sound of water splashing in fountains and pools and gliding over water stairs set within the niches of <hi rend="italic">nymphaeums</hi> added another important sensory dimension to imperial Roman cities (fig. 2.28). Patterns of light and shade&#x2014;no longer legible because today col-<lb/>
onnades and porticoes are bare, unroofed archaeological ruins&#x2014;were also an important part of the sensory expe-<lb/>
rience of street and plaza.</p>

<p>This growing design sophistication is apparent not only in the remains of Roman public buildings and public spaces, but also in the decoration and landscaping of the Roman homes and gardens unearthed by archaeologists. At <name type="place">Pompeii</name> and <name type="place">Herculaneum</name>, the houses of a prosperous merchant class reveal many fine wall paintings and the remains of once-beautiful gardens. The Hellenistic peri-<lb/>
style court provided the design prototype for these peri-<lb/>
style gardens, but whereas the former was surfaced with beaten earth or paving stones, the latter were lush with vegetation (fig. 2.29).</p>
<p>During the Roman imperial period, beginning with the reign of <name type="pname">Augustus</name> in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, the con-<lb/>
struction of an aqueduct had an important effect on the standard of living in <name type="place">Campania</name>, the land on the slopes of <name type="place">Mount Vesuvius</name>. An ample water supply made possible the construction of large public baths as well as curbside fountains on the major streets of its cities, and pools and large gardens at its villas. Irrigation benefited the flower and perfume industry of <name type="place">Pompeii</name> and allowed the plant-<lb/>
ing of greater numbers of perennials and shrubs in gar-<lb/>
dens than heretofore, since these need more frequent watering than do deep-rooted trees (fig. 2.30). The small villa on the Via dell'Abbondanza, formerly referred to as the House of Loreius Tiburtinus and more recently as the House of Octavius Quartio, provides an example of a

bly a <hi rend="italic">triclinium</hi>. This footbridge faces a small temple surmounting a <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi> <hi rend="bold">D</hi> and connects the terrace with the gar-<lb/>
den. Jets of water poured from the stepped base of the temple onto an apron of random-cut paving stones in front of this footbridge, before draining into the <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi> below. At the west end of the terrace there was a <hi rend="italic">zoothecula</hi> <hi rend="bold">A</hi>, a pleas-<lb/>
ant retiring room where sated diners could nap or relax while looking back across the <hi rend="italic">euripus</hi> and the landscaped terrace.</q>
<q>Below the temple, water spilled down three steps and flowed into another <hi rend="italic">euri-<lb/>
pus</hi> <hi rend="bold">E</hi> perpendicular to the one along the terrace and extending the entire length of the garden (see fig. 2.31). This stream is punctuated by a pergola-shaded pool con-<lb/>
taining an elaborate <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi>-fountain <hi rend="bold">F</hi> designed to make the water falling into the pool <hi rend="bold">E</hi> below ripple and shimmer. Far-<lb/>
ther along the <hi rend="italic">euripus</hi> there is a second, smaller, temple <hi rend="bold">G</hi>, the optical effect of which, when viewed from in front of the first, is to increase the impression of the garden's size.

Pompeian garden organized around a series of pools and fountains (figs. 2.31, 2.32).</p>
<p>Wall paintings and mosaics expressed the ancient Roman's love of nature. Few houses, even outside the apartment-filled metropolis, had extensive gardens like that of the one on the Via dell'Abbondanza, and <hi rend="italic">trompe-l'oeil</hi> paintings of garden scenery were fre-<lb/>
quently used to extend the illusion of garden space. Though weather and the bombing of several Italian cities during World War II have taken a severe toll on many of these fragile frescoes, a number of tantalizing fragments remain. They show how in some cases an axial view from the atrium into the peristyle garden was prolonged by <hi rend="italic">trompe-l'oeil</hi>_paintings on a rear wall. Attached columns framing these delightful gar-<lb/>
den scenes made them appear to be natural views seen from a portico. The well-known fresco from the Villa of Livia at suburban <name type="place">Prima Porta</name> was painted as a con-<lb/>
tinuous mural on the four walls of a sunken chamber built as a retreat from the summer heat (fig. 2.33). Here an illusory garden, painted against an azure back-<lb/>
ground, evokes the shrubs, flowers, fountains, birds, and white-painted lattice fencing found in actual Roman gardens of the period.</p>
<p>Garden paintings often decorated small court-<lb/>
yards and light wells. In addition to these straightfor-<lb/>
ward representations of fountains, flora, and fauna, two other illusionistic subjects&#x2014;the sacro-idyllic landscape and the villa landscape&#x2014;were painted on the walls of Roman houses. The Roman architect and engineer <name type="pname">Vitruvius</name> (active 46&#x2013;30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) writes of the "images of the gods, or the representations of legends" contained in sacro-idyllic paintings, that is, paintings of gods and other figures in an empyrean landscape. Somewhat more realistic, but closely related in spirit were paintings of villas and porticoes set within a land-<lb/>
scape depicting "harbors, headlands, shores, rivers, springs, straits, temples, groves, hills, cattle, shep-<lb/>
herds."<ref target="#CH2-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> These frequently contained figures engaged in rural pursuits such as fishing and hunting. A painting of this type is found on the south wall of the garden in the House of the Little Fountain at <name type="place">Pompeii</name> (fig. 2.34).</p>

<p>From all this, we can see how, using a standardized architectural vocabulary, Roman builders composed their urban designs in predictable yet highly satisfying ways. The pleasing recombination of conventional geometric forms; the shaping of space around ritual activities and the concomitant use of axial composition and symmetry to enforce notions of order, stability, and place; a love of illusion and theatrical effects; and a sensory approach to physical comfort and aesthetic delight were the attributes of Roman urban design. Through <hi rend="italic">centuriation</hi>, significant portions of nature had become firmly subjugated to Roman order, and now domesticated landscape was to be found within the peristyle garden as well as in the surrounding countryside. We can expect to find these same princi-<lb/>
ples and practices in Roman villas of the Age of <name type="pname">Augustus</name> (27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>&#x2014;14 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) and during the reigns of the emperors who succeeded him.</p>

<p>The ideal of a second home in the country, a retreat for what the Romans called <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>&#x2014;a kind of industrious leisure comprised of worthwhile mental and physical pursuits away from the distractions of urban business, politics, and society&#x2014;has exerted a strong appeal in various cultures throughout history. While writers from Horace to <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name> extolled rural val-<lb/>
ues and the wholesome simplicity of rural life, their lives in the country did not require them to engage in rustic toil. Much as they admired the farmer, their affluence and broad intellectual horizons enabled them to adopt an aesthetic attitude different from that of the plowman with his hard daily labors performed under the hot sun.</p>
<p>Like the term <hi rend="italic">country house</hi>, the word <hi rend="italic">villa</hi> stands for a social ideal as well as an architectural form, connoting a vision of the good life, a life free of sordid care and pecuniary want. But in Republican times and also for those Romans who, like Virgil, romantically yearned for the imagined goodness and simplicity of a pre-Imperial age, the chief purpose of villa life was fruitful husbandry. The <hi rend="italic">villa rustica</hi> is the earliest villa form, ideologically supported by Roman poets, including Virgil, who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>, his great pastoral poem, and the <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi>, a poetic treatise on agriculture, in the second half of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> For Virgil, the <hi rend="italic">villa rustica</hi> con-<lb/>
noted a Golden Age of peace and plenty, and in extolling the virtues of agrarian life, he promoted a kind of Jeffersonian ideal of the independent farmer whose industry can bring a return to simple ancient values.</p>
<p>This idealistic vision, however, did not match economic and social reality. Many small farmers never returned to the land after being driven away during the Punic Wars in the third and second centu-<lb/>
ries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> Pillaging armies and the competition of slave labor and cheap imported produce caused the collapse of the old agrarian way of life. The process was completed during the years of civil strife that occurred in the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> when victorious partisans confiscated the properties of the defeated. At the same time, landowners converted land from the cultivation of grain and other crops for domestic con-<lb/>
sumption to ranches for cattle and sheep grazing and to plantations for wine and oil production.</p>
<p>The owners of these <hi rend="italic">latifundia</hi>, or large rural establishments, were for the most part city-bred, oper-<lb/>
ating their landholdings for profit with slave labor. If the proprietor was in residence for part of the year, as was often the case, he built for his use a house similar to the ones found at <name type="place">Pompeii</name> and Herculaneum. Because in plan it followed the form of city houses, it was classified a <hi rend="italic">villa urbana</hi>, to distinguish it from the <hi rend="italic">villa rustica</hi>. The two were, nevertheless, usually merged into a single block that was easier to fortify and defend than widely separated structures would have been. Security and practicality, as opposed to aesthetics, thus dominated the architectural character of such country villas as the one in <name type="place">Boscoreale</name> near <name type="place">Pompeii</name>, dating from the beginning of the first cen-<lb/>
tury <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, where wine pressing and storage facilities, together with barns and stables, were united within the same walls as a commodious house for the proprietor (fig. 2.35).</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-79">
<graphic url="CH2_037.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>A third villa type, the <hi rend="italic">villa suburbana</hi>, was, as its name implies, one located on the outskirts of the city. In addition, there was the <hi rend="italic">villa marittima</hi>, the seaside villa that became a popular pleasure resort for wealthy Romans in the Imperial Age. The entire area around the <name type="place">Bay of Naples</name> was ringed with the kind of porti-<lb/>
coed seaside villas seen in landscape paintings of the period (fig. 2.36).</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Pliny's Villas</hi></hi></head>
<p>To understand better the villa as a building type during these times of Roman power and prosperity, genera-<lb/>
tions of architectural historians have turned to the let-<lb/>
ters of Pliny the Younger, a wealthy landowner in the
<pb n="87"/>
<pb n="87" type="orig"/>
first century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> Pliny was the owner of both a <hi rend="italic">villa marittima</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">villa urbana</hi>. Although <name type="pname">Laurentinum</name>, his maritime villa, was only seventeen miles outside of <name type="place">Rome</name> at <name type="pname">Vicus Augustanus</name>, it offered the same kind of opulent and luxurious life many other members of the Roman aristocracy enjoyed along the beautiful Cam-<lb/>
panian shore around Naples. In his letter regarding it, he describes its axial sequence of rooms, framed by views of the sea on one end and mountains on the other:
<q>There is an atrium at the entrance, simple but not drab, then a <hi rend="italic">porticus</hi> in the shape of the letter "D" which surrounds a small but cheerful court. This makes a fine retreat in bad weather, being pro-<lb/>
tected by windows and still more by the over-<lb/>
hanging roof. Opposite the center is the cheerful <hi rend="italic">cavaedium</hi>, and then a rather lovely <hi rend="italic">triclinium</hi>, which runs out toward the shore and, when the sea is whipped up by the southwest wind, is lightly washed by the breaking waves. It has folding doors and windows of equal width so that on the sides and front it seems to command, as it were, three seas. At the rear it looks back through the <hi rend="italic">cavaedium</hi>, with its colonnade, the portico behind, and the atrium onto the woods and dis-<lb/>
tant mountains.<ref target="#CH2-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<figure xml:id="fig-80">

<figDesc>2.36. Fresco painting of a harbor with seaside villas, from <name type="place">Stabiae</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>In addition, this luxurious retreat had a series of steam-heated bedrooms off the large dining room where one could retire for a nap after dinner. There were also a gymnasium, two steam rooms, hot and cold baths, a large swimming pool overlooking the sea, and a ball court. In a separate part of the villa, a towered suite contained another dining room with a view of the shoreline and other villas to the north, as well as several more heated bedrooms, presumably for guests. Many windows overlooked a terrace garden on the seaward side, and perhaps half as many opposite faced a flower and vegetable garden. Pliny's own favorite spot at this villa was the <hi rend="italic">heliocaminus</hi>, a small heated sunroom where, even on a winter day, he could sunbathe. Adjacent to this amenity was a small suite of private rooms to which he could retire and enjoy the spectacular view in all directions.</p>
<p>Like wealthy people who today have vacation homes both at the beach and in the mountains, Pliny had, in addition to <name type="pname">Laurentinum</name>, <name type="pname">Tusci</name>, a villa in Tus-<lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
<pb n="88" type="orig"/>
cany on the southern slopes of the Apennines overlook-<lb/>
ing the Tiber. It was to this <hi rend="italic">villa urbana</hi> that he went in the summer to study and write and, with the labor of slaves, to tend his vineyards and other crops. Here he could gaze at an "immense amphitheatre which only nature could create." There, as he described it:
<q>The broad plain is ringed by mountains on the crown of which are ancient stands of tall trees, and various kinds of hunting may be found there. &#x2026; It is a voluptuous experience to look down on this scene from the mountain. You seem to be seeing not real land but rather a painted scene of exceptional beauty, and wherever the eye turns it is refreshed by its variety and precision.<ref target="#CH2-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>In this spectacular landscape, Pliny created a set-<lb/>
ting of elegance and luxury akin to that of his seaside villa. There were baths with pools of varying tempera-<lb/>
tures, comfortable bedrooms, dining suites, peristyle gardens, and promenades. In addition, there was a large hippodrome-shaped garden filled with evergreen and deciduous trees, including various kinds of fruit trees and boxwood topiary in all manner of shapes, probably including the owner's monogram, a popular practice in Pliny's day. In his letter describing his Tusci villa, Pliny mentions other features of this garden: obe-<lb/>
lisks, roses, and green lawns as well as a central section designed to imitate wild nature. At the curved end of the "hippodrome," there was a <hi rend="italic">stibadium</hi>, or semicir-<lb/>
cular dining couch with water flowing beneath it. It faced a small pool that served as a basin upon which servants floated dishes toward Pliny and his guests. Behind this arrangement stood a pavilion with a foun-<lb/>
tain in the center and an alcove bedroom. This one, open to the garden, was entirely faced with marble. It must have been pleasant to lie there in the filtered green light listening to the sounds of birds and the mur-<lb/>
murous waters of the fountain.</p>

<p>Several architects and historians have given graphic representation to Pliny's descriptions of his two villas, but the archaeological remains have not been identi-<lb/>
fied. At the archaeological site of <name type="place">Oplontis</name>, near <name type="place">Her-<lb/>
culaneum</name> on the slopes of <name type="place">Mount Vesuvius</name>, however, one can visit an excavated villa near the coast of Cam-<lb/>
pania that was built and remodeled between the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and the eruption of 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> (fig. 2.37). The villa may once have been owned by the emperor <name type="pname">Nero</name>'s second wife Poppaea Sabina, hence its name, the Villa of Poppaea.</p>
<p>At one end, a monumental pedimented door over-<lb/>
looks a large exterior ornamental garden. Root cavities in the garden reveal hedges, likely of box. Four <hi rend="italic">herms</hi> were placed among plants, probably oleanders. There were, in addition, four sculptural fountains in the shape of centaurs. The villa also has an east wing in which were located four small interior gardens. The apparent size of these charming gardens was increased by wall paintings of vines, fountains, flowers, and birds (fig. 2.38).</p>
<p>Another attractive garden lies to the south of a large swimming pool measuring 56 feet in width and,
<pb n="89"/>
<pb n="89" type="orig"/>
according to excavations to date, 165 feet in length (17 meters wide and more than 50 meters long). This gar-<lb/>
den could be enjoyed through the open windows of a <hi rend="italic">diaeta</hi>, or livingroom, here designed specifically for enjoying framed views of horticultural or natural land-<lb/>
scape vistas. To the east of the swimming pool, and a few feet below it, thirteen statuary bases have been discovered in a garden of uncertain extent. Root casts prove that some of the trees in this garden were lemon trees.</p>
<p>The Villa of Poppaea at <name type="place">Oplontis</name>, like Pliny's Laurentinum and Tusci, shows that, by the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, the villa was less important as an agricultural establishment and instead was used increasingly as a place for <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>, or refined leisure. In its extensive use of colonnaded porticoes on the outside and its opening of axes to embrace wide vistas beyond the villa itself, it demonstrates the same strong aesthetic appreciation of nature found in Pliny's letters.</p>
<p>Not far from <name type="place">Oplontis</name>, still buried beneath the hard volcanic ash that covered Herculaneum and nearby parts of the Campanian plain, is the Villa of the Papyri, named for the more than two thousand charred scrolls that were discovered in <date when="1754">1754</date> in one part of its library. <name type="pname">J. Paul Getty</name> built his museum in <name type="place">Malibu</name>, <name type="place">Cal-<lb/>
ifornia</name>, in the early <date when="1970">1970</date>s using the plan drawn by <name type="pname">Karl Weber</name>, a Swiss engineer who oversaw the systematic excavation of the villa's rooms during the eighteenth century. For students of ancient gardens, this original Getty Museum provides an instructive modern replica of ancient villa design and gives one a feeling for the colorful ostentation of floors, walls, and ceilings of such villas before time and catastrophe took their toll. There is an inner peristyle garden modeled after the one built in the first phase of the villa's construction during the second century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, as well as a much larger peristyle garden that copies the one added in the following century. Within the latter, set within the box-<lb/>
wood compartments surrounding a 218-foot- (66.5-<lb/>
meter-) long pool, are replicas of many of the statues that Weber found.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Grotto of Tiberius</hi></hi></head>
<p>Unfortunately for posterity, there are few other remains from the great villa-building period of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, when the economic prosperity and security of the empire made this kind of construction possible. How-<lb/>
ever, one such villa, a fascinating combination of water, sculpture, and outdoor entertaining, has come to light in recent years: the so-called Grotto of Tiberius at <name type="place">Sperlonga</name> along the Via Flacca, the shore road between Terracina and Gaeta, famous for its villas. Uncovered around <date when="1960">1960</date> during the course of highway construc-<lb/>
tion, the villa, which incorporates into its plan a natural seaside cave, provides a provocative glimpse of the pleasures enjoyed by wealthy Romans in imperial times.</p>
<p>It is also a testament to the fact that by this period the grotto's function as a holy place was only a dim legacy from the days when people made pilgrimages to cave sanctuaries to worship in nature. Sophisticated Romans now preferred to treat landscape in terms of a poetic and theatrical ideal. Why should not a real grotto serve as the setting for the enactment in sculpture of a favorite Homeric tale, <name type="pname">Odysseus</name>'s visit to the cave of the one-eyed giant Polyphemus?</p>
<p><name type="pname">Odysseus</name> and his men, imprisoned by the Cyclops in his cave, saved themselves by ramming a sharpened stake into the drunken monster's single eye. This part of the <name type="pname">Odysseus</name> legend formed the theme of an elabo-<lb/>
rate decoration of the <name type="place">Sperlonga</name> grotto, whose builder is assumed, on the basis of a fragmentary inscription, to have been one Faustinus, a landowner and friend of the poet Martial who lived in the second half of the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> The cave and its adjacent <hi rend="italic">villa marittima</hi> are close to the scarred cliff face where, according to the Roman historians <name type="pname">Tacitus</name> and <name type="pname">Suetonius</name>, a huge chunk of rock overhanging the entrance to the cave sud-<lb/>
denly broke off and fell during a banquet, endangering the life of Tiberius (ruled 14&#x2013;37 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) and thereby con-<lb/>
ferring on posterity the association of this emperor's name with the grotto.</p>
<p>The grotto at <name type="place">Sperlonga</name> is a purposeful extension of Hellenistic theatricality through a dramatic combi-<lb/>
nation of landscape, architecture, and sculpture. The cave, hollowed from the cliff by wave action, has been extended architecturally into the landscape (fig. 2.39). Its mouth formerly originated on a spur of the rocky cliff into which was set a huge Hellenistic sculptural
<pb n="90"/>
<pb n="90" type="orig"/>
composition depicting <name type="pname">Odysseus</name>'s ship trying to pass through the Strait of Messina, where the sea monster Scylla lay in wait to ensnare travelers in its snakelike coils. This work and others from the grotto have been attributed to <name type="pname">Agesander</name>, <name type="pname">Athenodorus</name>, and <name type="pname">Polydorus</name>, the three Rhodian sculptors who are believed to have created <hi rend="italic"><name type="pname">Laoc&#x00F6;on</name> and His Sons</hi>, that famous work of Hellenistic sculpture now in the Museo Pio Clemen-<lb/>
tino, one of the <name type="place">Vatican</name> museums. Stylistically, there is certainly a resemblance in the forceful bodies, vio-<lb/>
lent movement, and anguished expressions character-<lb/>
istic of these pieces. But whereas the <hi rend="italic"><name type="pname">Laoc&#x00F6;on</name></hi> group is nearly intact, the Polyphemus sculptures were badly smashed by zealous Christians when they erected a medieval church on the site. A small museum now houses some of their fragments and several small, charming late Hellenistic sculptures of children that may have decorated the sides of fountains and pools (fig. 2.40).</p>

<p>Since the sixteenth century, tourists, artists, architects, and archaeologists have been fascinated by the spec-<lb/>
tral ruins of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa. Set where the hilly slopes and precipitous gorges cut by the river Aniene, the principal tributary of the Tiber, meet the rolling Cam-<lb/>
pagna plain below the town of <name type="place">Tivoli</name> (Tibur in Roman times), <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa is estimated to have been approximately 300 acres (120 hectares), or slightly
<pb n="91"/>
<pb n="91" type="orig"/>
more than one-third the size of <name type="place">New York City's Cen-<lb/>
tral Park</name>. This sprawling complex of broken vaults, collapsed domes, crumbling mosaic pavements, and fractured columns, covers an undulating terrain defined by two valleys with a southeast-northwest orientation. It was built between 118 and 138 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, the year of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s death. Although he was abroad for several extended periods during its construction (a philhellene, he spent the winters of 124/125 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> and 131/132 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> in <name type="place">Athens</name>), it may be assumed that <name type="pname">Hadrian</name> often thought about the project as he com-<lb/>
missioned copies of ancient sculptures from Greek artists or corresponded with his architects on various aspects of the villa's design.</p>
<p>In plan and scale it suggests something far grander than the usual villa (fig. 2.42). The ruins are those of large banqueting halls and gardens, theaters and baths, grottoes and pools, private apartments, and quarters for many servants and guests. <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa has sometimes been compared with <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century gardens at <name type="place">Versailles</name>. Similarities include the grandeur and scale of each project, both rulers' desire for a court setting away from the capital, and their personal involvement in the design process. Both used the landscape as a lavish entertainment site and as a means of advertising the richness and depth of their respective cultures. There is, however, a nota-<lb/>
ble design difference. Hierarchical axes order the composition of the gardens of <name type="place">Versailles</name>; <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa, on the other hand, has no principal organizing axis, but rather a series of independent ones that sometimes collide obliquely. Its general plan com-<lb/>
prises several independently organized building and garden complexes, each of which embodies the Aris-<lb/>
totelian notion of place&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">topos</hi>&#x2014;as defined and contained space. To infer that <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa is sim-<lb/>
ply a series of discrete <hi rend="italic">topoi</hi> and had no overall plan, however, is erroneous. Extensive terracing and a complex infrastructure of underground service routes extending over a large portion of the site indicate a comprehensive vision from the start.</p>
<p>Though heavily ransacked for building materi-<lb/>
als in the Middle Ages and robbed by Renaissance popes and connoisseurs of much of its opulent deco-<lb/>
ration of carved marble, gilded bronze, and ornamen-<lb/>
tal fountains, the villa is nonetheless a text that, with the assistance of recent scholarship, can be read as the summation of imperial Roman architectural expres-<lb/>
sion.<ref target="#CH2-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> More than that, it can be understood as a bril-<lb/>
liant essay in Greco-Roman bonding, for <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>, as we have seen, greatly admired Greek culture and was responsible for the civic revival of <name type="place">Athens</name>.</p>
<p>Although it pays tribute to the greatness of the Classical past, the villa was for <name type="pname">Hadrian</name> a laboratory of architectural innovation. He had the educated eye of a well-traveled connoisseur and oversaw with great particularity the designs he commissioned. Like a present-day theme park, it was eclectically pro-<lb/>
grammed. But unlike a theme park, which is designed to nourish the fantasies of popular culture, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa was the product of intense personal passion and extensive scholarship. It was a vast and glittering pri-<lb/>
vate landscape of allusion filled with indirect refer-<lb/>
ences to other places and events in the panoramic sweep of empire as well as to the gods, goddesses, and heroes of the Greco-Roman pantheon. Because the emperor was under no constraint to conform to normative building conventions and was therefore able to push Roman design idioms to expressive heights, the villa should be read as his personal build-<lb/>
ing project, one in which his taste and decisions gov-<lb/>
erned even minute details of decoration as well as creative new spatial volumetrics.</p>
<p>Like his predecessor, <name type="pname">Nero</name>, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name> disliked the old imperial palaces on <name type="place">Rome</name>'s <name type="place">Palatine Hill</name>. But whereas <name type="pname">Nero</name> had tried to build his fabulous <name type="place">Domus Aurea</name>, or <name type="place">Golden House</name>, in the center of <name type="place">Rome</name>, caus-<lb/>
ing the populace to revolt because of his indiscrimi-<lb/>
nate expropriations of property, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name> chose to carry on his immense building project away from the public eye. Seventeen miles east of <name type="place">Rome</name>, <name type="place">Tivoli</name> was already populated with the kind of aristocratic villas described by Pliny. Most of these were located on the hilly slopes overlooking the Campagna plain, where the Aniene cut a steep gorge and dropped in a dra-<lb/>
matic waterfall.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Hadrian</name> did not, as might have been expected, choose a site for the villa on the wooded heights of <name type="place">Tivoli</name>. Rather, he located it on the flat land 2&#x00BD; miles below the town. This choice, less cool and less inher-<lb/>
ently scenic than such sites as that of the steeply pitched Renaissance Villa d'Este in the heart of <name type="place">Tivoli</name>, can be explained by the fact that the finest land above was already occupied and a prior villa in the lower location may have been the property of <name type="pname">Hadri-<lb/>
an</name>'s wife, <name type="pname">Sabina</name>. The location may also be explained by the ease with which water could be furnished in copious amounts from one of the four aqueducts tra-<lb/>
versing this region en route to metropolitan <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>
<p>More than a country retreat, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s villa is a thematic summation of the philhellenic emperor's meditation upon the vast, rich, mature civilization over which he ruled. A feat of Roman engineering requiring monumental earth-moving, terracing, and the laying of water lines and other necessary elements of infrastructure, the villa admirably served <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s objective: to create a park that was its own allusive, experiential place of history and cultural memory, an idealized statement of the Greco-Roman heritage. He achieved this through a series of loosely linked archi-<lb/>

Sculptures placed between columns and pergolas lined the long sides of this canal set within a draw with steep terraced embankments. Its axis was terminated in the large half-dome at the southeast end. This impressive structure, its interior wall once encrusted with mosaic and undulating in a series of alternating radial gores, served as the backdrop for a <hi rend="italic">stibadium</hi>, a semicircular dining couch (fig. 2.43). This <hi rend="italic">stibadium</hi> was rimmed with water, and circular sockets near its base held bronze serving tables.

tectural "events" in which experience was heightened by sequential discovery. These consisted of a number of centrally focused landscapes framed by spatially complex monumental architecture, such as that of the Scenic Canal and Triclinium, often called the Cano-<lb/>
pus,<ref target="#CH2-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> a long, partially colonnaded canal terminated by a large hooded vault near the Vestibule, or main entrance hall, which served as a dramatic banqueting setting (figs. 2.45, 2.46). No certain assignment of function has been made for the Island Enclosure, a canal-and-column-encircled space of ingenious design that for many years bore the conventional label "Marine Theater," but its ornamentation, like that of the Canopus, was planned according to a program of allusion that exemplified cosmopolitan Roman culture and its Greek antecedents (fig. 2.44). While serving this thematic end, the villa was also the equivalent of a contemporary spa hotel. There were exercise facili-<lb/>
ties for both staff and guests, and two baths, similar in design to Roman metropolitan ones with their sequence of hot, warm, and cold pools and rooms for oiling and massage.</p>
<p>Many of the connective elements that knit these parts into a comprehensive framework&#x2014;colonnades, pergolas, paths, and planting&#x2014;can only be guessed at today. A wealth of ornament and decorative detail, also vanished, helped to unite the whole into an artistic har-<lb/>
mony. There were shimmering mosaics and surfaces of richly inlaid marble and a host of sculptural figures in marble and bronze. <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>, in addition to being a creative architectural thinker, was a connoisseur and patron of artists, owning a vast number of ancient Greek marbles and Roman copies of famous Greek sculptures. Sculptures of reclining river gods adorned the villa's many water gardens, and there were statues depicting Diana as mythological huntress and as a fer-<lb/>
tility goddess. Images of Perseus, Bacchus, Orpheus, Apollo, and other figures from classical mythology joined representations of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s beloved <name type="pname">Antinous</name>, who was portrayed in various godlike guises. These, with portrait busts of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name> himself, were probably placed in niches or beside some of the numerous gar-<lb/>
den paths of the villa.</p>
<p>The most important unifying factor is the one we miss most today: water. Hydraulic engineers were responsible for the fountains, pools, and canals that animated space with sky-reflecting mirrors of light. Standing at the Canopus today, we can only imagine the spectacle this part of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa presented when, with light playing on the curved and undulating surface of the moist, glittering, mosaic-covered half-<lb/>
dome and sparkling on the gently moving water of the canal, the most powerful ruler on earth looked out upon the proconsuls, ambassadors, and other dignitar-<lb/>
ies of the Roman Empire whose banqueting couches were arrayed before him.</p>
<p>Besides its function as place of entertainment, <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa served as a residence and place where the affairs of empire were dispatched. An original villa residence predating <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s purchase of the property was extensively revised to serve as imperial living quarters, and, inasmuch as the business of government followed the emperor wherever he went, the imperial secretariat required offices. Viewing structures, an East Belvedere and a West Belvedere, which overlooked valleys on respective sides of the property, served as scenic observation points and may have been destina-<lb/>
tions for conversational strolling.</p>
<p>For our purposes here&#x2014;the discussion of land-<lb/>
scape as an expression of cultural values&#x2014;attention should be drawn to two parts of the villa: the "Vale of Tempe" with its Doric Temple overlooking the eastern valley at the northern end of the property, and the incompletely excavated high ground that is in private ownership, where the South Theater and a network of underground tunnels exist. Modern scholars believe that the steep gorge in the eastern valley of the villa grounds, which was further deepened through quarry-<lb/>
ing operations, memorialized the Vale of Tempe near <name type="place">Mount Olympus</name> in northeastern <name type="place">Greece</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref> Dramati-<lb/>
cally situated above this beautiful spot, overlooking the wider landscape framed by the Tiburtine Hills, stands a small, circular, open-sided Doric garden temple enclosing a Roman copy of Praxiteles' famous statue of Aphrodite of Knidos (fig. 2.46). It was not a temple in any religious sense, but rather an ornamental struc-<lb/>
ture framed by a large <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi> (now vanished), the whole composition forming an architectural tribute to a poetically venerated Greek landscape.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the villa grounds was the South Theater, which, according to a recent thesis advanced by <name type="pname">William L. MacDonald</name> and <name type="pname">John A. Pinto</name>, may have accommodated the Eleusinian rites based upon the legend of Demeter and Persephone.<ref target="#CH2-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> These mysteries, symbolizing immortality of the human soul as well as the annual cycle of death and rebirth in nature, were performed at <name type="place">Eleusis</name> near <name type="place">Athens</name> and involved ritual descent into the Underworld domain of the god Hades. An elaborate network of tunnels con-<lb/>
nects with the theater, whose complicated infrastructure exceeds the needs of ordinary drama. <name type="pname">MacDonald</name> and <name type="pname">Pinto</name> have suggested that ritual participants may have descended from the stage into these subterranean pas-<lb/>
sages in an initiation ceremony. If this is correct, we may conclude that the replication of the experience one had at a famous religious center outside <name type="place">Athens</name> within an artfully contrived landscape of the Roman Cam-<lb/>
pagna demonstrates that spiritual objectives previously met in unique natural environments to which one made pilgrimage could now be found in synthetic ones built
<pb n="95"/>
<pb n="95" type="orig"/>
to recall them.</p>
<p>The villa's role as a "themed" environment, one enriched by imaginative association with other renowned places, can best be understood in terms of a shift in the relationship between humans and land-<lb/>
scape. In the cosmopolitan milieu of the Late Roman Empire it was natural that theatrical versions of earlier myth-impregnated environments should be con-<lb/>
structed. Then, as later in history, the garden or park landscape provided an ideal setting for such imagina-<lb/>
tive re-creations.</p>
<p>We have seen how the concept of landscape was trans-<lb/>
formed in antiquity from one in which form directly referenced elements of Earth and sky in an expression of cosmological belief to one in which symbols and the mimesis of other locales set in motion within the human imagination certain ideas and associations. We have seen, too, how urban order came to assume a far greater importance relative to the natural order than was true in the centuries of prehistory and early antiq-<lb/>
uity.</p>
<p>The allegorization of landscape was perhaps the most important and lasting contribution that the Late Roman villa designers bequeathed to posterity. The "theming" of a passage from <name type="pname">Homer</name>, as at <name type="place">Sperlonga</name>, wed landscape to literature in a striking tableau; here nature served as stage set, a theater for fantasy. The simulated Hades at <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa was a "virtual real-<lb/>
ity" experience of its day in which emotion was manip-<lb/>
ulated toward a religious end&#x2014;if the subterranean galleries there were indeed used in celebrating the Ele-<lb/>
usinian mysteries. Landscape had thus become some-<lb/>
thing both more and less than nature. It now was space to be assigned programmatic content rather than place pregnant with intrinsic meaning. Henceforth, land-<lb/>
scape design&#x2014;though sometimes purely functional or aesthetic in intent or merely imitative of earlier mod-<lb/>
els&#x2014;was imbued with a narrative impulse. The narra-<lb/>
tive motive still prevails today in commercial theme parks and certain self-theming historic districts, vil-<lb/>
lages, and old urban centers. Concepts of space and time are continually revised through the agencies of intellect and imagination. History has become a potent source of imagery as population growth and powerful Industrial Age technologies threaten both nature and the built past as never before. <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa is thus ancestor to numerous replications of geographically distant and temporally remote places in landscape design history, including the themed environments of today.</p>
<p>Ironically, at the same time that landscape was being domesticated and drained of the divinity that it had long embodied at various sacred sites in nature, allegory stood ready to put it into the service of two religious movements: Christianity and Islam. The use of water, sculpture, mosaic, and plants to evoke a spir-<lb/>
itual or poetic mood; the interpenetration of indoor and outdoor spaces; a growing interest in architectural sit-<lb/>
ing; a sensuous appreciation of light, color, and sound; topiary design and practice&#x2014;these are some of the things that Roman landscape designers bequeathed to future generations. Where they occupied former parts of the Roman Empire, Islamic garden designers incor-<lb/>
porated some classical elements into their plans, blend-<lb/>
ing them with their heritage from <name type="place">Persia</name>. But in the Christian West, life was thoroughly transformed in the centuries following the fall of <name type="place">Rome</name> and before the Renaissance. There no one any longer built villas with sybaritic bathing pools and gardens populated by myth-<lb/>
ological figures. Nor were there any luxurious town houses with indoor plumbing and gaily decorated foun-<lb/>
tains. <hi rend="italic">Triclinia</hi>_beneath vine-clad pergolas for long summer dinners disappeared.</p>
<p>Although luxury and license remained a preroga-<lb/>
tive of the aristocratic elite in Christian lands, people increasingly turned their eyes heavenward, and some exceptional monks even refused to eat the fruit they grew for fear of breaking their austere Christian vows. The worldly emphasis on three-dimensional space in architecture and painting was lost, but some of the old building forms, notably the peristyle garden, were too intrinsic a part of a basic building vocabulary to vanish completely. Most important, perhaps, the principal gar-<lb/>
dens after the fall of <name type="place">Rome</name> were no longer gardens in reality, but images of the earthly paradise that existed before the biblical fall of humankind or of the heavenly kingdom where the blessed could attain fruitful ease after the travails of this life.</p>

<note xml:id="CH2-n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="bold">1.</hi></seg><p>The term <hi rend="italic">classicism</hi> appears throughout this book. It refers to the human impulse in all the arts to create through a process of intellect&#x2014;rather than by intuition, emotion, or sensory association&#x2014;an ideal vision that by its nobility, authority, rationality, and harmonious order serves as a paradigm for imitation. These qual-<lb/>
ities are thought to have characterized the art and general culture of ancient <name type="place">Greece</name> and much of ancient <name type="place">Rome</name>, sources of inspiration to other cultures throughout history. Classicism thus respects tradition over innovation. In architecture and landscape architecture, clas-<lb/>
sicism implies participation in a tradition of measurability and mathematical precision as expressed in balanced, geometrical lines and forms and symmetry, as opposed to irregularity and asymmetry. When the word is capitalized within a sentence, it refers to a specific period, seen by historians as mature and pivotal within a stylistic development. Examples include: the art of <name type="place">Greece</name> in the last three-quarters of the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, or the art created in Renais-<lb/>
sance <name type="place">Italy</name> from about <date when="1505">1505</date> to about <date when="1525">1525</date>. <hi rend="italic">Neoclassicism</hi> refers to any of the many revival idioms that evoke the balance, order, symme-<lb/>
try, and stylistic simplicity of classicism, often imitating in period design or detail a style con-<lb/>
sidered as Classical. For example, the Beaux-<lb/>
Arts style in American architecture and landscape design in the years around <date when="1900">1900</date> is neoclassical, being derived from the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts in <name type="place">Paris</name>, which based its curriculum upon the principles of French seventeenth-cen-<lb/>
tury design; in turn, those traced their origin to the Italian Renaissance and to the Classical monuments in Roman architecture.</p></note>

</figure>
<p>Rooted in human responses to the environment in all his-<lb/>
torical cultures is a deep-seated recognition of the manifold imperfections of this world and a deep longing to re-create a lost place or time where and when life perpetually flourishes, death is unknown, there are no harsh extremes of climate, and no back-<lb/>
breaking toil to grow food and haul water, fear is replaced by law, chaos is vanquished by order, and warfare ceases forever in a perpetual reign of peace. Most of the world's myths&#x2014;biblical, classical, Islamic, early Christian, medieval, Chinese&#x2014;expound this theme.</p>
<p>The word <hi rend="italic">paradise</hi> is derived from the Persian <hi rend="italic">pairi-<lb/>
daeza</hi>, signifying a royal hunting park or orchard enclosed by walls (fig. 3.1).,<ref target="#CH3-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> Paradise, both as a literary topos and as a realized garden, is ideologically divorced from the world and physically separated from it. It is not outwardly expansive and space-em-<lb/>
bracing, but rather spatially contained and inward-focused. This mythical paradise is, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, a place where humans and animals enjoy a vegetarian bounty and do not prey on one another. The Islamic tradition adds to this benign and secure environment, where the blessed enjoy fruitful ease, such sensory delights as delectable food, wine, music, fragrance, and erotic love.</p>
<p>It is important not to overemphasize the paradise meta-<lb/>
phor at the expense of certain mundane considerations such as topography, climate, or the representation of the beneficent power of a ruler to fructify the local landscape. Nevertheless, the para-<lb/>
dise image&#x2014;a bountiful, geometrically ordered, enclosed space in which water is typically made to flow in four directions, ema-<lb/>
nating from and sometimes returning to a central source&#x2014;is the common paradigm for expressing multiple associations, both religious and secular, in actual Islamic and Western medieval gar-<lb/>
dens. Such gardens can be found in Muslim lands extending from Mughal <name type="place">India</name> to Moorish <name type="place">Spain</name> and elsewhere in <name type="place">Europe</name> as the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi>, the enclosed garden, depicted in Christian medieval manuscripts, tapestries, and woodcuts and exemplified in the cloister gardens of monasteries and churches. The visions of paradise as manifested both in actual gardens and in the art of these cultures all imply a reordering of the things of this world to create an idealized and rationally organized environment. Simi-<lb/>
larly, the notion of paradise as a systematic arrangement of all created plant species underlies the layouts of Renaissance botan-<lb/>
ical gardens.</p>
<p>It is difficult now to imagine how harsh and unfriendly the natural world once seemed and equally impossible to con-<lb/>
ceive the fear people once had of wilderness. The impulse to romanticize wild nature as expressed in a more naturalistic approach to garden-making&#x2014;an approach that implies paradox-<lb/>
ically a relatively high level of technological confidence and eco-<lb/>
nomic dominion over nature&#x2014;was completely foreign to the cultural milieus in which true paradise gardens were created. Romanticism as an attitude and the design ideas that flow from it date only from the latter part of the eighteenth century. Although the word "paradise" is often used loosely to denote any garden that is in essence idyllic, the garden symbolizing paradise as it is described in the Quran and the Bible is almost always nature (including human nature) tamed, domesticated, and regulated. According to the Judaeo-Christian view, paradise is a paradigm not only for the garden but also for the just city and the holy man or woman whose well-ordered existence symbolizes obedience to the laws of God. Before examining some actual landscapes that were intended to portray the order, tranquillity, bounty, and free-<lb/>
dom from want and care that two world religions, Islam and Christianity, associate with paradise, we should enrich our under-<lb/>
standing of paradise as a literary topos. This will help us to under-<lb/>
stand the important new role that landscape design came to play as a means of creating representational space, places in which symbols evoked ideas and ideals other than those of a purely paradisiacal nature.</p>

<p>The price of disobedience, as readers of Genesis know, is expulsion from paradise. In this account, the newly made Earth was devoid of all vegetation because there was no creature to till it and no rain, but rather a flood rising up out of the ground, irrigating its barren plains.</p>
<q>
<p>Then the <name type="pname">Lord God</name> planted a garden in <name type="place">Eden</name> away to the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. The <name type="pname">Lord God</name> made trees spring from the ground, all trees pleasant to look at and good for food; and in the middle of the garden he set the tree of life and the tree of good and evil.<ref target="#CH3-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q>
<p>This laconic account gives us very few visual details with which to flesh out this imaginary "first" garden. We are told, however, that "there was a river flowing from <name type="place">Eden</name> to water the garden, and when it left the garden it branched into four streams."<ref target="#CH3-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Of the Hebrew and Christian vision of heaven the Bible gives us even less scenic description, and there have been but few representations in the rich inventory of Western religious art to suggest its physical attri-<lb/>
butes. The idea, however, of a middle place marked by the presence of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Good and Evil, with four streams flowing away from it, pre-<lb/>
sumably in the four cardinal directions, echoes in bib-<lb/>
lical terms the cosmological diagram familiar to us from other prehistoric cultures of a vertical <hi rend="italic">axis mundi</hi> with four horizontal axes extending to the east, west, north, and south points of the horizon. Irrigation run-<lb/>
nels laid out according to a quadripartite pattern such as this must have occurred in some arid parts of the Ancient Near East where agriculture was first prac-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Classical Paradises</hi></hi></head>
<p>The longevity and the universality of visions signified by the word <hi rend="italic">paradise</hi> are evident from many descrip-<lb/>
tions in classical literature. <name type="pname">Homer</name> created an image of the garden as a paradisiacal reward for valor in his description of the Elysian Fields in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>. Here <name type="pname">Menelaus</name> receives the news that
<q>
<lg>
<l>the gods intend you for Elysion</l>
<l>with golden Rhadamanthos at the world's end,</l>
<l>where all existence is a dream of ease.</l>
<l>Snowfall is never known there, nor long</l>
<l>frost of winter, nor torrential rain,</l>
<l>but only mild and lulling airs from Ocean</l>
<l>bearing refreshment for the souls of men&#x2014;</l>
<l>the West Wind always blowing.<ref target="#CH3-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> also contains <name type="pname">Homer</name>'s famous descrip-<lb/>
tion of the paradisiacal orchard of Alcinous, which "long-suffering Odysseus stood admiring" before entering the house of his host:
<q>
<lg>
<l>There tall trees grow luxuriantly, pears</l>
<l>and pomegranates, apples bright with fruit,</l>
<l>delicious figs, and flowering olive trees.</l>
<l>Their fruit can never fail nor ever perish,</l>
<l>winter or summer, all year long, for always</l>
<l>Zephyr blows, nurturing some and ripening oth-<lb/>
ers.</l>
<l>Apple on apple, pear on pear matures,</l>
<l>fig upon fig, and grape on clustered grape.</l>
<l>A vineyard rich in fruit is rooted there:</l>
<l>part is spread out on level ground to dry</l>
<l>in sunlight, part is harvested at vintage,</l>
<l>and part they trample. Unripe grapes in front</l>
<l>shed flowers while the others slowly darken.</l>
<l>By the last row, well-ordered garden plots</l>
<pb n="99"/>
<pb n="99" type="orig"/>
<l>grow bountiful fresh greens of every kind.</l>
<l>Two springs flow, one dispersed throughout the garden,</l>
<l>the other gushing from the courtyard, near</l>
<l>the towering house where townsfolk come for water.<ref target="#CH3-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>Myths of Rhadamanthos, Elysion, the Blessed Isles, the distant east (or west), and magical mountain-<lb/>
tops&#x2014;places impossibly remote for ordinary travelers to reach&#x2014;were prevalent until the late fifteenth century, when Europeans discovered and explored vast areas of the planet that had long been <hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> in their minds. Before this time the hopeful belief persisted that physical paradise was an actual faraway realm where one might be transported under the right conditions. Along with this ideal of a terrestrial paradise, which might be discovered by far-voyaging mariners, was the notion in classical literature, paralleling the story of the Fall of Man in Genesis, of the lost paradise of a vanished Golden Age.</p>
<p>The Greek poet <name type="pname">Hesiod</name>'s eighth-century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Works and Days</hi>, articulates both concepts. His version of the Prometheus and Pandora myths helps explain the hard lot of humankind, condemned to wres-<lb/>
tle with the obdurate earth to grow the crops that sustain life, after having first known freedom from want. <hi rend="italic">Works and Days</hi> also gave Greeks a sense of their descent from a race of heroes. It elaborates a series of ages of dimin-<lb/>
ishing ease, physical accomplishment, and nobility of heart and mind: a Golden Age, a Silver Age, a Bronze Age, and a current Age of Iron, an age of warfare and unremitting labor. Other cultures have mythologized similar epochs of regressive human well-being. <name type="pname">Hesiod</name>, however, hon-<lb/>
ors the remembrance of Mycenaean glory and the epic tradition of the Dark Age immortalized by <name type="pname">Homer</name> and inserts, between his Bronze Age and the present diffi-<lb/>
cult Iron Age, an Age of Heroes, those legendary war-<lb/>
rior kings who consorted with the gods in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>.</p>
<q>
<lg>
<l>War and carnage propelled many of these heroes to their doom,</l>
<l>Yet others of them father <name type="pname">Zeus</name>, son of <name type="pname">Kronos</name>, set-<lb/>
tled at earth's ends,</l>
<l>apart from men, and gave them shelter and food.</l>
<l>They lived there with hearts unburdened by cares</l>
<l>in the islands of the blessed, near stormy Okeanos,</l>
<l>these blissful heroes for whom three times a year</l>
<l>the barley-giving land brings forth full grain sweet as honey.<ref target="#CH3-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q>
<p>The Greek lyric poet <name type="pname">Pindar</name> (c. 522&#x2013;c. 443 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) later developed the theme of a vanished epoch when people lived in innocence and knew no hardship or sor-<lb/>
row. Among the Roman poets, <name type="pname">Virgil</name> (70&#x2013;19 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) offered a prophetic vision of a new Golden Age under Emperor <name type="pname">Augustus</name>, while <name type="pname">Ovid</name> (43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>&#x2013;17 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) looked back nostalgically on a bygone time of simple rustic happiness.</p>
<p>In addition to their temporal images of a previous era of peace and plenty, the spatial concepts of faraway Elysian Fields and Blessed Isles provided consoling visions of an afterlife for the deserving. These two visions, one of an ancient time of bounteousness and tranquillity, the other of a just reward after death, are akin to the two Christian usages of the term <hi rend="italic">paradise</hi> to sig-<lb/>
nify a prelapsarian Garden of <name type="place">Eden</name> and a post-Resurrec-<lb/>
tion home for the faithful in heaven.</p>
<p>By the fifth century, the Christian vision of paradise had been appropriated by the late classical <name type="pname">Carthaginian</name> poet <name type="pname">Blossius Aemilius Dracontius</name> who described it thus:
<q>
<lg>
<l>A place there is from which four rivers flow,</l>
<l>painted with jeweled turf and deathless flowers,</l>
<l>full of sweet-scented, never-fading herbs,</l>
<l>happiest garden in God's universe.<ref target="#CH3-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></l>

</q></p>
<p><name type="pname">Alcimus Ecdicius Av&#x00ED;tus</name>, bishop of <name type="place">Vienna</name> from c. 490 to 518, draws on well-established tradition in his <hi rend="italic">De Spiritalis Historiae Gestis</hi>, locating paradise
<q>
<lg>
<l>East of the Indies, where the world begins,</l>
<l>where earth and sky are said to meet together.</l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>Paradise for <name type="pname">Av&#x00ED;tus</name> is a place where
<q>
<lg>
<l>temperate climes preserve eternal spring;</l>
<l>rough winds are absent, under sunny skies</l>
<l>clouds yield to unremittingly clear weather.</l>
<l>The nature of the place requires no rain,</l>
<l>for grasses thrive contentedly on dew.</l>
<l>The ground is always green, earth's smiling face</l>
<l>radiates warmth; plants grow on hills forever,</l>
<l>and leaves on trees: for though they burst in flower</l>
<l>often, swift sap invigorates their buds.<ref target="#CH3-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref></l>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Muslim Paradise</hi></hi></head>
<p>The Quran, the book of divine wisdom derived from the Hebrew Bible and revealed to <name type="pname">Muhammad</name> by God in the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, has four rivers emanating from para-<lb/>
dise as in Genesis. Here, however, the rivers are more metaphorical than geographical, eternally flowing streams of milk and purified honey. The Quran dwells on
<pb n="100"/>
<pb n="100" type="orig"/>
the luxury and opulence of paradise, the prize for the godly. There the blessed, dressed in robes of silk, will be rewarded:
<q>
<p>Reclining upon soft couches, they shall feel neither the scorching heat nor the biting cold. Trees will spread their shade around them, and fruits will hang in clusters over them.</p>
<p>They shall be served with silver dishes, and beakers as large as goblets; silver goblets which they themselves shall measure: the cups brim-full with ginger-flavored water from the Fount of Sel-<lb/>
sabil. They shall be attended by boys graced with eternal youth, who to the beholder's eyes will seem like sprinkled pearls. When you gaze upon that scene you will behold a kingdom blissful and glori-<lb/>
ous.<ref target="#CH3-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q></p>
<p>There is an understandable emphasis upon cooling shade, clear running water, and refreshing beverages in a desert culture. The elite and affluent imagery of the Qura-<lb/>
nic paradise&#x2014;a luxurious desert oasis with four water-<lb/>
courses streaming from it&#x2014;has been metaphorically linked with the designs for Islamic royal gardens. Like the gardens of the Christian West, these invest the primal cosmological diagram with a specific symbolism and reli-<lb/>
gious authority. This is evident in their spatial organiza-<lb/>
tion, with a central raised platform serving as the dais for an important structure, often a monarch's pavilion or tomb, and four water channels marking the principal compass directions. But, unlike the garden in the Chris-<lb/>
tian West, the Islamic garden was a place where erotic love was given appropriate license.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Islamic Gardens of Delight</hi></hi></head>
<p>In the literature of Islam, the garden does double duty in a metaphorical sense, its attributes being assigned to God by the mystics and to the human lover by the poets. God's grace could be read in the springtime, which briefly col-<lb/>
ored and brightened the parched landscapes that consti-<lb/>
tute much of the Muslim world; there are paeans of praise to the coming of spring in Islamic writing. In all seasons, the oasislike paradise garden reflects the heavenly glory. There one finds the faithful personified as the gatekeeper of Paradise, and abundance in the form of a heavenly fountain. There in the Garden of <name type="place">Eden</name> (the primordial garden and the eternal garden are synonymous in the Quran) stands the Tuba tree, furnishing a double image as it symbolizes both a state of blessedness and the slender grace of the beloved.</p>
<p>The opposition between divine and human love that permeates Christian texts is absent in Quranic mystical thought. <name type="pname">Ruzbihan Baqli</name> in the twelfth century advised spiritual recreation in the contemplation of three things: water, greenery, and a lovely face. All of the garden's flowers existed for the purpose of praising God, and each was assigned one or more divine attributes. Simultane-<lb/>
ously, these same flowers stood for the beauty of various human body parts. Thus the tulip, which symbolizes the martyr, also represents the cheek (as do the hyacinth and the pomegranate flower), and the narcissus, whose white "blind" eye symbolizes the unenlightened, also furnishes an appropriate compliment to the real eyes of the lover. In describing a lovely woman in his <hi rend="italic">Shah-nama</hi> ("Book of Kings"), the Persian national epic, the eleventh-cen-<lb/>
tury poet <name type="pname">Firdawsi</name>, compiled a rich collection of gar-<lb/>
den-derived metaphors and similes:
<q>
<p>She was like ivory from head to toe, with a face like Paradise and a figure as graceful as a tree. Her cheeks were as red as pomegranate blossoms and her lips its seeds, while two pomegranates grew from her silver breast. Her eyes were like the narcis-<lb/>
sus in the garden, and her eyebrows stole the black-<lb/>
ness from the crow's feathers. She is Paradise to look upon.<ref target="#CH3-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q></p>
<p>The flower <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>_in the Islamic garden is the <hi rend="italic">gul</hi>, or rose. So revered and admired is it that the very name of the garden, <hi rend="italic">gulshan</hi> (also <hi rend="italic">gulzar</hi>) embodies its name. According to Muslim mystics, the rose was created from a drop of perspiration that fell from <name type="pname">Muhammad</name>'s forehead. The rose, which also provided the conventional analogy for the face of the Beloved, sometimes repre-<lb/>
sented the beautiful <hi rend="italic">houri</hi> who inhabited Paradise. In the mystic tradition, the rose also stands for the soul at peace, its evocative fragrance lingering after it has died. In addi-<lb/>
tion, its many petals folded into one graceful flower sym-<lb/>
bolize union and harmony among humankind. These associations furnished the symbolic substance of the Islamic garden.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Christian Allegorical Exegesis of The Song of Songs</hi></hi></head>
<p>The most lyrically erotic book of the Old Testament is the biblical love poem known as The Song of Songs. Written as a dialogue between the bride and bridegroom (identi-<lb/>
fied with <name type="pname">Solomon</name>), with a chorus of companions provid-<lb/>
ing commentary, The Song of Songs is filled with erotic energy, as the bridal couple extol each other in the lan-<lb/>
guage of landscape with image after image of fragrance, fruit, gem, tree, monument, mountaintop, and comely animal. Nature, both wild and cultivated, is summoned forth in all its processes of dynamic change to evoke the alternating presence and absence of the loved one. Pome-<lb/>
granates, gazelles, asphodels, and lilies are pressed into literary service as similes to describe the beloved.</p>
<p>The interpretation put forward by <name type="pname">Saint Bernard</name>,
<pb n="101"/>
<pb n="101" type="orig"/>
abbot of <name type="pname">Clairvaux</name> (1090&#x2013;1153), transformed these images of the Garden of Love into symbols of divine communion by means of an elaborate exegesis in which the poem became an expression of the <name type="pname">Virgin Mary</name>'s election as the Bride of God and Christ's mys-<lb/>
tical union with his Church. Given the extremely sen-<lb/>
suous nature of the poem, it illustrates not only Christianity's ability to square Scripture with its strong bias in favor of chastity but also its tendency to see allegorical meaning in worldly phenomena.</p>
<p>The bridegroom's declaration,
<q>
<p>My sister, my bride, is a garden close-locked, a garden close-locked, a fountain sealed,<ref target="#CH3-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q>
is converted into a specific symbol of <name type="pname">Mary</name>'s virginity, her womb being a metaphorical garden where the Christ, the Tree of Life, was planted by God.</p>
<p>The Christian interpretation of The Song of Songs as an allegory led to the depiction of the <name type="pname">Virgin Mary</name> in the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi>, or enclosed garden, conventionally shown as a flowery meadow inside high walls or encircled by a low wattle fence of the kind familiar all over <name type="place">Europe</name> during the Middle Ages (fig. 3.2). Such fences were constructed to keep wild animals out of cultivated garden plots. One mythical beast, however, was permitted entrance: the unicorn. With its tireless speed and single invincible horn, this imaginary animal symbolizes Christ, who allows Himself to be caught in order to lie down in the Vir-<lb/>
gin's lap&#x2014;that is, he allows himself to be born on Earth. The Marian garden that we most often see in medieval tapestries, miniatures, and prints is a flow-<lb/>
er-studded greensward in which the flowers all have allegorical attributes. The budding rose represents the Virgin's modesty and the lily her purity, while the iris, (the <hi rend="italic">fleur de lys</hi>) stands both for the Kings of <name type="place">France</name> and, by inference, for the line of <name type="pname">David</name> and <name type="pname">Jesus</name>. The garden's straight paths symbolize divine order, and its fountains refer to the sealed fountain in The Song of Songs. Wild landscape and wild animals (except for the mythical unicorn) are firmly excluded from the Marian <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi> by a wattle fence, hedge of thorns, or high wall.</p>
<p>For some devout early Christians, the wilderness was emphatically not a place for Thoreau-like obser-<lb/>
vation and self-knowledge, but rather a hostile and unfriendly locale, its scenery a metaphor for the rigor with which the saintly penitent must subdue the evil forces within his own breast. By making wild, uncul-<lb/>
tivated nature the domain of demons, Christian thought devalued nature and robbed it of its previous sanctity. Caves became the cells of hermits instead of the homes of oracles, and mountaintops were no lon-<lb/>
ger the abodes of gods as they had been in antiquity, but rather the setting for Christian trial and temptation. Because an apocalyptic ending of human history was predicted and all hope fastened on the afterlife, the beauty of Earth was devalued. Further, denial of the real world gave license to the exploitation of nature and its subjugation to human will. Humans, however, could not remain sensually indifferent to the world or their own sexuality. As will become apparent, the gar-<lb/>
den&#x2014;controlled nature&#x2014;would remain, as it was for the author of The Song of Songs the locus of an ideal-<lb/>
ized approach to love.</p>

<p>Although Christianity firmly revoked the license that ancient peoples, such as the Hebrews, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, had accorded erotic love and con-<lb/>
demned contemporary Islamic mores as sybaritic, the association between gardens and human love remained rooted in the Western imagination. The garden's func-<lb/>
tion as an arena of allegory dealing with the trials and triumphs of young love was perpetuated in medieval and Renaissance literature. Around 1230, the French poet <name type="pname">Guillaume de Lorris</name> narrated his dream of romantic love in an epic poem, <hi rend="italic">The Romance of the Rose</hi>, a work that was carried forward some forty years later by <name type="pname">Jean de Meung</name>, who provided it with an ending that is entirely different in meaning from that intended by its first author (fig. 3.3).</p>
<p>Drawing on the style of the troubadours, <name type="pname">Guil-<lb/>
laume de Lorris</name> invests his portion of the poem with a delicate psychology that goes beyond the troubadours' usual one-sided treatment of love into an exploration of the heart and mind of the lady who is symbolized by the Rose. His part ends with the rejected Lover's realization that he cannot simply overcome all the barriers sur-<lb/>
rounding the object of his desire. In order for him to possess the love of the Rose, she must also have her heart pierced by love's arrow.</p>
<p>In <name type="pname">Jean de Meung</name>'s conclusion&#x2014;a brief for the importance of procreation&#x2014;the Lover persists in his quest and is encouraged to ravish the Rose. <name type="pname">Venus</name> leads the charge, and the Rose's guardian is persuaded to give her to the Lover who joyously proceeds to deflower her. However, the tone here is moral, not lewd. The Lover is not only rewarded with his time love but also with the prize of paradise. To achieve this happy ending, the author of the second part of the poem effectively exposes the earthly garden of courtly, romantic love as false, while building his case for the fruitful garden of procre-<lb/>
ation as the Christian pasture of the Good Shepherd.</p>
<p>In the hundred life-affirming stories of the <hi rend="italic">Decam-<lb/>
eron</hi> by <name type="pname">Giovanni Boccaccio</name> (<date when="1313">1313</date>&#x2013;<date when="1375">1375</date>), written in the middle of the fourteenth century when the Black Death ravaged the population, flesh and spirit are compatible; both are a natural, joyous part of existence. Choosing as a model the Villa Palmieri near <name type="place">Florence</name>, <name type="pname">Boccaccio</name> describes an enclosed garden with its crisscross of wide rose-and jasmine-bordered paths "all straight as arrows and overhung by pergolas of vines," its orange and lemon trees and white marble fountain "covered with marvelous bas-reliefs." Here men and women could enjoy one another's company and praise the garden as a the very model of paradise:
<q>
<p>The sight of this garden, and the perfection of its arrangement, with its shrubs, its streamlets, and the fountain from which they originated, gave so much pleasure to each of the ladies and the three young men that they all began to maintain that if Paradise were constructed on earth, it was inconceivable that it could take any other form.<ref target="#CH3-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q></p>
<p>The notion of the garden as an enclosed space, set apart, and infused with metaphorical meaning&#x2014;a rep-<lb/>
resentation of nature perfected through human art in the service of an ideal&#x2014;is fundamental to our understand-<lb/>
ing of the history of landscape design.<ref target="#CH3-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref> The literature of paradise gave rise to the notion of the garden as a sym-<lb/>
bolical space, and thus the written word helped land-<lb/>
scape design assume a role beyond the one of prehistoric and classical times in which humans accorded divinity to actual sites in nature, shaping space and arranging architectural forms in relationship to the sky and certain features of Earth such as mountains and caves. The con-<lb/>
cept of landscape as symbolically divine, rather than actually divine space, derived particular strength from Islamic and Christian religious ideology as is evident in the way in which these world cultures translated the par-<lb/>
adise ideal into the form of actual gardens.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">II. Paradise on Earth: The Islamic Garden</hi></hi></head>
<p>In desert lands, the oasis is typically viewed as a kind of paradise, a respite from the parched land and withering sun. Through conquest and a tolerant religion, the nation of Islam spread westward across <name type="place">North Africa</name> to south-<lb/>
ern <name type="place">Spain</name> and eastward into <name type="place">Central Asia</name> and <name type="place">India</name>, a territory composed principally of vast dry zones with extremes of heat and cold within which scattered green oases furnished a most precious element, water. In their migrations, Islamic peoples absorbed elements bor-<lb/>
rowed from other design traditions, which they synthe-<lb/>
sized into a distinctive style. In desert climates and also where water flowed seasonally, the four heavenly rivers of paradise described in the Quran and the refreshing fountains, as well as the shade and fruit trees to be found there, provided apt symbols for paradise in the oasislike Islamic garden.</p>
<p>Unlike Japanese or English gardens, Persian gar-<lb/>
dens and their Islamic successors were not constructed as spatial itineraries, places of sequential discovery; rather they were designed to serve the purposes of lux-<lb/>
urious ease and sensory delight or, in the case of Mughal tomb gardens, as settings for monuments of commemoration. Water's soothing sound and mesmer-<lb/>
izing reflectivity were essential to their ephemeral atmosphere and paradisiacal character. Built mostly in warm climates, they were exterior living spaces, often sumptuous, yet airy. The porticoed palace, the garden pavilion, and the kiosk opened up to the out-of-doors, and often their walls were pierced by grills to admit a filigree of fragmented light, dematerializing interior space. In these spaces, the distinction between inside and out, between architecture and landscape, between the material world and poetry, seems almost to dissolve.</p>
<p>Fruit trees and flowers, birds and animals, shim-<lb/>
mering tiles, and the gleam and murmur of running water&#x2014;these are the vibrant and delicate substances from which, like a beautiful carpet, the Islamic garden is woven. Indeed, Islamic carpet design and garden lay-<lb/>
out go hand in hand. Garden carpets depict in a stylized manner the <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">chahar bagh</hi></name>, or fourfold garden with its intersecting axial watercourses surmounted by a central fountain (fig. 3.4). In addition, they depict symbolically the vegetation planted in actual gardens: the shade-giv-<lb/>
ing plane tree, identified with the Tuba tree in the Quran; the cypress representing death and eternity; and fruit trees standing for life and fertility. The central cartouche can be interpreted as a platform, which in real gardens was often surmounted by a pavilion. These form the basic and timeless design formula of the Islamic gar-<lb/>
den&#x2014;one or more quadripartite sections defined by narrow watercourses&#x2014;which has its roots in ancient <name type="place">Persia</name> where the archaeological remains of <name type="place">Achaemenid</name> palaces trace the outlines of pavilions overlooking carved stone channels.</p>
<p>The paradigm of quadripartite landscape space with a defined center, from which energy flows out-<lb/>
ward in four directions and to which energy returns from the four corners of the cosmos, is a place-making practice rooted, as we have seen, in prehistoric tradi-<lb/>
tion. But there is a distinction to be made between Islamic and prehistoric cosmological design. Prehis-<lb/>
toric societies viewed landscape space in terms that charged <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> local landscapes with intense religious meaning; their organization of space into quadripar-<lb/>
tite-center configurations was a declaration of the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> residence of divinity within a given landscape. Islamic garden design was rooted in a religion that was also impregnated with cosmological meaning, but because holy literature had begun to supplement and supplant oral tradition, thereby disse-minating religion more broadly, a universal cosmological <hi rend="italic">symbolism</hi>_of sacred space, rather than the designation of certain spaces as cosmologically sacred, was now an operative cultural principle guiding landscape design. This obser-<lb/>
vation is true for Hebrew-derived, Christian landscape design as well.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Early Persian Gardens</hi></hi></head>
<p>It will be recalled that the word <hi rend="italic">paradise</hi> was originally used to denote a hunting park. <name type="pname">Xenophon</name> (c. 431&#x2013;c. 352 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), the soldier and writer who was a disciple of <name type="pname">Socrates</name>, reports on the beauty of the hunting park, the <hi rend="italic">pairidaeza</hi> at <name type="pname">Sardis</name>, of the <name type="place">Achaemenid</name> king <name type="pname">Cyrus</name> the
<pb n="104"/>
<pb n="104" type="orig"/>
Great (died c. 529 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>). From <name type="pname">Xenophon</name>'s descrip-<lb/>
tion we learn that this royal park was both a hunting park and a geometrically planted orchard. At <name type="place">Pasarga-<lb/>
dae</name>, <name type="pname">Cyrus</name> the Great constructed a palace, a separate audience hall, and a garden pavilion overlooking a stone watercourse with square pools at regular inter-<lb/>
vals.</p>
<p>The shady porticoes of the palace and audience hall at <name type="place">Pasargadae</name>, as well as the garden pavilion itself, overlooked the thin ribbon of water and the orchard-garden that surrounded it. Thus we find in the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> the two indispensable elements of Persian garden design: a straight, geometrically elabo-<lb/>
rated watercourse and a raised platform for garden viewing.</p>
<p>To supply such gardens as this with water, <name type="place">Ach-<lb/>
aemenid</name> engineers constructed underground tunnels called <hi rend="italic">qanats</hi>_using a method developed as early as the sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and still in use today. These were laboriously dug by hand from the point of delivery to the base of a snow-capped mountain in a gentle ever-ascending grade. Shafts for debris removal and air supply created openings at intervals of approxi-<lb/>
mately 50 feet, and these apertures still dot the vast Iranian plain.</p>
<p>After the conquest of <name type="place">Persia</name> by <name type="pname">Alexander</name> the Great (356&#x2013;323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), a century of Hellenizing influ-<lb/>
ence preceded the re-establishment of a Persian empire and Persian design traditions under the Parthi-<lb/>
ans (c. 240 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>&#x2013;226 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>). Their capital was Ctes-ip-<lb/>
hon. Between the third and seventh centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, the Sassanians, successors to Parthian rule, who also made Ctesiphon their capital, continued to express Persian influence in their gardens. As inferred from the design of a legendary Persian carpet measuring 450 feet by 90 feet, which was woven for <name type="pname">King Khos-<lb/>
row I Anushirvan</name> (ruled 531&#x2013;579 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>), the imagery of the fourfold garden, divided by channels of running water, with a platform overlooking these water-<lb/>
courses, was an established idiom for actual garden construction. This Persian legacy accorded well with the Quranic concept of paradise, providing a readily accessible model for the Islamic garden.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Islamic Origins</hi></hi></head>
<p>In 610 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, the prophet <name type="pname">Muhammed</name> initiated the Mus-<lb/>
lim religion. It quickly spread through the Arabian peninsula and into the Middle East and <name type="place">Persia</name>. In 766 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, the <name type="pname">Abbasid</name> caliphs, having asserted their politi-<lb/>
cal dominance, founded their capital of <name type="place">Baghdad</name> on the <name type="place">Tigris River</name>. During their rule between the eighth and the thirteenth century, horticulture and technology advanced rapidly. By the early tenth century, the city could boast twenty-three palaces with opulent gar-<lb/>
dens. One of these fabled, long-vanished palaces was known as the House of the Tree. An artificial tree stood in the middle of a large round pond and had eighteen boughs made of gold and silver hung with precious gems in the form of fruits. This ingenious automata had gold and silver birds perched on its branches, and these emitted musical notes when stirred by the passing breeze.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, beginning in the eighth century, Islamic warriors carried their culture west to <name type="place">Spain</name>. Here Muslim rulers synthesized Hellenistic, Roman, Early Christian, and Persian influences. As the power of the <name type="pname">Abbasid</name> caliphs declined, their role shifted from one of political power to one of religious leadership. <name type="place">Baghdad</name> fell to <name type="place">Mongol</name> invaders in <date when="1258">1258</date>, following the campaigns of <name type="pname">Genghis Khan</name> and his heirs, but Islamic culture nonetheless remained a unifying force throughout much of <name type="place">Asia</name>, <name type="place">North Africa</name>, and <name type="place">Spain</name>. Within this culture, the essential garden formula of a watercourse and raised platform for sedentary view-<lb/>
ing was further developed as a quadripartite space in which the divisions were articulated by narrow water channels that could be thought of as symbolizing the four rivers of paradise.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Islamic Gardens of <name type="place">Spain</name></hi></hi></head>
<p>The leaders of the Muslim army that invaded <name type="place">Spain</name> in 711 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> were inspired by the hope of plunder as much as by religious enthusiasm. After defeating the Visig-<lb/>
oths, the western Goths who had in the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> claimed the parts of the Roman Empire now occu-<lb/>
pied by <name type="place">France</name> and <name type="place">Spain</name>, the Arabs established them-<lb/>
selves within the remains of their enemies' settlements and the extensive ruins of former Roman colonies. Then, in 750, after a palace revolution, a surviving member of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> caliphate, the first dynasty of Arab caliphs (661&#x2013;750), fled <name type="pname">Damascus</name> to found the independent emirate of al-Andalus in the southern Spanish region that is known today as <name type="place">Andalusia</name>. Geographically distant, therefore, from Islamic cul-<lb/>
ture in the Middle East, the Arabs in <name type="place">Spain</name> formed their own brilliant and erudite society. Here in <name type="place">Spain</name>, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities coexisted under Arab rule. The Arabs had brought with them Persian artistic concepts along with Arabic science, and they married these with Greek philosophy. In this way, <name type="pname">C&#x00F3;rdoba</name> became in the Middle Ages a center of learning, renowned for such philosophers as <name type="pname">Ibn Rushd</name>, known in the West as <name type="pname">Averro&#x00EB;s</name> (<date when="1126">1126</date>&#x2013;<date when="1198">1198</date>), a rationalist who translated <name type="pname">Aristotle</name> and anticipated <name type="pname">Thomas Aquinas</name>.</p>
<p>While southern <name type="place">Spain</name> has the same hot climate as many other parts of the Islamic geographical sphere, its topography is for the most part more rug-<lb/>
ged and its land well watered and more fertile. Moor-<lb/>
ish engineers, rebuilding and extending the remains of
<pb n="105"/>
<pb n="105" type="orig"/>
Roman aqueducts all around them, created intricate irrigation systems by introducing the <hi rend="italic">noria</hi>, a buck-<lb/>
et-scoop waterwheel that raised water into elevated canals. This greatly increased the amount of arable land and facilitated the construction of numerous gar-<lb/>
dens. Agriculture prospered, and famous treatises on the subject were written, such as the one by <name type="pname">Abu Zakariya</name>, a thirteenth-century agronomist and botanist in <name type="place">Seville</name>. Farmers introduced sugarcane and brought into cultivation rice, cotton, flax, silkworms, and many kinds of fruit. Both the valley of the Guadalaquivir and the plain of <name type="place">Granada</name> became densely settled zones with a rich tapestry of agriculture and gardening, their air fragrant with the scent of orange, lemon, and citron trees.<ref target="#CH3-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Topography and contact with the abundant remains of <name type="pname">Iberian Rome</name> served to modify the con-<lb/>
querors' Syrian architectural heritage with its previ-<lb/>
ously assimilated Roman and Persian forms. But Spanish Muslim architecture never aspired to the monumental three-dimensionality of architecture in the West. Instead, its aim was atmospheric, and its highest achievement lay in the interweaving of indoor and outdoor spaces in sensuous and sophisticated ways. Thus, in a typical Moorish house and garden, the patio and the structural spaces surrounding it inter-<lb/>
penetrate one another in a casual yet studied congress of architecture and nature. Ceramic tiles, with their brightly glazed, reflective surfaces, produced an effect of cool airiness.</p>

<p>The spatial interpenetration of indoors and out-<lb/>
doors was not confined to fortress palaces or homes such as are found today in the Albaic&#x00ED;n district of <name type="place">Granada</name>, where the durable plan of the Roman peri-<lb/>
style was appropriated and reinterpreted as the <hi rend="italic">car-<lb/>
men</hi>, the inward-focused house and garden of Arabic <name type="place">Spain</name> (fig. 3.5). The same planning principle can be seen in the design of the Great Mosque at <name type="pname">C&#x00F3;rdoba</name>, begun in 785&#x2013;6. The mosque (now a cathedral), has a hypostyle interior in which the columns supporting a vast number of horseshoe-shaped double arches are evenly placed throughout like rows of trees in an orchard. Originally the wall on this side of the mosque opened via a fa&#x00E7;ade of arches to a 3-acre courtyard planted in avenues of orange trees, which were aligned with the columns of the mosque's interior. An under-<lb/>
ground cistern supplied the fountains and irrigation channels in this court, called the Patio de los Naranjos, or Court of the Oranges (fig. 3.6). Unfortunately, the underground cistern has long since been converted into an ossuary, and Christian chapels have filled in the arches that once opened onto this patio.</p>
<p>The Alc&#x00E1;zar<ref target="#CH3-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> in <name type="place">Seville</name>, which dates from about a hundred years after the Christian conquest of that city in <date when="1248">1248</date>, exemplifies the extensive Islamic influ-<lb/>

<p><name type="place">Granada</name> was the last Arabic city recaptured by Christian monarchs, falling to <name type="pname">Ferdinand</name> and <name type="pname">Isabel</name> <date when="1492">1492</date>. Its remaining Arabic gardens&#x2014;the <name type="place">Alhambra</name> and the Generalife&#x2014;which date from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, are among the oldest gardens in the world and enjoy legendary status. Sometime around <date when="1250">1250</date>, <name type="pname">Muhammad Ibn Ben Ahmar</name>, the founder of the <name type="place">Nasrid dynasty</name>, who took possession of <name type="place">Granada</name> in <date when="1238">1238</date>, climbed to the top of a bare red escarpment above the valley of the <name type="place">Darro</name> with the spectacular <name type="pname">Sierra Nevada</name> rising behind it and laid claim to a site for his palace where there was already standing a build-<lb/>
ing that probably served as a fortress in the late elev-<lb/>
enth century. Here he ordered the construction of an aqueduct, the water from which has made possible the gardens of the <name type="place">Alhambra</name> and the Generalife ever since. Built over a period of 250 years, principally during the reigns of <name type="pname">Yusuf I</name> (<date when="1333">1333</date>&#x2013;<date when="1354">1354</date>) and <name type="pname">Muhammad V</name> (<date when="1354">1354</date>&#x2013;<date when="1359">1359</date>; <date when="1362">1362</date>&#x2013;<date when="1391">1391</date>), the <name type="place">Alhambra</name>, like the Alc&#x00E1;zar in <name type="place">Seville</name>, is an accretion of enclosed garden spaces, some of which were torn away in the sixteenth century when <name type="pname">Charles V</name> built a vast square palace with a huge circular interior court.</p>
<p>At the <name type="place">Alhambra</name>, the planted areas of several of the enclosed gardens are defined by cross-axial paths. Soil beds were originally sunken well below these walkways and not as we see them today at almost the same grade. Planted with flowers, these garden courts would have been read by viewers sitting on carpets and low cushions placed in the surrounding porticoes as brightly colored tapestries. The fragrance of their orange trees, a unique garden design feature of Moor-<lb/>
ish <name type="place">Spain</name>, would have also perfumed the air. Because one rarely enters directly from the outside into a Span-<lb/>
ish-Moorish patio, but rather through a vestibule or twisting corridor, the sight of a beautiful interior gar-<lb/>
den is unexpected and therefore the impression it makes is powerful, relying as it does on one of the chief tricks of garden art: surprise. For instance, an undistin-<lb/>
guished opening off the Court of the Myrtles turns into a small dark corridor leading to the most famous and complex space within the <name type="place">Alhambra</name>, the Court of the Lions (fig. 3.8).</p>
<p>Here one finds a central fountain and a cruciform pattern of water channels. The fountain is supported by stylized lions with water flowing from their mouths into the basin below, which contemporaries may have linked symbolically with <name type="pname">Solomon</name>, or at least with the notion of wise royal rule associated with the Hebrew
<pb n="107"/>
<pb n="107" type="orig"/>
king.<ref target="#CH3-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> The basin is also fed by water that runs in a silver thread through the narrow white marble canals from the surrounding porticoed spaces. The most magnificent of these pavilionlike structures is the Hall of the Two Sisters flanking the Court of the Lions on the north. Its cupola of stucco blocks set over an octa-<lb/>
gon is formed into a honeycombed, stalactitelike ceil-<lb/>
ing of mesmerizing intricacy ascending as a symbolical representation of various levels of the heavens. Adding to the ethereal quality of the archi-<lb/>
tecture are slender alabaster columns, brilliant gild-<lb/>
ing, and polychrome tiles designed in a rich array of abstract patterns. Here one finds the familiar avoid-<lb/>
ance of figural imagery and Islamic preference for geometrical forms, believed to embody the mathe-<lb/>
matical order underlying all creation. For the same reason, topiary was scrupulously avoided and plants in this and other Islamic gardens were allowed to assume their natural forms.</p>

<p>On a nearby hillside is the Generalife, or <name type="pname">Jinnah al-'Arif</name>, as the summer palace of the Spanish Arabic kings was known when it was begun in <date when="1319">1319</date>. In addi-<lb/>
tion to the quiet beauty of its secluded interior garden courts, with their lush vegetation and clear pools of water, the Generalife captures within its scenic embrace the magnificent snow-capped <name type="pname">Sierra Nevada</name> as well as the picturesque towers of the <name type="place">Alhambra</name> silhouetted against the fertile valley of <name type="place">Granada</name> below. As in other Islamic gardens, the designers here used the musicality, reflectivity, and cooling charac-<lb/>
teristics of water to enhance sensory experience. The most prominent of the gardens of the Generalife, the Patio de Acequia, or Patio of the Canal, has, instead of the usual water cross-axis dividing it into four quadrants, a long narrow pool, bridged in the center, into which jets of water fall in arcs (fig. 3.9). These water jets, like the floral borders lining the edges of the marble pavement beside this pool, were probably
<pb n="108"/>
<pb n="108" type="orig"/>
sixteenth-century additions and appear somewhat flamboyant in the context of an Islamic garden. At its northern end, the Patio de Acequia_terminates in a pavilion, the delicacy of which has been compromised by the two stories added during the reign of <name type="pname">Isabella I</name> as queen of <name type="place">Castile</name>, <date when="1474">1474</date>&#x2013;<date when="1504">1504</date>; with <name type="pname">Ferdinand</name>, joint sovereign of <name type="place">Aragon</name> and <name type="place">Castile</name>, <date when="1479">1479</date>&#x2013;<date when="1504">1504</date>).</p>
<p>There were no kitchens or residential quarters at the Generalife. Used overnight only in summer, sleep-<lb/>
ers found rest cushions or couches in alcoves off the porticoes. Cooking was done on braziers in the galler-<lb/>
ies of pavilions or out-of-doors. In spirit then, if not exactly in plan, this garden was, like the Timu-rid gar-<lb/>
dens far to the east at the other end of the Islamic world, a paradisiacal campground for a people whose way of life was as closely related to landscape as to buildings.</p>

<p>From the <date when="1360">1360</date>s until his death in <date when="1405">1405</date>, the Turkish military genius <name type="pname">Timur</name>, or <name type="pname">Tamerlane</name> as he is known by Westerners, extended his conquests from the Mediter-<lb/>
ranean on the west to <name type="place">India</name> on the east and far into <name type="place">Russia</name>. He soon filled his Central Asian capital at <name type="place">Samarkand</name> in what is now modern <name type="place">Uzbekistan</name> with huge tile-decorated mosques and other buildings crammed with the plunder of his conquests. He espe-<lb/>
cially delighted in the creation of numerous pleasure gardens in the fertile valley around <name type="place">Samarkand</name>. Irri-<lb/>
gated by large water tanks, planted with fruit trees, sometimes furnished with dazzling tiled palace pavil-<lb/>
ions, and occupied by summer tent encampments, they were not so much tranquil refuges as magnificent places of pomp in which royal visitors were received and day-to-day business was conducted. Carpets and pillows were spread beneath embroidered silk cano-<lb/>
pies. At festivals, servants passed great leather trays heaped with roasted horsemeat, boiled mutton, spicy rice dishes, and fresh fruit among hundreds of richly dressed, bejeweled courtiers.<ref target="#CH3-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The Timurid conquest of <name type="place">Central Asia</name> was the foundation from which the Mughal Empire sprang. The high-walled gardens of <name type="place">Samarkand</name>, filled with fruit trees and wild game, inspired <name type="pname">Timur</name>'s descendant <name type="pname">Babur</name> (<date when="1483">1483</date>&#x2013;<date when="1530">1530</date>), the founder of the Mughal dynasty, to build similar gardens at <name type="place">Kabul</name> in what is now modern <name type="place">Afghanistan</name> and at <name type="place">Agra</name> in northern <name type="place">India</name>. Also inspirational for <name type="pname">Babur</name> were the gardens at Herat in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>, which he visited in the autumn of <date when="1506">1506</date>. There he experienced firsthand the pleasures of sophis-<lb/>
ticated courtly life in a garden setting. Recollecting Herat and the loveliness of the garden city of <name type="place">Samar-<lb/>
kand</name>, and understanding, too, the garden's political significance as a way of claiming territory, asserting legitimacy, and maintaining power, he laid out numer-<lb/>
ous gardens high in the mountains at <name type="place">Kabul</name>. There, well-watered hillsides were covered with bunch grasses and spotted with masses of wild native tulips in the spring. In this choice natural setting, <name type="pname">Babur</name> chan-<lb/>
neled natural springs into stone-lined reservoirs sur-<lb/>
mounted by platforms, and then planted many fruit trees. A typical Mughal garden can thus be envisioned in plan as an enclosed space divided into quarters, with a central water axis, a water-<lb/>
surrounded platform for one or more structures (pal-<lb/>
aces or pavilions) located in the center, and a mixture of vineyard, orchard, and flowers.</p>
<p>In the gardens of <name type="place">Kabul</name>, <name type="pname">Babur</name> entertained his warrior-nobles, planned military campaigns, cele-<lb/>
brated important events, held public audiences, com-<lb/>
posed music, and wrote poetry. The garden, in effect, became the royal court, not an adjunct to it. Although <name type="pname">Babur</name>'s successors later built fortified palaces in vari-<lb/>
ous urban centers, the festive tents and light, airy pavil-<lb/>
ions that stood upon the geometrically designed, water-laced terraces of <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">chahar baghs</hi></name>, as these quadri-<lb/>
partite compartmentalized Timurid gardens were called, remained important venues of court life.<ref target="#CH3-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><name type="pname">Babur</name> built the Bagh-i-Vafa, or Garden of Fidelity, on an elevated site overlooking the Sorkhrud river. This garden is depicted at a greatly compressed scale in the <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">Babur-Nama</hi></name>, the illustrated manuscript of <name type="pname">Babur</name>'s memoirs commissioned by his grandson, the emperor <name type="pname">Akbar</name> (ruled <date when="1556">1556</date>&#x2013;<date when="1605">1605</date>). These paintings show run-<lb/>
nels carrying water from canals to irrigate fruit trees. Here <name type="pname">Babur</name> and his followers could walk among the flowering branches or sit beneath a silken tent or pavil-<lb/>
ion raised upon a <hi rend="italic">chabutra</hi>, a central square stone plat-<lb/>
form, above the four symbolical "rivers" that flowed beneath it (fig. 3.10). <name type="pname">Babur</name> is known to have stopped and camped here frequently with his retinue, sometimes in autumn when the pomegranates ripened.</p>
<p>As <name type="pname">Babur</name> visited the various villages in the coun-<lb/>
tryside around <name type="place">Kabul</name> and the cities en route to it, such as <name type="place">Jalalabad</name>, he frequently directed that his stopping places be laid out as gardens. Garden building and his constant movement from one garden encampment to another were important politically. His appearance in force with his armed retainers and the garden entertain-<lb/>
ments he organized helped him to assert his dominance as <hi rend="italic">Padshah</hi>, or protecting overlord, among rebellious clans.</p>
<p>It was not an easy task. <name type="pname">Babur</name> was confronted by the growing power of the Uzbeks to the north. On the east he was hemmed in by the <name type="place">Himalayas</name> and on the west by the emergent power of the Safavid dynasty in <name type="place">Persia</name>. As Timurid refugees crowded into <name type="place">Kabul</name> fol-<lb/>
lowing the capture of <name type="place">Samarkand</name> by the Uzbeks, there was only one direction in which <name type="pname">Babur</name> could turn: to the south and Hindustan, or northern <name type="place">India</name>.</p>

<p>In <date when="1526">1526</date>, after the Battle of <name type="place">Panipat</name>, where he defeated the <name type="place">Delhi</name> sultanate representing a collection of earlier Muslim dynasties that had consolidated power in northern <name type="place">India</name>, he was able to proclaim him-<lb/>
self <hi rend="italic">Padshah</hi> there. To solidify his triumph, he claimed for his court the former capital of the <name type="place">Delhi</name> sultanate at <name type="place">Agra</name> on the Yamuna River. In spite&#x2014;or perhaps because&#x2014;of its dry climate and harsh scenery, which filled him with disgust, he immediately set about rep-<lb/>
licating the gardens he had left behind in <name type="place">Kabul</name>. Indeed, the riverside gardens he built at <name type="place">Agra</name> were referred to as "<name type="place">Kabul</name>." And it was from this garden setting, rather than from the fortress across the river, that <name type="pname">Babur</name> ruled, once more establishing the <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">chahar bagh</hi></name> as a place of state.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, garden designers employed water in highly imaginative ways. On the plains of <name type="place">India</name>, where there were fewer mountain cascades than in <name type="place">Kabul</name>, they had to develop elaborate hydrological measures in order to furnish water channels and irrigate
<pb n="110"/>
<pb n="110" type="orig"/>
vegetation. Early Mughal gardens were supplied by ox-driven <hi rend="italic">norias</hi>. A basin, often octagonal in shape, received water from the tank and distributed it into the channels of the garden as well as into cisterns and baths. Later, engineers were able to provide water more copi-<lb/>
ously by constructing canals that tapped major rivers. Then it was possible to widen narrow channels into true watercourses and install fountains and <hi rend="italic">chadars</hi>&#x2014;masonry ramps carved in a faceted pattern in order to enliven the movement of water and increase the sparkle of refracted light.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Gardens of <name type="place">Kashmir</name></hi></hi></head>
<p>After <date when="1586">1586</date>, when <name type="pname">Babur</name>'s grandson <name type="pname">Akbar</name> conquered <name type="place">Kashmir</name> in the well-watered foothills of the Hima-layas, Mughal garden builders were able to freely exploit the sensuosity of water. To this favored locale of summer retreat, <name type="pname">Akbar</name> and his successors <name type="pname">Jahangir</name> (ruled <date when="1605">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1627">1627</date>) and <name type="pname">Shah Jahan</name> (ruled 1627&#x2013;<date when="1658">1658</date>), with their vast retinues of soldiers, horses, mules, and royal ladies borne in litters on the backs of elephants, made epic journeys from the hot, dry northern plains of <name type="place">India</name>. They traveled through hazardous mountain passes in late winter in order to arrive in time to enjoy the wildflower meadows of spring.</p>
<p>At least three of <name type="pname">Jahangir</name>'s gardens in <name type="place">Kashmir</name> still exist, the most important of which is Shalamar (the Abode of Love), a terraced garden he began laying out in <date when="1619">1619</date> in the foothills of the mountains overlooking Lake Dal (fig. 3.11). Here <name type="pname">Jahangir</name>'s engineers diverted a stream and directed the water into a broad central canal running the length of the entire garden. Shalamar originally com-<lb/>
prised three square terraces, each with a <hi rend="italic">baradari</hi>, or open-sided pavilion placed on a stone platform set in the water at the point where the canal widens to form a square pool. In passing over the garden's succession of low ter-<lb/>
race retaining walls before emptying in the lake, the canal forms a series of cascades. A line of water jets reinforces the principal axis of the canal, and in each pool more jets animate its surface. Regularly planted plane trees further emphasize Shalamar's geometrical <hi rend="italic">char-bagh</hi> layout while providing welcome shade.</p>
<p>The lowest terrace (now truncated by a modern road) is a public space dominated by the <hi rend="italic">Diwan-i-Am</hi>, or Hall of Public Audience, where the emperor received peti-<lb/>
tioners. Above it stands the emperor's garden; its central pavilion was the <hi rend="italic">Diwan-i-Khas</hi>, or Hall of Private Audi-<lb/>
ence (now vanished except for the low black marble
<pb n="111"/>
<pb n="111" type="orig"/>
throne), where members of the court were admitted (fig. 3.12). Above this is the harem garden. It is deeply shaded by two rows of plane trees, and its entrance is guarded by two small symmetrical pavilions. Where the harem garden meets the emperor's garden, horizon-<lb/>
tal slits in the stonework allow the water to flow into side pools and from these, through further slits, down into the canal in a shimmering veil over the side walls of the twin platforms flanking the cascade. In the center of a large square pool with fountain sprays, accessible only by two causeways, stands the open-sided Black Pavilion, believed to have been used as a banqueting hall (fig. 3.13). Here lateral canals create the cruciform plan of a true paradise garden, confirming the inscrip-<lb/>
tion on the pavilion: "If there is a paradise on the face of the earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."</p>
<p>Mughal garden designers were ingenious in devising ways to enhance the garden's paradisiacal atmosphere through the sensuous manipulation of water. For instance, where the water in the central canal at Shalamar drops over the retaining walls of the ter-<lb/>
races, its force projects it beyond the coping; here in the face of the wall beneath the coping, stone carvers cut small niches resembling pigeonholes, and in these ser-<lb/>
vants placed flowers on important occasions. Called <hi rend="italic">chini kanas</hi>, they also contained oil lamps to illuminate the flowing water at night.</p>
<p>In other Kashmiri gardens such as Achbal and Nishat Bagh, also on Lake Dal, <hi rend="italic">chadars</hi> enliven the passage of water wherever grade changes occur (fig. 3.14). Contrasting with the sparkle and roar of <hi rend="italic">chadars</hi>, there are serene pools. At <name type="place">Vernag</name>, located near the Banihal Pass to the Indian plain, the beauty of the site was such that only a spring-fed octagonal basin was added. From its outfall, a 1,000-foot-long canal stretches through a meadow to empty in a mountain stream beside a cedar-clad slope.</p>

<p>The fourfold garden, elaborated by a grid of canals with <hi rend="italic">chabutras</hi> at their intersections, remained a constant form during 150 years of Mughal garden development. In the great imperial tomb gardens of the sixteenth cen-<lb/>
tury the <hi rend="italic">chabutra</hi> at the principal intersection was transformed from a mere platform into the base of a magnificent monument. Unlike the royal pleasure gar-<lb/>
dens at <name type="place">Kashmir</name>, which were terraced, with social func-<lb/>
tions assigned to each ascending level, the tomb gardens are essentially flat with only the mildest grade change to permit the gravitational flow of water throughout a grid of narrow watercourses. Water col-<lb/>
lects in the square pools and octagonal basins placed at intersections within the subdivided square grid that surrounds a central square platform. This platform&#x2014;or large-scale <hi rend="italic">chabutra</hi>&#x2014;serves as the base for an impres-<lb/>
sive mausoleum, which is often decorated with a col-<lb/>
orful inlay of semiprecious stones.</p>
<p>The first departure from the relatively modest tombs of Islamic rulers, begun in <date when="1564">1564</date>, was that of <name type="pname">Babur</name>'s successor, his aesthetically sensitive, supersti-<lb/>
tious, and pleasure-loving eldest son <name type="pname">Humayun</name>, who assumed the throne at the age of twenty-two following the great emperor's death in <date when="1530">1530</date>. The Islamic garden historian <name type="pname">James L. Wescoat</name> sums up his role as an urbanist:
<q>
<p>When <name type="pname">Humayun</name> built his palace in <name type="place">Agra Fort</name> and his city in <name type="place">Delhi</name>, he initiated a process of urban-<lb/>
ization which radically altered the meaning and function of gardens in Mughal culture. <name type="pname">Babur</name> had shunned the citadels he conquered. For reasons unknown but perhaps harkening back to the Timurid ideal of Samarquand in the 14th century, <name type="pname">Humayun</name> began to recenter Mughal social life within citadels, ornamenting and surrounding them with gardens.<ref target="#CH3-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q></p>
<p>His widow, <name type="pname">Haji Begum</name>, commissioned the construc-<lb/>
tion of his mausoleum, which is characterized by another Mughal garden scholar, <name type="pname">Elizabeth Moynihan</name>, as being like a cosmic mountain above the four rivers of paradise represented by the garden's four water channels.<ref target="#CH3-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Inlaid stone and marble were the materials with which <name type="pname">Shah Jahan</name> built the Taj Mahal in honor of his adored wife <name type="pname">Mumtaz-i-Mahal</name> (Chosen One of the Pal-<lb/>
ace), who died in <date when="1631">1631</date> as she was bearing their four-<lb/>
teenth child (figs. 3.15, 3.16). Begun on the banks of the Jamuna in <name type="place">Agra</name> the following year, construction continued for the next sixteen. Like other monumental Mughal mausoleums, the Taj Mahal is set within a <hi rend="italic">char bagh;</hi> however, instead of occupying the traditional space at the intersection of the garden's four principal canals, the extended <hi rend="italic">chabutra</hi> supporting the mauso-<lb/>
leum was placed at the far end following the pattern to be seen at other riverfront gardens at <name type="place">Agra</name>, which has the effect of ensuring that the unforgettable lines of the remarkable structure are always seen against the sky. The tall minarets have been pulled away from the cor-<lb/>
ners of the building and set at the edge of the terrace upon which the building rests, and this ingeniously enlarges the space occupied by the building, while at the same time lightening its apparent mass. Its sky-catching dome and minarets and the well-propor-<lb/>
tioned central canal mirroring it in the water demateri-<lb/>
alize its obvious mass.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-106">

<p>Considered by many as the apotheosis of Mughal culture, the Taj Mahal is also its last important creative achievement. <name type="pname">Shah Jahan</name>, who had killed his brother to secure the throne, was deposed in <date when="1658">1658</date> by his son <name type="pname">Aurangzeb</name>, who in turn had already killed his three brothers. <name type="pname">Aurangzeb</name> had his father imprisoned in the <name type="place">Red Fort</name> on the other side of the river within sight of the

Although the Mughal dynasty, which had been founded by <name type="pname">Babur</name> and secured in power by <name type="pname">Akbar</name>, continued to exist until overthrown by British rule in the nineteenth century, <name type="pname">Aurangzeb</name>'s religious fanati-<lb/>
cism and subsequent wars of succession depleted the resources of empire beyond recovery. The great period of Mughal architecture and garden building was over. Islamic culture, however, continued to flourish else-<lb/>
where, notably in and around <name type="pname">Constantinople</name> after the conquest of the <name type="place">Byzantine Empire</name> by the <name type="pname">Ottoman Turks</name>, and in <name type="place">Persia</name> after the restoration of its autonomy in the sixteenth century.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Turkish Gardens</hi></hi></head>
<p>The <name type="pname">Ottoman Turks</name>, a tribal people of <name type="place">Central Asia</name>, adopted Islam in the ninth century. They were used as mercenaries by both the <name type="pname">Abbasid</name> caliphs and the <name type="pname">Saljuq Turks</name>. One of the <name type="pname">Ottoman</name> warrior tribes that served the <name type="pname">Saljuqs</name> migrated into <name type="place">Asia Minor</name> in the thirteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. As <name type="place">Mongol</name> invaders undermined <name type="pname">Saljuq</name> authority in <date when="1253">1253</date>, the <name type="pname">Ottomans</name> established autonomy and initi-<lb/>
ated their own program of conquest, eventually captur-<lb/>
ing <name type="pname">Constantinople</name> in <date when="1453">1453</date>. Their victorious leader, <name type="pname">Mehmed II</name> (ruled <date when="1444">1444</date>&#x2013;<date when="1446">1446</date>; <date when="1451">1451</date>&#x2013;<date when="1481">1481</date>), renamed it <name type="place">Istanbul</name>.</p>
<p>On the ancient <name type="place">Byzantine</name> acropolis overlooking the <name type="pname">Bosporus</name> to the north and the <name type="place">Sea of Marmara</name> to the south, <name type="pname">Mehmed II</name> built the Topkapi Saray, a vast palace and garden complex, the design of which expressed an elaborate code of <name type="pname">Ottoman</name> courtly ritual and protocol. Removed from the crowded center of the city and sur-<lb/>
rounded by water on two sides and a high wall on the third, it furnished the sultan with the necessary condition of seclusion within a sanctified paradisiacal enclosure.</p>
<p>Because the sultan's orbit was strictly limited by the mystique of his inaccessibility, he depended more than other rulers did on his palace and grounds for visual stimulation and entertainment. Most of his life was spent within an inner court in sumptuously furnished apart-<lb/>
ments, library, and delightful gardens. An outer garden was planned both as an important personal statement in which the themes of power, pleasure, and paradise were interwoven and to serve as a great amusement park con-<lb/>
taining multiple stratagems to combat the boredom of a circumscribed existence.</p>
<p>Life at Topkapi centered around courtyards and gardens, pools and fountains, orchards and vineyards, harem, mosques, baths, kitchens, stables, offices, bar-<lb/>
racks, schools, and armory. Within its precincts, which were divided into men's and women's quarters, a strictly organized social hierarchy prevailed. At the top, power-<lb/>
ful viziers, representing the omnipresent but secluded sultan, conducted affairs of state and meted out justice in the name of the powerful ruler.</p>
<p>The Topkapi Saray, as it evolved in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, consisted of three large contig-<lb/>
uous, but not axially arranged, courts outlined by func-<lb/>
tional groupings of buildings. In addition, there were appended to the third court a private hanging garden, sometimes referred to as a fourth court, and a large exte-<lb/>
rior garden with terraces spreading to the <name type="pname">Bosporus</name> and the <name type="place">Sea of Marmara</name>. Within the exterior garden, various areas were set aside for such recreational pursuits as jav-<lb/>
elin throwing, polo, archery, hunting, and other royal pastimes. Here, too, were several kiosks for scenic view-<lb/>
ing and other pastimes.</p>
<p>The first court at Topkapi Saray was known as the Court of Processions after the processional thoroughfare leading from the <name type="pname">Hagia Sophia</name> through its imposing arched Imperial Gate. It was an open, uncluttered cere-<lb/>
monial space, less distinguished by its loosely organized surrounding architecture than by the bejeweled pomp of finely decorated horses and cavalry and the spectacle of exotic animals exhibited there on occasion. At the sec-<lb/>
ond monumental gate, which stood at the far end of the first court, those mounted on horses, with the exception of the sultan, were forced to dismount, and protocol demanded silence upon passing through its vestibule into the second court.</p>
<p>Inside, the second court proved to be an idyllic gar-<lb/>
den surrounded by a stately marble colonnade. Birds sang in the tall cypresses and other trees, and ostriches, pea-<lb/>
cocks, deer, and gazelles wandered on lawns behind red-<lb/>
painted wooden fences. Paths fanned out to the gates of various functional quarters&#x2014;commissary, kitchens, con-<lb/>
fectionery&#x2014;as well as to a range of administrative cham-<lb/>
bers&#x2014;Council Hall, chancery, archives, and treasury. At the far end of this court rose its architectural focus, the third gate, called the Gate of Felicity. Its domed canopy denoted the presence of the sultan just beyond within the third court, the private sanctum of the usually invisible ruler.</p>
<p>The third court, reserved for the royal family and inner household, as well as for the students who were being trained as the future <name type="pname">Ottoman</name> administrative elite, was sumptuously decorated. Ranging along its south-<lb/>
western side was the harem where the sultan's female family members and children lived, as well as their women attendants, servants, and the distaff administra-<lb/>
tors of these quarters. Here, as elsewhere in the vast sprawling complex, there were gardens. These included a large pool overlooking a boxwood garden and another extensive garden for the exclusive use of the women and the sultan.</p>
<p>In the sultan's private garden the Islamic genius for interweaving architecture and garden space was given full play. Here, freed from the rules of ceremony and the
<pb n="115"/>
<pb n="115" type="orig"/>
protocol of aloof reserve demanded of him, the sultan could indulge the emotional side of his nature, writing poetry, enjoying music, reading, dining with male or female companions, or watching the sporting contests below in the outer garden.</p>
<p>There were alcoves furnished with low pillowed sofas in the large, airy, luxuriously decorated <name type="pname">Revan</name> and <name type="pname">Baghdad kiosks</name> (fig. 3.17). Placed under the domes of these pavilions and within window recesses, foun-<lb/>
tains added their agreeable murmur and sparkle to the luminous interiors. Bronze fireplaces provided comfort in winter, and canvas shades lowered by pulleys pro-<lb/>
vided privacy as well as shade from the summer sun. Set upon a marble platform beside a large reflecting pool, such fantastical structures appeared to hover in space.</p>
<p>In such an environment it is not surprising that the most sensuously appealing flowers and fruits were planted. <name type="pname">Sultan S&#x00FC;leyman</name>'s account book of <date when="1564">1564</date>&#x2013;<date when="1565">65</date> refers to an orange grove, potted jasmine, and a field of carnations, while a later record speaks of renewing the jasmine pergolas near the terrace of the House of Felic-<lb/>
ity. Fruit trees of several varieties abounded, and according to the report of one foreign visitor, grapes were grown throughout the year.</p>
<p>Greco-Roman ruins were turned to good account. Many antique sarcophagi had been converted by <name type="pname">Mehmed II</name> into fountain basins, and the large Goth's Column commemorating a Roman victory against their ancient northern foes was left standing in the parklike outer garden a short distance from the gate that con-<lb/>
nected it with the hanging garden, or fourth court.</p>
<p>Extending to the shores of the triangular promon-<lb/>
tory, the outer garden consisted of a series of stepped terraces built over vaulted substructures, some of which incorporated the ruins of the <name type="place">Byzantine</name> acropolis. With its flowing fountains, fertile vineyards, beds of flowers, domed pavilions, sparkling pools, comely pages, and beautiful concubines, it must have appeared as a phys-<lb/>
ical manifestation of paradise as described in the Quran. In addition to serving as a botanical garden for a multitude of rare and delightful plants, the large outer garden also acted as a game preserve and zoological garden for many wild and domesticated animals, water-<lb/>
fowl, and songbirds.</p>
<p>Stretching outward from the medieval <name type="place">Byzantine</name> seawall, four seaside kiosks embraced the extraordi-<lb/>
nary view and provided delightful haunts wherein suc-<lb/>
cessive sultans could indulge in courtly pastimes in the company of pages, dwarfs, concubines, and an occa-<lb/>
sional visiting scholar or potentate. There were other garden kiosks beside the <name type="pname">Bosporus</name> in addition to those of Topkapi. Much admired by travelers to <name type="place">Turkey</name> in the eighteenth century for its curved dome, patterned tiles, and inlay work of marble, granite, and porphyry, the <name type="pname">Ottoman</name> kiosk was often replicated, using less opulent materials, in later Western gardens.</p>

<p>Turkish gardens were also renowned for their extensive use of fountains. Some fountains were upright and meant to imitate the Fountain of Salsabil in the Quran, with water dripping as gently as tears from one scalloped cup into another in a series projecting from a carved marble slab. Others were noisier and provided a screen for confidential conversation. There were also, wherever necessary, ablution pools, which were usually square or rectangular basins. Thus was <name type="pname">Ottoman</name> wealth lavished upon garden art and the ideal of paradise made real.</p>

lords. Ten years after ascending the throne, he began to manifest <name type="place">Persia</name>'s re-established autonomy and wealth with the building of a new capital, <name type="place">Isfahan</name>, adjacent to the site of an ancient <name type="place">Achaemenid</name> city and elev-<lb/>

In <date when="1598-03">March 1598</date>, <name type="pname">Shah Abbas</name> traveled from his capital at Qazvin to his palace in the ancient city of <name type="place">Isfahan</name> for the spring celebration of the Persian New Year when wildflowers briefly bloom on the high Iranian plain. With its views of lavender-colored mountains and green fields, gar-<lb/>
dens, and orchards running down to the Zaindeh River, <name type="place">Isfahan</name> furnished a spectacular site in which <name type="pname">Shah Abbas</name> could create an imperial garden city. Construc-<lb/>
tion began immediately to the south of the old town, and garden pavilions, shops, and caravansaries were erected along with public baths, schools, and mosques. An intricate terraced irrigation system was built to carry a canal the length of the 150-foot-wide (45.7-meter-wide) <name type="pname">Chahar Bagh Avenue</name>, so named because it served as the connecting spine and water

<p>By the second half of the seventeenth century, <name type="place">Isfa-<lb/>
han</name> was at the height of its splendor, with a population numbering 600,000. Its plan from that period shows, to the south of the tangle of streets and welter of buildings in the old town, three main axial arrangements: the <name type="pname">May-<lb/>
dan-e-Shah</name>, or Imperial Square with its surrounding shops and royal palace on the west, the <name type="pname">Chahar Bagh Avenue</name>, and the mosques aligned to face <name type="place">Mecca</name> in con-<lb/>
formity with universal Islamic practice.</p>
<p>The chief public ground was the <name type="pname">Maydan-e-Shah</name>. Measuring approximately 1664 feet by 517 feet (507 meters by 158 meters), it served as a versatile recre-<lb/>
ational field and a place of pomp, pageantry, and public executions. This great Imperial Square was enclosed by a uniform two-story arcade housing the shops of mer-<lb/>
chants dealing in precious gems, gold, silk, and medici-<lb/>
nal drugs. Within the square itself, tents and awnings were thrown up on weekly market days for dealers sell-<lb/>
ing furs, jewelry, and pearls as well as for traders of cloth, spices, vegetables, and fruit. At such times, it was a place for prostitutes to solicit business and for jugglers, tightrope walkers, acrobats, magicians, and wrestlers to entertain crowds. Spectacular punishments took place there, providing whatever moral instruction was intended as well as satisfying the human appetite for cruelty. From a great platform supported by eighteen pillars behind the Ali Qapu, or Lofty Gateway, on the western side of the <name type="pname">Maydan-e-Shah</name>, the <name type="pname">Shah</name> and his retinue could watch polo, a game native to the Middle East, and many lively tournaments featuring feats of derring-do similar to the events of a contemporary rodeo.</p>

<p>The Imperial Mosque was built at the southern end of the <name type="pname">Maydan-e-Shah</name> in <date when="1612">1612</date>. Because its plan was rotated to orient the mosque toward <name type="place">Mecca</name>, <name type="pname">Shah Abbas</name>'s architects had to resolve the structural transi-<lb/>
tion between the Maydan and the mosque. This was done with the construction of a portal, an open vesti-<lb/>
bule, and two stories of <hi rend="italic">iwans</hi>, the large nichelike vaults originally conceived by the Parthians, fully developed by Sasanian architects, and deployed here and else-<lb/>
where throughout the Islamic world. This mosque is a dazzling display of Persian architectural genius. Multi-<lb/>
colored tiles, predominantly light and dark blue, cover interior walls as well as the exterior of the large dome in a richly interlacing pattern, their intricate reflective surfaces dematerializing the solid masonry beneath them.</p>
<p>Imperial storerooms and the workshops for arti-<lb/>
sans engaged in the production of fine embroideries, rugs, illuminated manuscripts, jewelry, and other pre-<lb/>
cious objects lay within the palace grounds. Instead of a single large palace, <name type="pname">Shah Abbas</name> built several garden pavilions and palaces, such as the <name type="pname">Chehel Sotun</name>, or Hall of Forty Columns, with its great open porch and easy interpenetration of outdoor and indoor living spaces (fig. 3.19). Two large square fountains guarded by four water-spouting lions were set into the floor of the great porch. The ethereal character of this structure was enhanced by brightly painted wood mosaic inlaid with mirrors as well as by its tranquil, reflective pools of water.</p>
<p>Anchored on the north by the palace grounds, the <name type="pname">Chahar Bagh Avenue</name> runs along a slightly sloping grade for nearly a mile to the river, then across a two-<lb/>
story arcaded bridge to terminate on the south in the huge royal estate known as the <name type="pname">Hezar Jarib</name>. One-hun-<lb/>
dred-eighty-feet (55-meters) wide, the Avenue was planted in <name type="pname">Shah Abbas</name>'s time with eight rows of plane trees and poplars, with roses and jasmine growing in between them. Five runnels of water divided the ave-<lb/>
nue. The large central one was lined with onyx and punctuated at each change of water level with individ-<lb/>
ually designed square or oct-agonal pools and foun-<lb/>
tains. Gardens built by courtiers and rich merchants bordered this promenade on either side. These were entered through small pavilions. Larger pavilions with such evocative names as Garden of the Vineyard, Mul-<lb/>
berry Garden, and Garden of the Nightingale stood in the center of each. Passersby on the <name type="pname">Chahar Bagh Ave-<lb/>
nue</name> could glimpse these now mostly vanished gardens through latticework walls and, for a small price, gain entrance. Tantalizing descriptions of their contents come from visitors to the Safavid court.</p>

<p>After the fall of the western provinces of the Roman Empire in the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, followed by the advance of Islam in the Mediterranean basin, civiliza-<lb/>
tion became more highly regionalized throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>. Without centralized administration over these former imperial territories, the great road and aqueduct systems built by the ancient Romans fell into partial disuse and extensive disrepair, and as we shall see in Chapter Four, the capital itself shrank within its walls. The disruption caused by successive challenges to cen-<lb/>
tralized power produced new kinds of reciprocal rela-<lb/>
tionships in relation to land tenure, an economic and social system often characterized as "feudal."</p>
<p>Like <name type="pname">C&#x00F3;rdoba</name> and the Islamic centers of learning, monasteries continued to serve as repositories of knowledge, and many ancient Roman towns were per-<lb/>
petuated as episcopal seats. The Carolingian period, lasting from the middle of the eighth century into the tenth century, helped to reanimate in a limited fashion some of the grandeur of ancient Roman cities, which now served as the fortified settlements and seats of bishops and counts. The Cistercian monastic revival of the eleventh century promoted agricultural improve-<lb/>
ments, which in turn stimulated the regrowth of cities. By the middle of the eleventh century, revived mari-<lb/>
time trade boosted the fortunes of <name type="place">Genoa</name>, <name type="place">Pisa</name>, and <name type="place">Venice</name>, which began its dazzling rise from watery ref-<lb/>
uge to immensely prosperous mercantile center. In the Low Countries and along the Baltic and North Sea coasts as well as in the valleys of the Rh&#x00F4;ne, Rhine, and Danube, conditions were also favorable for the rise of towns as centers of production and trade. <name type="pname">Constan-<lb/>
tinople</name>, capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, remained an important center for crafts manufacture and the international exchange of goods, and this was a stimulus to trade in the West.</p>
<p>In the late Middle Ages, beginning in the elev-<lb/>
enth century and accelerating as <name type="place">Europe</name> recovered from the effects of the Black Death in the middle of the fourteenth century, there was a revival of trade and the emergence of banking houses. This was coupled with a wary but growing conviction on the part of feudal lords that a stimulus to their own prosperity lay in franchises granted to independent towns from which they could obtain handsome revenues. Seeking greater independence from feudal lords, townspeople formed trade guilds and municipal councils. As a powerful merchant class came into being and cities became more prosperous through trade, their jeal-<lb/>
ously guarded privileges exempted them from control by the Church or local barons. Our survey of Euro-<lb/>
pean cities in the Middle Ages is necessarily limited to this last late flowering of urbanism during the period often termed <hi rend="italic">Gothic</hi> and comprising roughly the late twelfth through the fifteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Like most cities heretofore throughout history, these medieval ones were necessarily walled for rea-<lb/>
sons of defense. Girdled towns stood in stony contrast to their surrounding fields. Towered castles and church spires etched their profiles on the otherwise unpunctuated skyline. The inward-focused peristyle garden of <name type="place">Rome</name> became the medieval cloister garden, a paradisiacal jewel within the bosom of the monastic precinct. This stout containment of various units of the built environment, with some walled structures nest-<lb/>
ing within others, was obviously done for reasons of security. But such enclosure can also be read as an expression of the way in which medieval intellectuals sought to order knowledge within a self-contained framework.</p>
<p>The Dominican monk <name type="pname">Thomas Aquinas</name> (<date when="1225">1225</date>&#x2013;<date when="1274">1274</date>), the most influential theologian and philosopher of the Late Middle Ages, brought Christian doctrine and Aristotelian logic into a syncretic intellectual sys-<lb/>
tem. By inquiring into the nature of nature, he laid the foundations of the scientific revolution. His approach to knowledge was not one of open-ended speculation, but rather one that attempted to order all knowledge into a comprehensive, God-ordained harmony of parts, or <hi rend="italic">summa</hi>. Although it served as an expandable framework, <name type="pname">Aquinas</name>'s system was, like that of <name type="pname">Aristo-<lb/>
tle</name>, a closed one based on the notion of an Aristotelian
<pb n="119"/>
<pb n="119" type="orig"/>
geocentric universe in which all matter was spherically contained within Earth and its surrounding atmosphere and all contents ultimately knowable.</p>
<p>The Late Middle Ages was a period in which reli-<lb/>
gious allegory flourished and sharp distinctions were drawn between good and evil, heaven and hell, human and divine. Paradise was an ever present and almost palpable cultural concept. But the route to paradise lay through earthly travail and self-denial, and the blessed abode necessarily remained an invisible vision, a viv-<lb/>
idly imagined reward for faith and endurance of the trials of this life. Virtues and vices were personified and paired in opposition to one another. This Christian the-<lb/>
ology was illuminated in manuscripts, carved in the stones of cathedrals, fashioned into stained-glass win-<lb/>
dows, and depicted in fresco and mosaic on wall sur-<lb/>
faces.</p>
<p>The great epic poem of the period, <name type="pname">Dante</name>'s <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy</hi> of <date when="1321">1321</date>, joined Christian theology and classical astronomy into a vast symbolic structure. <name type="pname">Dante</name>'s reordering of pagan cosmology into a moral drama was, like the system of <name type="pname">Aquinas</name>, both all-em-<lb/>
bracing and self-contained. Since Christian teaching encouraged the sublimation of sexual desire to reli-<lb/>
gious belief, <name type="pname">Dante</name>'s <name type="pname">Beatrice</name> is an ideal of virtuous womanhood, his virginal guide to paradise. As in the <hi rend="italic">Romance of the Rose</hi>, physical love in <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy</hi> is hedged in, contained, like a garden sur-<lb/>
rounded by a high wall or fence. The concept of enclo-<lb/>
sure was so inherent a part of the medieval garden that a gate and fence, with only a few rudimentary plants inside, became its convenient graphic symbol (see fig. 3.2).</p>
<p>Although the values that the late medieval world portrayed were decidedly spiritual, the period was remarkably full of worldly energy and new advances in technology. Entrepreneurial capitalism had begun to supersede feudalism. Human nature asserted itself lust-<lb/>
fully as well as spiritually, and gardens served not only as symbolical representations of paradise but also as aristocratic preserves for lovemaking. Horticulture as a craft was re-established, and the foundations of Renaissance science and humanism were laid as this cultural era drew to its dynamic close.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Walled Cities</hi></hi></head>
<p>More than merely defensive units for the protection of local populations, the European walled cities of the Late Middle Ages were active centers to which the privilege of entry for the purpose of doing business was granted to outsiders. Toll revenues collected at their gates from peasant farmers coming to market or merchants from abroad formed a substantial part of their wealth. Their organic growth patterns along major routes within and immediately outside their walls reflect the burgeoning medieval market economy.</p>

The military technology that occasioned the construction of walls as earth-works and bastions with arrow-headlike projections did not occur until the sixteenth century. At that time, cannon fire rendered obsolete high crenellated walls and machicolated towers with floor openings from which molten lead, boiling oil, or missiles could be dropped on attackers advancing with battering rams.</figDesc>

<p>Because the growing towns existed as islands within the uncertain seas of feudal combat and local rebellion, their safety depended upon high, thick walls with crenellations, which shielded the archers defend-<lb/>
ing them (fig. 3.20). Round or square towers punctuated these walls at intervals of every hundred feet or so. Small openings cut into the towers permitted a wide range of crossfire when a town was under siege. Gates, the necessary portals of the city, were inevitably the weak points of a town wall. They were therefore doubly guarded by massive flanking towers. Because towns often grew on both sides of a river, the two ends where the river bisected the walls also received additional for-<lb/>
tification in the form of strong towers, as did the ends of bridges leading to walled towns built on a single riv-<lb/>
erbank (fig. 3.21). Not all of the newly created towns that sprang up in the eleventh-and twelfth-century urban revolution were initially built with these walls. But for successful towns, particularly those that devel-<lb/>
oped under royal or ecclesiastical aegis, investment in massive fortifications was imperative.</p>

<figDesc>3.22. <name type="place">Campo</name>, <name type="place">Siena</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>Inasmuch as the construction of monumental walls and towers represented public works projects of considerable magnitude, medieval cities were usually made as compact as possible in order to minimize their circumference and hence the extent of their perimeter fortifications. This and the imperatives of the city's market economy dictated a rounded urban form with radial streets emanating from a central square and trading area to its several gates. In former Roman colonial cities, these radial thoroughfares simply surrounded and fed into the grid with its ancient <hi rend="italic">cardo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">decumanus</hi> and became organi-<lb/>
cally integrated with its pre-existing street pattern (see fig. 2.23). Around the central market square, town halls were built when the administrative func-<lb/>
tions of increasingly complex urban units made civil governance a necessity. In the jockeying for position within the medieval city, in which site occupancy denoted relative degrees of urban power, the most powerful guild halls received greater centrality. The cloth hall wherein the wool trade&#x2014;the mainstay of the medieval economy&#x2014;was conducted, often boasted a pre-eminent location. If the town was an important episcopal seat, sometimes the main square was dominated by a cathedral; however, cathedrals were often sited a short distance away at the point where the old grid and the newer medieval urban fab-<lb/>
ric commingled. In such a location there would develop a cathedral square, and inevitably certain regional and temporary market functions would coalesce around and within it.</p>
<p>Additional market squares developed, some close to the center, some adjacent to parish churches, and others near the town's principal gates. The last came about because, once inside the walls, those granted the privilege of doing business in the town created a public trading area in the most immediately convenient location. Because the towns were, in effect, market organisms built for the production and trade of goods&#x2014;with home, workshop, and salesroom combined within the same structure&#x2014;there was considerable competition for space throughout. Streets could be narrow, and houses often encroached upon their boundaries or pushed upper stories into the space above them. The medieval street might thus acquire a highly irregular &#x2014;and to later eyes picturesque&#x2014;character.</p>
<p>In such notable instances as <name type="place">Florence</name> and <name type="place">Siena</name>, civic pride&#x2014;the luxury of late medieval prosper-<lb/>
ity&#x2014;began to assert itself. An urban aesthetics that was specific to individual cities became apparent. In <name type="place">Florence</name>, where there already existed the example of a Roman orthogonal grid with its <hi rend="italic">cardo, decumanus</hi>, and central forum, citizens sought beautiful, wide, straight streets. Streets received more sunlight after the imposition of building codes governing balconies and other projections. In <name type="place">Siena</name>, hilly topography con-<lb/>
spired with the elegant curvilinear Gothicism that remained a local ideal in art as well as town planning, with the result that building lines were made to con-<lb/>
form to the gentle arcs of its principal thoroughfares and shell-shaped central Campo (fig. 3.22).</p>
<p>With prosperity, medieval towns became increasingly dense; however, there was still within their walls a good deal of green open space. Behind dwellings, yards contained animals, fruit trees, and kitchen gardens. In the wedge-shaped areas between the radial streets there was room, particularly near the periphery of the town, to site new abbeys and monas-<lb/>
teries. As surging enterprise drew an illiterate and impoverished peasantry from the surrounding coun-<lb/>
tryside, mendicant orders, such as those of the Fran-<lb/>
ciscans and Dominicans, arose in response to the increasingly turbulent, uneasy, and afflicted life of medieval cities. These orders were dedicated to main-<lb/>
taining the social order, suppressing heresy, and min-<lb/>
istering to the population through preaching and caring for the sick and the indigent. They formed hospices and hospitals on remaining open lands in the less trafficked zones between the major thorough-<lb/>
fares and near the peripheries of cities. Here another medieval innovation, the urban university, found sim-<lb/>
ilar accommodation. Although these institutions had long been considered the province of the Church, in the cities, where wealth was independent of ecclesi-<lb/>
astical patronage, they soon acquired independent status. The public bath reappeared, becoming a late medieval center of relaxation and social intercourse.</p>
<p>The market forces governing the growth of cities in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were often dynamic enough to stimulate development outside the walls as well as within. Suburban settlements known as <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi> sprang up in the zones immediately out-<lb/>
side certain principal gates even before the towns became crowded inside.<ref target="#CH3-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref> Because the taxes imposed
<pb n="121"/>
<pb n="121" type="orig"/>
upon those doing business within the town walls could be avoided here, lively market squares formed within them. As the growing cities within the walls exerted pressure to expand, and as this need combined with their desire to annex the profitable <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi>, a new band of walls was built enclosing the area occupied by one or, often, several <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi>. This situation, from the point of view of the <hi rend="italic">faubourg</hi> residents, was also desirable since, offsetting the burden of taxation, true citizenship brought with it various legal privileges, economic advantages, and greater physical security. With the cre-<lb/>
ation of the new walls, the old inner circle of walls was usually, though not always, removed, and a new cycle of <hi rend="italic">faubourg</hi> creation began near the gates along the redrawn town periphery.</p>
<p>Although enjoying a large degree of communal autonomy, medieval cities and towns were still embed-<lb/>
ded within the larger power structure in which the king and other great secular magnates held sway, retaining their holdings through military prowess. Living off revenues generated by the city as well as the countryside, feudal lords had interests that were funda-<lb/>
mentally inimical to those of the townspeople. Never-<lb/>
theless, they, along with the king, served as military protectors, a role that was effectively expressed in the defensive architecture of the castle and its protective siting on a hillside above the town. Alternatively, princes and bishops built residences in strategic loca-<lb/>
tions at vulnerable positions within the fortified walls. Though situated within cities, these aristocratic com-<lb/>
pounds were not part of urban life, acting as barriers to public circulation and obstacles to the towns' natural development.</p>
<p>Most of the maps and views of medieval cities are not medieval; they are, as a rule, engravings of the six-<lb/>
teenth and seventeenth centuries. But, because street patterns are typically resistant to alteration and urban structural turnover in pre-industrial times was slow, these nevertheless serve as fairly accurate plans and per-<lb/>
spectives of medieval towns (see fig. 3.20). Today the historic gates or portals depicted in these engravings survive only as monuments and place-names, commem-<lb/>
orating former walls. Although a few walled medieval cities still exist, their walls are tourist attractions and no longer function as barriers to entry. In cities that have continued to experience periods of growth, such as <name type="place">Paris</name>, <name type="place">Vienna</name>, and <name type="place">Florence</name>, former walls can be traced as boulevards and ring roads.</p>
<p>Beyond security and taxation&#x2014;the primary func-<lb/>
tional reasons for urban enclosure&#x2014;there were sym-<lb/>
bolical and psychological reasons for the inward focus of medieval cities and the institutions and structures within them. The cathedral itself was a sanctuary enclosing a sacred mystery. In this regard, it was not unlike the nature sanctuaries of antiquity; its cool, dim interior was analogous to that of a cave or grotto. Out-<lb/>
side many churches, behind the apse, there was often a space called "paradise" where flowers to decorate altars, statues, and shrines were grown. Within cloister gardens, in addition to the four paths emanating from a central fountain or well like the biblical rivers of the Garden of <name type="place">Eden</name>, fruit trees and other plants symbolized the renewal of life in the green groves of heaven. Thus, like the <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">chahar bagh</hi></name>, which was a physical and sym-<lb/>
bolical manifestation of the Islamic paradise described in the Quran, the quadripartite cloister garden was emblematic of the equally idyllic (if less sybaritic) par-<lb/>
adise found in the Hebrew and Christian Bible.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Walled Gardens</hi></hi></head>
<p>In the medieval garden the best productions of wild nature were concentrated and enhanced through hus-<lb/>
bandry and horticulture. Game, fish, fruit, grapes for winemaking, and flowers were found there. The medi-<lb/>
eval garden was also meant to be a <hi rend="italic">locus amoenus</hi>, an earthly paradise, a sanctified spot from which the wicked (or uninitiated) were excluded, the province of such deserving souls as princes, poets, and lovers as well as monks and gardeners (fig. 3.23).</p>
<p>In horticulture, as in so many other areas, Euro-<lb/>
pean knowledge declined after the eclipse of Roman civilization. We have seen how Arabic scholarship at <name type="pname">C&#x00F3;rdoba</name> kept alive ancient agricultural practices inher-<lb/>

Drawing after a 9th-century manuscript illustration. Near the lower right-hand corner is a vegetable garden with eighteen rectangular beds carefully labeled with the names of various types of produce. Next to this garden lay the cemetery, which was also the orchard. The herb garden in the upper right-hand corner of the plan is located logically next to the infirmary. Until the rise of medical schools in the late Middle Ages, when a new professional class tried to outlaw the practice of monastic medicine, monks acted as physicians not only within their own communities but also to patients from outside the monastery. The medicines that they and the trained doctors who were their successors used were herbal ones, and the pharmacopoeia they derived from plants was extensive.</figDesc>

<p>Presented, like <name type="pname">Columella</name>'s first-century treatise, as a series of books on the practical aspects of farming and estate management (including site selection and overall layout of domicile, farm buildings, orchards, and gardens), its value to us is twofold: first, as a description of medieval gardening practices and design and, second&#x2014;because of the numerous illustrated manuscript and published editions&#x2014;as a visual source of the ideal, if not the actual, appearance of many medieval gardens. It is primarily a "how-to" manual, detailing the proper ways of tilling the soil, sowing and reaping crops, growing fruit and shade trees, tending vines, making wine, and managing livestock, fish, and game. While <name type="pname">Piero</name> gives prescriptions, rather than descriptions, of actual gardens, it is fair to assume that the gated walls, square planting beds, vine-clad arbors and trellises, flowery turf benches, fountains and well-<lb/>
tended fruit trees that we see in illustrations of the <hi rend="italic">Liber ruralium commodorum</hi> reflect the appearance of actual medieval gardens in his day and later. What is most apparent in studying these manuscript paintings and early book prints is the absence of spatial compo-<lb/>
sition. The principle of subordinating the garden's parts to an overall plan in which spatial considerations are paramount does not seem to govern their layout.
<pb n="123"/>
<pb n="123" type="orig"/>
These are gardens of objects&#x2014;plants, walks, and structures&#x2014;the arrangement of which is primarily for utility and the pleasure they afford in and of them-<lb/>
selves.</p>
<p>Indeed, most medieval gardens were utilitarian arrangements designed to provide cooking and medicinal herbs, fruit, and vegetables. Although con-<lb/>
siderably earlier than the period we are examining here, the ninth-century Plan of <name type="pname">St. Gall</name> showing the ideal layout of a monastery was probably a valid pro-<lb/>
totype for similar Late Medieval communities (fig. 3.25). The <name type="pname">St. Gall</name> scheme is probably more orderly than the gardens in real monasteries, where vegeta-<lb/>
bles were often grown in the random spaces around the various workshops and in individually tilled plots behind the monks' cells.</p>
<p>Most of the great rural monasteries have van-<lb/>
ished, but there are still to be found within certain urban monasteries and convents, like carefully guarded jewels, old cloister gardens with the sancti-<lb/>
fied atmosphere of medieval times. Notable among these are three in <name type="place">Rome</name>: that of the <name type="place">Basilica of SS. Quattro Coronati</name> (Four Crowned Saints) (fig. 3.26), that of <name type="pname">St. John</name> in the Lateran, and that of <name type="pname">St. Paul</name>'s Outside the Walls. The colonnettes framing the clois-<lb/>
ter garden are often twisted or braided and inlaid with glittering bits of mosaic in the decorative style known as Cosmatesque.</p>
<p>Between these and two other Roman cloister gardens&#x2014;that of <name type="pname">S. Giovanni Battista dei Genovesi</name> and that of the <name type="pname">Palazzetto Venezia</name>&#x2014;a profound sty-<lb/>
listic change is evident. Although the cloister's basic form and intended symbolism remain unaltered, one senses in these the influence of the theories of <name type="pname">Leone Battista Alberti</name> (<date when="1404">1404</date>&#x2013;<date when="1472">1472</date>), the great humanist scholar, poet, mathematician, and architect, who pro-<lb/>
moted the development of an architectural style along principles derived from classical antiquity. In these early Renaissance examples, the decoratively con-<lb/>
ceived, comparatively insubstantial colonnettes of the earlier cloister gardens have given way to solid, unadorned columns with simple foliated capitals derived from ancient Roman architecture.</p>

<p>Even devout men like painter Fra Angelico found inspiration in the forms of pagan antiquity, as is evident in his contemporary panel of <hi rend="italic">The Annunci-<lb/>
ation</hi> (c. <date when="1440">1440</date>&#x2013;<date when="1450">50</date>) (fig. 3.27). Like other painters of his day, Fra Angelico was influenced by the theory and practice of <name type="pname">Alberti</name> as he began to define three-di-<lb/>
mensional spaces for his figures to inhabit. <name type="pname">Mary</name> is depicted in an enclosed convent garden, a symbol of her virginity and a paradisiacal space, or "third" nature, elevated in meaning above the cultivated fields of "second" nature and the fearful connotations of wilderness, or "first" nature. However, the archi-<lb/>
tecture of the loggia where the heavenly visitation occurs is similar in style to that which we will exam-<lb/>
ine in the next chapter in our discussion of the Renais-<lb/>
sance villa and its interweaving of landscape and architectural space. To understand better the import-<lb/>
ant changes that were occurring in the relationship between human beings and the landscape and the ways in which the concept of three natures was elab-<lb/>
orated by allegory at this time, it will be necessary to look more closely at the cultural and intellectual movement called humanism.</p>

<p>The wall surrounding the Renaissance garden eventually became, metaphorically, a shell to be cracked open. The confi-<lb/>
dence in human reason, which is a lasting legacy of the Renais-<lb/>
sance, profoundly changed humanity's view of nature. Throughout the period examined in this chapter, the garden remained visibly contained within walls. But the emphasis upon axial planning was a first step toward spatial thrust and the apparent extension of its boundaries to the horizon. Although the process of transformation into an outward-focused concept of landscape design was a slow one&#x2014;it began to be obvious only in the seventeenth century&#x2014;it had its origins in the cul-<lb/>
tural rebirth known as the Renaissance and the Neoplatonic separation of the real and the ideal, the world of humans and the world of God.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Dante Alighieri</name> (<date when="1265">1265</date>&#x2013;<date when="1321">1321</date>) prefigured a more expansive human view of landscape in <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy</hi>, in which the narrator begins his pilgrimage in a dark wood, guided&#x2014;signifi-<lb/>
cantly&#x2014;by the ancient Roman poet <name type="pname">Virgil</name> through a metaphys-<lb/>
ical landscape, which ultimately offers, after an ascent of Mount Purgatory, the exhilaration of panoramic perspective. <name type="pname">Petrarch</name>, figuratively following in <name type="pname">Dante</name>'s footsteps, attempted what was then unheard of, the actual ascent of Mont Ventoux, a hardship endured because, as he wrote to a friend, "My only motive was to see what so great an elevation had to offer." Here we have, quite literally, a new and much bolder human perspective of the terrestrial landscape than that of medieval individual who, with gaze turned inward, contemplated only the visionary landscape of paradise. <name type="pname">Petrarch</name>'s view from Mont Ventoux prefigures a shift in attitude toward landscape as a response to a new confi-<lb/>
dence in human powers of reason. The resulting liberation of science and the fostering of a spirit of open-ended inquiry found an expressive analogue in the design of actual contemporary landscapes as the inwardly focused, self-contained paradise gar-<lb/>
den gradually gave way to an expansive, outwardly directed, more worldly garden.</p>
<p>More specifically, we can see in the evolution of Renais-<lb/>
sance garden design a reflection of changing cosmological belief.<ref target="#CH4-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> The humanist philosopher and mathematician <name type="pname">Nicolaus</name> of <name type="pname">Cusa</name> (<date when="1401">1401</date>&#x2013;<date when="1464">1464</date>) posited the concept of spatial neutrality&#x2014;that is, the notion that space is unbounded and the universe has no center&#x2014;a century before <name type="pname">Nicolaus Copernicus</name> (<date when="1473">1473</date>&#x2013;<date when="1543">1543</date>) developed his theory of planetary movement around the sun and two centuries before <name type="pname">Galileo</name> (<date when="1564">1564</date>&#x2013;<date when="1642">1642</date>) improved the tele-<lb/>
scope for astronomical use. In the West, the trend toward land-<lb/>
scape designs that portray seemingly unbounded garden space, tentative and partial at first but fully assured by the seventeenth century, mirrors the progress of cosmological thought from <name type="pname">Cusa</name> to <name type="pname">Ren&#x00E9; Descartes</name> (<date when="1596">1596</date>&#x2013;<date when="1650">1650</date>) as the old Aristotelian spatial paradigm was gradually abandoned and the foundations of modern physics were laid.</p>
<p>In addition to opening the door to modern science, Renais-<lb/>
sance humanism revived the classical forms and practices of antiquity. The publication in 1499 of the immensely influential <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</hi>, believed to be the work of the archaeologically minded <name type="pname">Francesco Colonna</name>, provided numer-<lb/>
ous illustrations depicting arbors, pavilions, colonnades, foun-<lb/>
tains, grottoes, <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, topiary, and other elements of a reinvented classical language specifically directed toward land-<lb/>
scape design (fig. 4.1). <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>, the influential treatise on architecture by <name type="pname">Leon Battista Alberti</name> (<date when="1404">1404</date>&#x2013;<date when="1472">1472</date>), published in 1452, provided a ready reference for a new generation of architects.

<p>Using ancient practice as a guide in codifying their own building principles, Renaissance princes revived the use of axial symmetry, and they put their own stylistic stamp on many decorative motifs borrowed from ancient classical structures. In the powerful proportions of old Roman forms as well as in the rich vocabulary of antique classical ornament they found a means to ennoble humanity and to glorify certain men&#x2014;the princes of the Church as well as the secular rulers of the day. Like the ancient Romans, they built villas in the country as retreats from business life, places to cultivate the intellect and sometimes&#x2014;espe-<lb/>
cially in Tuscany and the Veneto, but also in <name type="place">Rome</name>&#x2014;the land.</p>
<p>Wealthy connoisseurs collected antiquities. Classical sculpt-<lb/>
ure, which had lain buried in the ground, was avidly unearthed, and several Renaissance villa gardens were designed as showcases for these works of art. But as there were insufficient ancient works to furnish all the gardens that were being built, Renaissance artists emulated the norms of antiquity in new sculpture and decoration.</p>
<p>The resurrection of ancient sculpture and the revival of antique forms re-established interest in classical deities, making profane sub-<lb/>
jects as important as sacred ones and as useful for artistic purposes. Gods and goddesses took up residence in the human imagination once again. Embraced by popes and cardinals, who interpreted "pagan" mythology as prefiguring Christian religion, the ancient divinities provided garden designers with a reinvented antique imag-<lb/>
ery and classical design vocabulary that superseded the Christian paradise imagery of the Middle Ages. Often these mythological fig-<lb/>
ures were symbolically allied with Christian ideals, as in the case of <name type="pname">Hercules</name>, a figure of virtuous strength and chastity. In landscape design, classical sculpture was arranged in groupings, or tableaux, to convey allegorical messages that flattered the patrons who commis-<lb/>
sioned them, and these were often linked as a series of iconographic statements within a planned garden itinerary.</p>
<p>Astronomy and astrology remained firmly intertwined, and Renaissance intellectuals were as fascinated with mystical symbols as their medieval forebears had been. Within the humanists' conceptual framework, classical myth came to take its place alongside Christian mystery. The arcane symbolism within the <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poli-<lb/>
phili</hi> proved enormously appealing to Renaissance patrons and artists. Sculpture and water were used as elements in increasingly elaborate iconographic programs that celebrated the fruitful partnership human-<lb/>
ity had achieved with nature through art and technology. Indeed, the message-laden garden programs Renaissance humanists developed for their noble patrons can be considered the theme parks of their day. Although the garden still functioned as a metaphor of paradise, it now became something more: a theater for the initiated, those with sufficient human-<lb/>
ist education to enable them to decode allegorical statements as they followed a garden itinerary in which fountains and sculptures told often complex sto-<lb/>
ries that alluded to the patron as the author of a new Golden Age, a facili-<lb/>
tator of a terrestrial paradise benefiting all humankind.</p>
<p>As in other branches of art, so too in landscape design the lofty serenity and stable balance of mature Renaissance composition soon gave way to the more complicated and dynamic spatial organization characteristic of the late Renais-<lb/>
sance of the mid-sixteenth century. Iconography grew ever more allusive and personal. A similar stylistic development as is seen in painting, sculpture, and architecture can be found in the history of landscape design, as we trace its course from quattrocento human-<lb/>
ism through a brief period of classical equipoise in the early years of the sixteenth century into the opulent age of the late Renaissance.</p>
<p>As the Renaissance emerged in <name type="place">Italy</name>, the Reformation and the establishment of various Protestant denominations occurred in Northern <name type="place">Europe</name>. <name type="place">Rome</name>, as the seat of Catholicism, launched the Counter-Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century and, in the con-<lb/>
text of that movement, attempted to inspire faith through artistic means. Thus, in the late sixteenth century, <name type="place">Italy</name> embarked upon a course of design that led to the robust plasticity and florid ornamen-<lb/>
tation of the Baroque style characterizing Italian art and architecture throughout the seventeenth century. Meanwhile, throughout the sixteenth century, Renaissance Italian artistic forms were absorbed in <name type="place">France</name>. There an indigenous Renaissance style developed, which evolved into the grandeur of the French seven-<lb/>
teenth-century version of the Baroque, a more austere form of neo-<lb/>
classicism than the highly theatrical Italian Baroque style. The manifestations of these respective developments in the evolution of Renaissance style in <name type="place">Italy</name> and <name type="place">France</name> will be examined in Chapter Five. Our task here is to trace the rise of Italian humanism and its contribution to the development of a Renaissance style that in <name type="place">Italy</name> reached a climactic stage at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was brilliantly manipulated in a Mannerist mode and adopted by the French, who transformed it into an artistic idiom of their own, even as Renaissance thought was exerting an influence upon the land-<lb/>
scapes of <name type="place">Germany</name>, the Low Countries, and <name type="place">England</name>. Although the process of cultural transmission to other lands was well established by the sixteenth century, we will reserve that discussion for Chapter Six. Because the Renaissance was initiated and carried forward by a small elite of royal and noble patrons influenced by ideas fostered by scholars and expressed by artists, our discussion is necessarily focused upon power centers, the courts of monarchs and princes, the villas and <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi> they commissioned, and the cities they sought to beautify.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Petrarch</name> (<name type="pname">Francesco Petrarca</name>, <date when="1304">1304</date>&#x2013;<date when="1374">1374</date>) fathered the intellectual movement known as humanism. Human-<lb/>
ism to <name type="pname">Petrarch</name> meant the rediscovery of the writings of classical antiquity and the objective, inquiring atti-<lb/>
tude toward the natural world that informed those texts. He believed that Greek and Roman thought were the cornerstones upon which a new future would be built. He further believed in a new morality in which human will, though subservient to divine law, could exercise a greater degree of autonomy than it had during the Middle Ages, when an expansive curiosity was viewed as an affront to theological doctrine. The recovery and study of the classical past, coupled with the intellectual and moral energy released by the new spirit of scientific inquiry and respect for individual achievement, constituted in the minds of the historical protagonists an intellectual rebirth, which they called in Italian <hi rend="italic">rin&#x00E0;scita</hi>, a term that became translated in French and English as <hi rend="italic">renaissance</hi> in the nineteenth century when it gained currency among those examin-<lb/>
ing the art of the sixteenth century. Everything that lay between the fall of <name type="place">Rome</name> and the dawn of the exciting new age was to them an intermediate time, or Middle Age. Thus, these humanists bestowed the name by which we still know the interval of history between the sixth and the mid-fourteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Kept alive by priests and monks, Latin continued to serve as the international tongue of educated Europe-<lb/>
ans throughout this period. Now, however, the human-<lb/>
ists wanted more than the continuation of medieval Latin as the language of the educated class. They actu-<lb/>
ally wanted to write not in the Latin they had inherited from medieval scholastics but in the language and syn-<lb/>
tax of the Roman orator and statesman <name type="pname">Marcus Tullius Cicero</name> (106&#x2013;43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) and the Roman poet <name type="pname">Virgil</name> (70&#x2013;19 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>). Moreover, humanist scholars wanted not only to write in the tones and style of these eminent ancients, but they also wanted to think about the world in the same ways as they had, examining morality from the perspective of <name type="pname">Plato</name> (c. 427&#x2013;c. 347 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) or inves-<lb/>
tigating the natural world in the manner of <name type="pname">Pliny</name> the Elder (23&#x2013;79 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>). Ironically, success in reviving ancient Latin as a literary language had the effect of promoting vernacular tongues at the expense of medie-<lb/>
val Latin, which fell into gradual disuse.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Petrarch</name> and his followers drew no distinctions between the life of the mind and the life of the city; to serve his countrymen, the contemplative man was morally bound to also be a man of action. The human-<lb/>
ism of <name type="pname">Petrarch</name> was disseminated by men of letters who saw themselves as statesmen along the lines of <name type="pname">Cicero</name>, men whose political programs were informed by intellectual discourse and promulgated with rheto-<lb/>
ric. <name type="pname">Cosimo de' Medici</name> (<date when="1389">1389</date>&#x2013;<date when="1464">1464</date>) captured political control of <name type="place">Florence</name> in 1434, ruling as an enlightened humanist. In 1439, he brought the General Council of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches to his city, hospitably subsidizing the gathered prelates who included among them <name type="pname">Gemistos Plethon</name> (c. <date when="1355">1355</date>&#x2013;<date when="1450">1450</date>/<date when="1455">55</date>), the most respected authority on <name type="pname">Plato</name>. The presence in the streets of so many distinguished guests provided the people of the city with a new sense of cosmopolitanism. Some of these ecclesiastics came from <name type="pname">Constantinople</name>, then the wealthiest and most sophisticated city in the world. Founded by <name type="pname">Constan-<lb/>
tine</name> as the new <name type="place">Rome</name> in 330 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, <name type="pname">Constantinople</name> was both the principal seat of Christianity in the <name type="place">Byzantine Empire</name> and the main repository of classical culture after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> Some Greek Orthodox monasteries had managed to preserve, along with Early Christian manuscripts, cop-<lb/>
ies of certain ancient classical texts. Because the <name type="place">Byz-<lb/>
antine Empire</name> endured until the <name type="pname">Ottoman Turks</name> overthrew <name type="pname">Constantinople</name> in 1453, the Greek Ortho-<lb/>
dox Church still served in <name type="pname">Cosimo</name>'s day as a link in a long chain of scholarship reaching back through van-<lb/>
ished Roman libraries to the ancient Greeks. Humanist scholar <name type="pname">Marsilio Ficino</name> (<date when="1433">1433</date>&#x2013;<date when="1499">1499</date>) thought that <name type="place">Florence</name> could perhaps replace this lost center for ancient Greek scholarship and perpetuate the intellec-<lb/>
tual conversations begun in his city following the 1439 gathering there of so many learned Greek scholars. <name type="pname">Ficino</name> is believed to have founded the Platonic Acad-<lb/>
emy under the auspices of <name type="pname">Cosimo</name> around 1462 at the <name type="pname">Medici</name> patriarch's Villa <name type="place">Careggi</name> near <name type="place">Florence</name>. To this place <name type="pname">Cosimo</name> came "not to cultivate the fields, but my soul."<ref target="#CH4-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The creation of this society of humanists, which lasted until 1494, signaled a moment of confident ide-<lb/>
alism in Western history. The tenets of humanism became the province of a small but influential group of intellectuals, including officers of the Church. These prelates were increasingly disposed toward its philos-<lb/>
ophy as well as its theories of beauty, which they nour-<lb/>
ished with their literary and artistic patronage. The garden assumed special status as a place of contempla-<lb/>
tion and learning, as well as an architectural space and opportunity for fresh artistic expression.</p>
<pb n="128"/>
<pb n="128" type="orig"/>
<p><name type="pname">Ficino</name>'s Neo-Platonism drew on the works of <name type="pname">Plotinus</name>, the third century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> <name type="pname">Alexandrian</name> philoso-<lb/>
pher who posited a Godhead from which all creation emanates and with which the soul can be mystically united, as well as on the writings of <name type="pname">Augustine</name> and the twelfth-century Neoplatonists. His philosophy gave special status to the soul as the agent of the transcen-<lb/>
dent, cognitive, creative intellect standing at the mid-<lb/>
point between the earthly and the divine, mediating between the higher and lower worlds. For <name type="pname">Ficino</name>, mys-<lb/>
tical love as inspired by <name type="pname">Plato</name>'s theory of love in the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi>&#x2014;"divine madness"&#x2014;is the source of poetic genius. Its goal is beauty, which is divisible into two oppositional realms: celestial and natural, as personified by the two Venuses often por-<lb/>
trayed in Renaissance art&#x2014;one symbolizing sacred love, the other profane. <name type="pname">Ficino</name>'s philosophy gave new status to the artist, whose task it was to translate pure form&#x2014;ideal beauty&#x2014;into physical reality, a project assisted by mathematical concepts of proportion and harmony.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Ficino</name>'s disciple, <name type="pname">Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</name> (<date when="1463">1463</date>&#x2013;<date when="1494">1494</date>), articulated the then-radical concept of individual free will, which granted the artist enormous creative potential and mimetic power to juxtapose and combine forms in new representations of nature with meanings derived not from doctrinal religion but from the human intellect. Increasingly, the natural sciences informed this enterprise. As the tenets of a static medi-<lb/>
eval scholasticism based on the concept of a closed, rather than an open, universe, were gradually over-<lb/>
turned by this invigorating license to a more open-<lb/>
ended mode of inquiry, the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi> became the <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi>, or secret garden, a secluded and enclosed garden room, a place of intimate contact with nature within the larger Renaissance garden. As if in self-conscious recognition of the philosophical nature of this transaction, a principal theme often expressed in the iconography of the Renaissance garden is the syncretism of Art and Nature. Moreover, the <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi> anticipated the botanical garden in which exotic and native plants were collected and displayed in a systematic fashion.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Petrarch</name>, a devout Christian, sought spiritual truth in nature as well as practical knowledge. Toward these ends, he created two gardens near his home at Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, collected rare plants, and con-<lb/>
ducted experiments in growing several plant varieties under varying geographic, seasonal, meteorological, and astrological conditions. One garden, situated on a slope, he referred to as his "transalpine Parnassus." The other, closer to his house and situated on an island in the middle of a fast-flowing river, was accessible "by a little bridge leading from a vaulted grotto where the sun never penetrates." Prefiguring by four hundred years the form and function of <name type="pname">Alexander Pope</name>'s famous grotto at <name type="place">Twickenham</name>, which we will examine in Chapter Seven, <name type="pname">Petrarch</name> said that he believed his grotto "resembles that small room where <name type="pname">Cicero</name> some-<lb/>
times went to recite; it is an invitation to study, to which I go at noon."</p>
<p>The several villas built by <name type="pname">Cosimo</name> and his <name type="pname">Medici</name> successors a century after <name type="pname">Petrarch</name> proved to be pru-<lb/>
dent investments in the rural economy and refuges in times of plague or political strife. They were also cen-<lb/>
ters for intellectual recreation and conversation. For a time, in the buoyant atmosphere of the Renaissance, the Italian villa became once more, as it had been in antiquity for <name type="pname">Pliny</name> the Younger, a philosophical and literary retreat where the aristocracy celebrated the pleasures of rustic life.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Lorenzo</name> the Magnificent (<date when="1449">1449</date>&#x2013;<date when="1492">1492</date>), the grandson of <name type="pname">Cosimo</name>, did not enjoy the same degree of wealth and power as <name type="pname">Cosimo</name> had, conspicuous though he was as a benefactor of <name type="place">Florence</name>. Occupying his time less fully with the banking activities of his family, <name type="pname">Lorenzo</name> threw himself even more energetically into statecraft and the pursuit of the arts. He liked to gather artists, musicians, and members of the Platonic Academy around him at his villas at <name type="place">Fiesole</name>, <name type="place">Cafaggiolo</name>, <name type="place">Careggi</name>, and <name type="place">Poggio a Caiano</name>. Although <name type="pname">Leon Battista Alberti</name> died soon after <name type="pname">Lorenzo</name> came to power, he was influential within this humanist circle, and his treatise on architecture,_<hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>, was a constant reference work for <name type="pname">Lorenzo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Alberti</name> was a versatile polymath, among other things a poet, a scholar of classical literature and phi-<lb/>
losophy, and an author of treatises on perspective and other aspects of painting as well as on sculpture and on villa design specifically. Although he later designed buildings, he avoided direct involvement in the con-<lb/>
struction process, setting himself apart from architects of humbler origins who usually served as both design-<lb/>
ers and supervisors of construction. <name type="pname">Alberti</name> advised <name type="pname">Pope Nicholas V</name> on various urban projects. His theo-<lb/>
ries on architecture merged under one definition of beauty: "that reasoned harmony of all the parts within a body, so that nothing may be added or taken away, or altered, but for the worse," a state he called <hi rend="italic">cocin-<lb/>
nitas</hi>. He saw in geometry nature's order, advocating symmetry and the arrangement of various building parts according to symbolically sig-<lb/>
nificant ratios of proportion, thus translating Neopla-<lb/>
tonic ideals of natural harmonic form into architectural reality.<ref target="#CH4-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><name type="pname">Alberti</name> derived several of his architectural con-<lb/>
cepts from the principles of order and harmony found in nature and saw nature in its own right as a source of
<pb n="129"/>
<pb n="129" type="orig"/>
pleasure. According to <name type="pname">Alberti</name>, villas should be sited on gentle elevations with a view of the surrounding countryside. Gardens should have porticoes that would afford both sun and shade and also serve as an archi-<lb/>
tectonic link in making garden space continuous with that of the house. For large gatherings he prescribed a festive open space and for quiet pleasure the presence of springs of water. He advised planting boxwood hedges in sheltered locations and was not averse to arranging these in the form of the owner's monogram after the fashion of the ancient Romans. Nor did he disapprove of comic statues in the garden, "provided they are not obscene."<ref target="#CH4-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at <name type="place">Fiesole</name></hi></hi></head>
<p>Sometime prior to 1455, <name type="pname">Cosimo</name> commissioned <name type="pname">Mich-<lb/>
elozzo di Bartolommeo</name> (<date when="1396">1396</date>&#x2013;<date when="1472">1472</date>) to design the <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at <name type="place">Fiesole</name> for his son Giovanni (figs. 4.2, 4.3). Built between 1458 and 1461, the villa's primary function was not as a working farm, but as a setting for intellectual life and a demonstration of aesthetic and ideological values. As architectural historian <name type="pname">James S. Ackerman</name> points out, "<name type="pname">Michelozzo</name>'s simple arcaded cube was the first modern villa designed without thought or possibility of material gain."<ref target="#CH4-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref> Judging from a contemporary fresco painted by <name type="pname">Domenico del Ghir-<lb/>
landaio</name> (<date when="1449">1449</date>&#x2013;<date when="1494">1494</date>), it was covered in off-white stucco. Although devoid of Albertian classical details, it followed the prescription for siting set forth in <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>. Conspicuous from afar, it rose from a terraced embankment in conscious imitation of <name type="pname">Pliny</name>'s siting of his first-century-<hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> villas at Laurentinum and Tusci, where scenic perspective was an important consideration. The <name type="pname">Medici</name> villa at <name type="place">Fiesole</name> with its com-<lb/>
manding view of nearby <name type="place">Florence</name> was the first since ancient times to consciously exploit the potential of its site in this way and was thus a prototype for the Plinian view that would become a significant element in the location, orientation, and design of future Italian gar-<lb/>
dens, which for this and other reasons were situated on hillsides whenever possible.</p>

<p>The east front of the villa was an entirely open loggia before one of the bays was walled in. On the west front the loggia remains entirely open, and one can fully appreciate its spatial fusion with a lovely <hi rend="italic">giar-dino segreto</hi>, or secret garden. This is an early example of the way Italian designers, who conceived of villa and garden as integral architectural compo-<lb/>
nents, created indoor and outdoor spaces that interpen-<lb/>
etrated one another. Originally <hi rend="italic">giardini segreti</hi> were
<pb n="130"/>
<pb n="130" type="orig"/>
small enclosed garden rooms, but here, where the scenic potential of the site was exploited, garden and loggia overlook a panoramic view of the Arno Val-<lb/>

<p>A gate leads from this garden to a terrace run-<lb/>
ning along the south side of the house. Beyond this terrace, a long pergola overlooks the lower terrace garden with its clipped, cone-shaped magnolia trees (<hi rend="italic">Magnolia grandiflora</hi>) surrounded by lawn and hedges of box. Restored and planted in its current form at the beginning of the twentieth century by <name type="pname">Cecil Pinsent</name> for <name type="pname">Lady Sybil Cutting</name>, as noted in Chapter Ten, this garden and the grassy terrace above are decorated with lemon trees in terra-cotta pots. The grade change between the pergola and the lower terrace garden is not exploited as an opportu-<lb/>
nity for ornamental stairs, as similar slopes were to be in later Italian gardens. The lower garden is, how-<lb/>
ever, cut into the hillside and is sufficiently lower than the upper garden so as not to intrude upon the panoramic view from the upper terrace.</p>
<p>Even though the <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at <name type="place">Fiesole</name> was built simply as a country retreat rather than as work-<lb/>
ing villa, agricultural scenery abruptly abuts it. This unselfconscious shift from garden formality to olive trees and fields, which had also characterized the ancient villa landscape as described by <name type="pname">Pliny</name>, can be seen in many other Tuscan gardens. Much as mod-<lb/>
ern urbanites enjoy the apple orchards and potato fields around their country houses without them-<lb/>
selves engaging in agricultural pursuits, <name type="pname">Lorenzo</name>'s circle delighted in the bucolic landscape of <name type="place">Fiesole</name>. There the scholar-poet <name type="pname">Angelo Poliziano</name> (<date when="1454">1454</date>&#x2013;<date when="1494">1494</date>) wrote his "Rusticus," a celebration of the pas-<lb/>
toral poetry of such ancient writers as <name type="pname">Horace</name>, <name type="pname">Hesiod</name>, <name type="pname">Columella</name>, and <name type="pname">Virgil</name>. The poem is also a paean to the view of <name type="place">Florence</name> with the silvery Arno in the distance and to <name type="pname">Lorenzo</name>'s patronage and gen-<lb/>
erosity of spirit. In this way, rural values and urban power were harmoniously aligned within the cul-<lb/>
tural matrix of humanism.</p>
<p>The humanist attitude toward nature implicit in the siting of the <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at <name type="place">Fiesole</name> is also reflected in <name type="pname">Florentine</name> quattrocento painting. The artist's receptivity to natural beauty could not have occurred had not late medieval philosophy as well as the new humanism caused a profound shift in society's overall cultural perspective. Christian faith was not abandoned, but individual excellence and human achievement were increasingly valued. Sci-<lb/>
entific observation and humanistic aesthetics fos-<lb/>
tered an interest in nature and delight in the beauties of landscape. Classical mythology was incorporated into the education of the well-to-do, and allegory using classical themes and images was extensively employed in art and literature.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Sandro Botticelli</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Primavera</hi>, a painting of about 1482, expresses both the naturalistic and arcane aspects of Renaissance humanism (fig. 4.4). Paintings such as this, as well as gardens of the period, were intended as both literal and metaphori-<lb/>
cal paradises. At the same time, they were presented as visual texts to be decoded, as bearers of messages to be deciphered, as stationary dramas for the dis-<lb/>
cerning. While the key to its meaning has been much debated by scholars, it is clear that in the <hi rend="italic">Primavera</hi> we have not only an image comparable to the medi-<lb/>
<pb n="131"/>
<pb n="131" type="orig"/>
eval paintings of the <name type="pname">Virgin Mary</name> in a flowery mead, but, more important, a Renaissance interpretation of the paradise or <name type="pname">Venus</name> gardens of ancient literature. The garden over which <name type="pname">Botticelli</name>'s <name type="pname">Venus</name> presides is clearly the garden of love. On the right we see Zephyr, the harbinger of Spring and ravisher of Chloris. The latter, as compensation for having been thus taken, is turned into the adjacent Flora. In the orange trees that form a bower for <name type="pname">Venus</name>, <name type="pname">Cupid</name> points his arrow toward one of the three Graces. Completing the scene is Mercury, a god associated with the month of May. The painting is thought by some authorities to com-<lb/>
memorate the wedding, in <date when="1482-05">May 1482</date>, of a member of the <name type="pname">Medici</name> family.</p>
<p>It is apparent from this and other quattrocento paintings that allegory, for more than a thousand years pressed into the service of the Christian faith, has returned to its classical origins and that classical sub-<lb/>
jects are no longer prohibited by religious authorities intent upon stamping out "pagan" belief. Christian and classical themes now served in a syncretic man-<lb/>
ner as primary subjects for artists for the next three hundred years. Gardens were populated almost entirely by classical deities and mythological heroes, as Christian humanists read new meanings into ancient myths. One explanation for this lies in the extraordinary influence exerted by the <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotoma-<lb/>
chia Poliphili</hi> on garden design.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</hi></hi></hi></head>
<p>In 1499, the Venetian publisher <name type="pname">Aldus Manutius</name> brought forth an enigmatic and fascinating book with descriptions and woodcut illustrations that were to have a great influence upon garden design. Called <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</hi>, it is reputedly the work of a Dominican monk and nobleman, <name type="pname">Francesco Col-<lb/>
onna</name> (<date when="1433">1433</date>&#x2013;<date when="1527">1527</date>). At Palestrina, <name type="pname">Colonna</name> was engaged with his father, <name type="pname">Stefano</name>, in restoring the Tem-<lb/>
ple of Fortuna Primigenia, a Greco-Roman goddess associated with Egyptian veneration of the Nile (see fig. 2.24). <name type="pname">Colonna</name> shared the interest of Pico and other Neoplatonists in mystery religions and their ini-<lb/>
tiatory rituals. These involved the decoding of caba-<lb/>

<p>Translated by <name type="pname">Jean Martin</name>_in 1546, the <hi rend="italic">Hypnero-<lb/>
tomachia Poliphili</hi>_was published in <name type="place">France</name> as <hi rend="italic">Dis-<lb/>
cours du songe de Poliphile</hi> with a new set of woodcut illustrations in the mannerist style associated with the School of Fontainebleau. When the English edition appeared in 1592, its title was rendered as "The Strife of Love in a Dream."<ref target="#CH4-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref> The protagonist, <name type="pname">Poliphilus</name>, whose name means "Lover of Polia," is the narrator of a many-layered erotic dream in which his passion for architecture and gardens of great intricacy and decorative sumptuousness is fully indulged along with his extravagant devotion to his beloved. <name type="pname">Poliph-<lb/>
ilus</name> journeys to the gardens of <name type="pname">Queen Eleuterilyda</name> and, in the company of Polia, to the island of <name type="place">Cytherea</name>, where he describes the "groves, meadows, gardens, streams and springs" in elaborate detail. In the middle of the island is "<name type="pname">Venus</name>'s fountain with seven precious columns,"<ref target="#CH4-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> the scene of the climax of Book One in which the naked Goddess of Love is described in delectable detail and <name type="pname">Poliphilus</name> is pierced by Cupid's arrow. Here and in the other imaginary locales visited by <name type="pname">Poliphilus</name>, <name type="pname">Colonna</name> displays his intense interest in ornamental architecture and ingenious devices.</p>
<p>The woodcut illustrations from <name type="pname">Colonna</name>'s book, with their fanciful topiary and knot garden designs and images of grove, grotto, classical pergola, vine-<lb/>
clad arcade, and pseudo-Egyptian esoteric devices, including an elephant with an obelisk mounted in its back, became a source of inspiration for several gen-<lb/>
erations of garden designers. The book was also an important means of disseminating Renaissance gar-<lb/>
den style, especially in the second half of the sixteenth century following the publication of the immensely popular French edition (fig. 4.5).</p>

<p>Influenced by the nature of <name type="pname">Colonna</name>'s book, although not by its specific text, in which a clear nar-<lb/>
rative line is difficult to follow, gardens became firmly associated with allegory as places of allusion and meaning. Their paths became prescribed routes through a series of theatrical stops where sculptural or architectural embellishments, often in association with water, posed intellectual riddles and provided answers of a symbolic nature. In attempting to understand their meaning in the Renaissance, it is important to recall not only the intellectual excitement generated by a renewed appreciation of classical mythology but also the interest among certain educated people in the arcanely symbolic imagery derived from Egyptian forms, Neoplatonism, and alchemy.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Poliphilus</name>, like <name type="pname">Dante</name>'s protagonist in <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy</hi>, begins his journey in a dense grove of trees. This dark wood symbolizes the lack of certainty that confronts any pilgrim setting out upon a quest. The grove, which in antiquity was associated with sacred places as well as with <name type="pname">Plato</name>'s Academy and <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>'s Lyceum, was revived in the Renaissance in the form of the <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi>, a planting usually of evergreen ilex trees.<ref target="#CH4-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> The <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> is the realm of nature and the repre-<lb/>
sentation of the Golden Age extolled by the ancient writers <name type="pname">Ovid</name> and <name type="pname">Virgil</name>, an earthly paradise evoking the time when people lived in a hospitable environ-<lb/>
ment surrounded by nature's bounty of berries and nourishing acorns. Its natural forms and deep shade produced an air of wildness and mystery, serving as a foil to the otherwise geometrical garden. Pleasant ref-<lb/>
uges from the hot summer sun, <hi rend="italic">boschi</hi> were integral to the iconographic programs of certain garden land-<lb/>
scapes. They provided appropriate settings in which the visitor could encounter, with a degree of surprise, the symbolical features that had been strategically placed along a prescribed path.</p>
<p>The grotto, like the sacred grove, had ancient associations with mysterious life forces. The well-<lb/>
spring of streams, it was the home of river gods and nymphs. Grottoes such as the one described by <name type="pname">Col-<lb/>
onna</name> became practically obligatory elements in six-<lb/>
teenth-century gardens, and their popularity continued far into the nineteenth century, when they served as Romantic features in many parks and gardens. In the period we are examining here, there were two kinds: those with artificial stalactites and encrustations of colored stones and shells and those of a more architec-<lb/>
tural character, nymphaeums with niched arcades for statuary.</p>
<p>The importance of the <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poli-<lb/>
phili</hi> as a mirror of the Renaissance imagination stems from its fusion of the highly artificial and the natural into a "third nature"<ref target="#CH4-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> embodying complex and inter-<lb/>
woven sets of symbols that often convey polysemous mythic narratives, allegorical stories with several intended meanings. With its combination of eroticism and idealism, it profoundly expanded the garden's conceptual horizons, making it possible to read into its design multiple texts and individual expressions of imagination.</p>
<p>A new sense of the garden's expressive possibil-<lb/>
ities and a new vocabulary of garden design forms were now at hand. Albertian <hi rend="italic">cocinnitas</hi>, or economi-<lb/>
cally perfect harmony of parts, as manifested in the integration of the elements of the garden plan along clearly defined axes with compositional symmetry of parts, was now fused with <name type="pname">Colonna</name>'s notion of the gar-<lb/>
den as an allegorical environment in which one could follow an itinerary of initiation and revelation.<ref target="#CH4-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> Math-<lb/>
ematics and mythology, geometry and allegory, were now firmly joined. To exploit this expressive potential in a grammar of landscape art&#x2014;a design style&#x2014;would take genius. Fortunately, genius was at hand in the person of the architect <name type="pname">Bramante</name>.</p>

<p>Encouraged by his reading of <name type="pname">Pliny</name> the Younger, <name type="pname">Petrarch</name>'s first somewhat tentative embrace of pan-<lb/>
oramic perspective on Mont Ventoux heralded the scenic appreciation that would later become a hall-<lb/>
mark of Renaissance thought. The Italian word <hi rend="italic">bel-<lb/>
vedere</hi>, meaning "beautiful view," is an important one in the history of landscape design because of its association with a particular type of garden structure. Built in various styles, depending upon time and place, a belvedere may be either an independent tower or part of the villa itself. A belvedere is, quite simply, a lookout whose purpose is the enjoyment of scenery. During the Renaissance, belvederes became an important means of enjoying the view of gardens and the surrounding landscape. The papal villa known as Belvedere, built by <name type="pname">Innocent VIII</name> (papacy <date when="1484">1484</date>&#x2013;<date when="1492">1492</date>) on a hill within the <name type="place">Vatican</name> is important for our discussion here, however, not only because of its original siting with commanding views of the Roman countryside but also because the subsequent treatment of the ground that lay between it and the <name type="place">Vatican</name> influenced the course of garden history.</p>
<p>Bisected in the late sixteenth century by a struc-<lb/>
tural addition to the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Palace, half of the Court of the Belvedere today serves as a parking lot for <name type="place">Vat-<lb/>
ican</name> employees, while the remaining half is a pleasant sculpture garden where visitors can stroll (figs. 4.8, 4.9). Few today therefore, comprehend its significance as a pivotal development in the history of landscape design. Perhaps because so much later Italian, and indeed European, landscape design was derived from <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s axial terraced composition here, this once-revolutionary garden seems only inevitable, not radical, to us.</p>
<p>The seed for a garden on this spot was sown in the quattrocento. The first humanist pope, <name type="pname">Nicholas V</name> (papacy <date when="1447">1447</date>&#x2013;<date when="1455">1455</date>) was deeply interested in architecture, and he employed <name type="pname">Alberti</name> as his consul-<lb/>
tant on such projects as the reconstruction of Old <name type="pname">St. Peter</name>'s and the integration of this basilica with the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Palace. The plan that <name type="pname">Alberti</name> conceived included a palace garden. Though considerably smaller in scale, in its ambitious program this garden harked back to <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa rather than to any immediate predecessor, for it was not conceived as a series of outdoor rooms where intimate conversation could take place, as were some of the new villa gar-<lb/>
dens near <name type="place">Florence</name>, but rather as a space for public gathering and theatrical entertainment. This plan was abandoned at <name type="pname">Nicholas</name>'s death in 1455, and not until a half century later was a garden program for the <name type="place">Vatican</name> begun in earnest.</p>
<p>Immediately upon his election to the papacy, <name type="pname">Pope Julius II</name> (papacy <date when="1503">1503</date>&#x2013;<date when="1513">1513</date>) began imple-<lb/>
menting a plan for a <name type="place">Vatican</name> garden that was part of a political agenda to increase the importance of the papacy as a power in <name type="place">Europe</name>, with the <name type="place">Vatican</name> serv-<lb/>
ing as the seat of a new Roman empire. The revival of the ancient Roman villa tradition within the walls of the <name type="place">Vatican</name> thus served as a symbolical link to imperial times. To perform this work, the pope chose as his architect <name type="pname">Donato Bramante</name> (<date when="1444">1444</date>&#x2013;<date when="1514">1514</date>), who had recently completed the sophisticated <hi rend="italic">tempietto</hi> adjacent to <name type="pname">San Pietro</name> in <name type="place">Montorio</name> on the <name type="place">Janiculum Hill</name>, and whom he would soon commission to design a new basilica for <name type="pname">St. Peter</name>'s. <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s first com-<lb/>
mission from the pope was to provide a physical link between the Belvedere of <name type="pname">Innocent VIII</name> on its hill and the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Palace below, creating sheltered commu-<lb/>
nication between the two buildings. At the same time, he was to provide a setting for the pontiff's fine col-<lb/>
lection of antique sculpture and an outdoor theater to serve as a suitable space for papal pageantry. In addi-<lb/>
tion, <name type="pname">Julius II</name> wanted to have a private garden retreat, a place where he could meet and converse with a circle of friends who shared his interest in the redis-<lb/>
covery of the classical world.</p>
<p>In developing his design, <name type="pname">Bramante</name> employed <name type="pname">Alberti</name>'s principles of symmetry and proportion in an axial organization of forms and space that had not been seen since antiquity. He even set about resolving a problem that was generally left unresolved in ancient Roman landscape planning, the harmoniza-<lb/>
tion of two colliding axes.</p>
<p>On the uneven terrain between the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Pal-<lb/>
ace and the Belvedere, <name type="pname">Bramante</name> placed two parallel loggias, which were three stories on the lowest level adjacent to the palace, then two stories as the rising slope was transformed into an intermediate terrace, and finally one story where an upper terrace joined the villa (fig. 4.9). The steps necessitated by these grade changes in the terraced hillside became import-<lb/>
ant design elements in their own right, their double staircases celebrations of ascent. Perpendicular to the broad terraces between the loggias (today's museum galleries) was a strong central axis terminating next to the villa in a raised niche&#x2014;or exedra, so called because of its semicircular form. From the windows
<pb n="134"/>
<pb n="134" type="orig"/>
of the papal apartments the garden appeared as a stage set or painting demonstrating the principles of sin-<lb/>
gle-point perspective, one of the technical discoveries of the Renaissance that theater designers and artists often virtuosically demonstrated in their work. Follow-<lb/>
ing <name type="pname">Bramante</name>, designers planned gardens with elevated terraces or balconies overlooking them in order that the viewer could readily grasp from this vantage point the axes that enabled and made manifest a perspectival treatment of space.</p>

<p>The elevated niche and its flanking wings screened the awkward juncture of two axes, that of the Belvedere Court and that of the villa. <name type="pname">Bramante</name> is believed to have modeled this architectural composition along the lines of the terraced Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Pal-<lb/>
estrina (see fig. 2.24). Around 1550, under <name type="pname">Pope Julius III</name> (papacy <date when="1550">1550</date>&#x2013;<date when="1555">1555</date>), <name type="pname">Michelangelo Buonarroti</name> (<date when="1475">1475</date>&#x2013;<date when="1564">1564</date>) replaced <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s semicircular Prae-<lb/>
neste-like steps with the double flight of stairs we see today. Paired staircases by then had become ubiquitous in Italian garden design as a means of reinforcing axial symmetry and dramatizing the transition from terrace to terrace. Hillsides were therefore the most desirable sites for garden designers after <name type="pname">Bramante</name> showed at the Bel-<lb/>
vedere Court how designers could successfully exploit steep terrain.</p>
<p>The construction of the Belvedere Court did not occur all at once, but proceeded sporadically over half a century. In addition to replacing <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s unusual convex-concave stairs in front of the exedra, <name type="pname">Michelan-<lb/>
gelo</name> enclosed the arcade that formed its curving rear and raised the northern wall next to it an additional story. In 1561, <name type="pname">Pius IV</name> (papacy <date when="1559">1559</date>&#x2013;<date when="1565">1565</date>) summoned the architect <name type="pname">Pirro Ligorio</name> (c. <date when="1510">1510</date>&#x2013;<date when="1583">1583</date>) to finish the proj-<lb/>
ect. <name type="pname">Ligorio</name> vaulted the niche to create the Nicchione, or Great Niche, and built its surmounting semicircular log-<lb/>
gia (figs. 4.7, 4.9). At the opposite end of the Court, he
<pb n="135"/>
<pb n="135" type="orig"/>
added a semicircle of tiered stone seats resembling those of a Roman theater to facilitate viewing the tour-<lb/>
naments and other spectacles that took place there (fig. 4.9).</p>
<p>In 1516, <name type="pname">Cardinal Giulio de' Medici</name>, later <name type="pname">Pope Clement VII</name>, commissioned <name type="pname">Raphael</name> (<name type="pname">Raffaello San-<lb/>
zio</name>, <date when="1483">1483</date>&#x2013;<date when="1520">1520</date>) to design the Villa Madama on Monte Mario. <name type="pname">Raphael</name>'s friend and collaborator <name type="pname">Giulio Romano</name> (<date when="1492">1492</date>/<date when="1499">9</date>&#x2013;<date when="1546">1546</date>) helped with the realization of the design, and <name type="pname">Antonio da Sangallo</name>, the Younger (<date when="1485">1485</date>&#x2013;<date when="1546">1546</date>), was probably also involved in the proj-<lb/>
ect. It was the first villa to be constructed on the out-<lb/>
skirts of <name type="place">Rome</name>. Like the Farnesina, the <date when="1508">1508</date>&#x2013;<date when="1511">1511</date> villa designed by <name type="pname">Baldassare Peruzzi</name> (<date when="1481">1481</date>&#x2013;<date when="1536">1536</date>) on the banks of the Tiber, it was intended for supper par-<lb/>
ties attended by popes and cardinals as well as by phil-<lb/>
osophical noblemen and witty courtesans. These entertainments were an important feature of Roman life during the papacy of <name type="pname">Julius II</name> and his successor, <name type="pname">Leo X</name> (papacy <date when="1513">1513</date>&#x2013;<date when="1521">1521</date>). Like the Farnesina, the Villa Madama has a beautifully frescoed loggia that serves as the nexus of interpenetrating indoor and out-<lb/>
door spaces.</p>
<p>Designed in a halcyon era when humanist gath-<lb/>
erings and summer entertainments were still the order of the day, the structures of the villa were subservient to the gardens, which stretched out along lengthy axes. From the entrance on the south, one passes into an entry court and beyond through an entry loggia into the large central court. This axis is projected through another loggia in which recessed niches seem to pull the outdoor space into the architecture of the building, while simultaneously pushing the fabric of the build-<lb/>
ing into the adjacent garden. <name type="pname">Giovanni da Udine</name> (<date when="1487">1487</date>&#x2013;<date when="1561">1561</date>/4), whose beautiful frescoes of garlands embellish the ceiling of the Farnesina, also worked at the Villa Madama, painting the frescoes that decorate the bays of this loggia in the antique style of those found in <name type="pname">Nero</name>'s Golden House (fig. 4.10). Originally the loggia, which is now glassed in, opened directly onto the garden. Lofty loggias with the adjacent gar-<lb/>
den in axial relation to them, the successors of the <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at <name type="place">Fiesole</name>, help to dissolve the visual separa-<lb/>
tion between building and nature and are among the hallmarks of Italian villa design.</p>
<p>Curiously, the axial orientation of the Villa Mad-<lb/>
ama, unlike that of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, does not exploit the scenic potential of its lofty site on Monte Mario but runs laterally across the hillside instead of along its gradient. <name type="pname">Raphael</name> planned another perpendic-<lb/>
ular axis that would have accomplished this purpose, but his design for this extension of the garden was never executed. The garden's principal view therefore remains that from the loggia along the villa's main axis as it continues outdoors through a garden of boxwood compartments and a long terrace stretching across the flank of Monte Mario to the north. These two spaces are separated by a tall vine-clad wall pierced with a pedimented gate guarded by a pair of colossal male figures. Parallel to this garden at a lower level is a rectangular fish pond (fig. 4.11). Fish ponds were com-<lb/>
mon in medieval gardens, but the architectural charac-<lb/>
ter of this one introduces us in a preliminary and rudimentary way to what would become one of the chief means of Italian Renaissance garden expression: the use of water as an important design element. Water was employed with great imagination in subsequent sixteenth-century Italian gardens, appearing in foun-<lb/>
tains, pools, water staircases, water <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">giocchi d'acqua</hi>, or droll water games that involved the spectator physically by providing surprise drench-<lb/>
ings from concealed jets suddenly activated. Water in these gardens was a means of providing mesmerizing reflectivity, movement, and excitement. It was meant to connote evanescence, insubstantiality, and tempo-<lb/>
rality, while implying the agrarian bounty achieved when humans harness this vital force of nature.</p>

<p>The <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name>, built for <name type="pname">Pope Julius III</name> shortly after his ascent to the papacy in 1550, is a Renaissance masterpiece. <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name> himself participated in its plan as did the architects <name type="pname">Giorgio Vasari</name> (<date when="1511">1511</date>&#x2013;<date when="1574">1574</date>), <name type="pname">Bartolommeo Ammannati</name> (<date when="1511">1511</date>&#x2013;<date when="1592">1592</date>), and <name type="pname">Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola</name> (<date when="1507">1507</date>&#x2013;<date when="1573">1573</date>). Though stripped of much of its original rich sculptural d&#x00E9;cor, the villa is nonetheless a remarkable sight, demonstrating a sophis-<lb/>
ticated interlocking of interior and exterior space and axial gamesmanship (fig. 4.12). Located in a valley to the west of <name type="place">Rome</name> just outside its walls, it was originally designed as a papal retreat and later served as a stopover and staging area for formal processions by foreign digni-<lb/>
taries approaching the <name type="place">Vatican</name>. As at the Villa Madama, the house was simply an accessory to the garden and intended not as a residence but as a place for papal enter-<lb/>
tainment.</p>
<p>One enters the vestibule and passes immediately into a beautiful semicircular portico embracing a horse-<lb/>
shoe-shaped court. While the wall frescoes imitate the ancient Roman painting that antiquarians were discover-<lb/>
ing at the time, the ceiling frescoes of this curving portico are painted as <hi rend="italic">trompe-l'oeil</hi> flower- and vine-covered trellises (fig. 4.13). These perhaps echo the real arbor that sheltered papal dignitaries and other distinguished guests as they walked to and from the Tiber through the once-ex-<lb/>
tensive gardens. A massive, highly polished, blood-pur-<lb/>
ple porphyry fountain basin, recovered from the Baths of Titus, formerly stood in the center of the garden court, catching the water that fell from the mouth of a swan beside a figure of <name type="pname">Venus</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Beyond the garden court lies the <hi rend="italic">pi&#x00E8;ce de r&#x00E9;sis-<lb/>

From the back of the loggia a pair of curving staircases sweeps down to <name type="pname">Vignola</name>'s cool subterranean grotto. <hi rend="italic">Topia</hi>, landscape paintings reminiscent of the sacro-idyllic landscapes that decorated ancient Roman villa walls were placed along the sides of the court in front of the <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi>, a grotto inhabited by sculptural representations of nymphs, here serving as caryatids. The <hi rend="italic">topia</hi> are now gone, and gone, too, is the romantic mystery of the moss-padded grotto as it appeared to the American author <name type="pname">Edith Wharton</name>, who wrote about Italian villas and their gardens at the beginning of the twentieth century when they were

declining into antique picturesqueness. Using a mod-<lb/>

phaeum</hi>, returning them to their original whiteness.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name>'s spatial treatment compels the movement of the eye along a more tortuous route than does a High Renaissance garden with its clearer axial organization and more static spatial composition. Sur-<lb/>
prise&#x2014;the unfolding of elements not seen or antici-<lb/>
pated in advance&#x2014;has become a device within the garden designer's means, one that assumes kinetic experience, movement through space, as an underly-<lb/>
ing principle. Here the garden has become an itiner-<lb/>
ary, a route that teases as it pulls one along a path. Along the central axis stretching between the entry vestibule and the garden behind the <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi>, space is subtly organized into a series of unexpected events. One passes from the narrow vestibule into the embrace of the horseshoe-shaped court and is drawn irresistibly toward the loggia at the rear. Because the bays on each side of the central portal of this loggia have been opened up, this axial tug is partially relaxed, but one is nevertheless propelled forward.</p>
<p>Inside the open loggia one is surprised to find the precipitous drop to the lower level court. The cur-<lb/>
vilinear staircases wrapping around the sides of this semicircular court echo the curving embrace of the entry court portico. But here is a visual puzzle, for while one can see through a rear loggia behind the <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi> into a garden, the strong axis has become entirely imaginary at this point, and there is no imme-<lb/>
diately visible route leading from the first loggia to the second and out into that garden. To proceed, one must descend one of the curving staircases to the lower court where yet another puzzle presents itself, for here one sees the subterranean grotto with its cary-<lb/>
atids supporting the terrace of the loggia above but finds no visible access to it. Like <name type="pname">Poliphilus</name> in <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia</hi> or Alice in Wonderland, one must, as in a dream, search for the door that opens to the delightful underground grotto where the buxom cary-<lb/>
atids stand on their water-girt platform. <name type="pname">Ammannati</name> placed this secret entrance in the midlevel grotto located beneath the first loggia between the two curv-<lb/>
ing staircases. A pair of staircases leading up to the rear garden hides within a second midlevel grotto beneath the rear loggia.</p>

<p>In <name type="pname">G. B. Falda</name>'s engraving of the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Gardens we see the Villa Pia, also called the Casino Pio, built by <name type="pname">Pirro Ligorio</name> for <name type="pname">Pope Pius IV</name> in 1560. Like the <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name> it has a spatially ambiguous plan that visually pulls one in and through while making physical pas-<lb/>
sage at first appear occluded. At the same time, it provides an example of another important Renais-<lb/>
sance Italian contribution to the tradition of garden design: the <hi rend="italic">casino</hi>, or summerhouse, built as a retreat from the bustle and ceremony of court life. Here the pope held soir&#x00E9;es at which invited scholars sat around an oval court discussing philosophy, poetry, and reli-<lb/>
gion. Discussion groups had become an important part of the intellectual life of Renaissance men of letters, and <name type="pname">Ligorio</name>'s oval, which is embraced by exe-<lb/>
dras of carved stone seats, is an architectural expres-<lb/>
sion of the humanists' pleasure in scholarly conversation (fig. 4.16).</p>
<p>The recovery of the art and architecture of antiq-<lb/>
uity provided villa designers with immediate sources of inspiration. As an archaeologist, <name type="pname">Ligorio</name> himself had thoroughly explored <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa on behalf of the Este family, and the mosaics that embellish the loggia of the Villa Pia and the arched portals entering the court reveal a renewed appreciation of ancient Roman decorative art. Low reliefs in stucco found on ancient Roman baths, palaces, and villas were echoed at the Villa Pia and elsewhere.<ref target="#CH4-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Along with the wall frescoes and mosaics uncovered by sixteenth-century archaeologists, ancient marble sculptures were being excavated from the Roman soil. Several great collections were formed at this time, and to accommodate them the garden began to assume the role of outdoor museum. In addi-<lb/>
tion to the Belvedere Court at the <name type="place">Vatican</name>, <name type="pname">Bramante</name> built a <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi>, the so-called Statue Court, located between the upper court and the Belvedere, for <name type="pname">Pope Julius II</name>'s collection of antique sculpture. In 1584, <name type="pname">Cardinal Fernando de' Medici</name> bought the col-<lb/>
lection amassed some sixty years earlier by <name type="pname">Cardinal Andrea della Valle</name>, sending the freestanding pieces to <name type="place">Florence</name> to embellish the Boboli Gardens and keep-<lb/>
ing the reliefs to decorate the facade of his villa on the Pincian Hill in <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>
<p>Inspired by the discoveries of classical archae-<lb/>
ology, patrons commissioned new sculpture. The notion became firmly established that the garden was a setting in which white marble figures should be seen against dark green foliage or framed by architectural niches within building facades and garden walls. The humanists' interest in classical mythology furnished artists with thematic material, which they wove into narrative itineraries. Familiar literary themes that found expression in the garden included those of the Golden Age, Elysium, rustic goodness, <name type="pname">Venus</name> presid-<lb/>
ing over the Garden of Love, Apollo, the Muses, Mount Parnassus, and the virtuous hero assigned near-impossible tasks or waylaid by treacherous enchantments.</p>
<p>An important element of Renaissance garden iconography was nature itself. One sees, for instance, in the <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> above the Belvedere Court and the Villa Pia in the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Gardens, the desire for a wildwood, an evocation of the sacred grove in antiquity. Simi-<lb/>
larly, it is reported that <name type="pname">Pope Julius III</name>, with his taste for simple country food, peasant dances, and wine festivals, enjoyed strolling in the untamed parts of his <hi rend="italic">vigna</hi> (literally vineyard, the term contemporaries used for a suburban villa retreat). These were abun-<lb/>
dant with wildlife, melodious with birdsong, and adorned with works of art. Like their ancient prede-<lb/>
cessors, Renaissance villa owners wanted their groves to be haunted by the sculptural representatives of river gods, nymphs, satyrs, Pan, Diana, and <name type="pname">Venus</name>.</p>
<p>Added to this literary agenda was another, more obvious, motive for the development of Renaissance garden iconography: the aggrandizement of the gar-<lb/>
den owners' reputations through symbols, with the implication that the patrons' power was being put to beneficent use for humankind. Increasingly, after the middle of the sixteenth century, Italian gardens became manifestations of princely power. This was true in <name type="place">Florence</name> as well as in <name type="place">Rome</name>, although such Tuscan gardens as the <name type="pname">Medici</name> villa at <name type="pname">Castello</name> remained much more conservative in design than did the dazzling villa creations of the popes and cardinals in and around <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>

<p>Although <name type="pname">Castello</name> and the Boboli Gardens contained water features symbolically associated with <name type="pname">Duke Cosi-<lb/>
mo</name>'s reputation as a builder of aqueducts, it is to the Roman Campagna that we must turn to find gardens that apotheosize water and use it with the inventiveness of a choreographer directing the movements of the dance or the creativity of a sculptor exploring the plasticity of clay. These effects were accomplished through the inge-<lb/>
nuity of sixteenth-century <hi rend="italic">fontanieri</hi>, virtuosic hydraulic engineers with an understanding of metaphysics as well as physics and a reputation akin to that of magicians because of the ingenuity of their creations.<ref target="#CH4-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref> In the gar-<lb/>
dens of Villa d'Este water reaches a height of expres-<lb/>
siveness that is analogous not only with dance and sculpture, but with music as well. For it is the drip and gurgle, the murmur and roar, the splash and tinkle, as well as the cooling spray, of water everywhere that has made this garden unforgettable to visitors through the centuries.</p>
<p>Like other superb gardens, Villa d'Este is the prod-<lb/>
uct of a passionate obsession on the part of an owner willing to spend extraordinary sums of money and with the taste to hire the best design talent available. In 1550, the cardinal of Ferrara, Ippolito D'Este (<date when="1509">1509</date>&#x2013;<date when="1572">1572</date>), was appointed governor of Tivoli by <name type="pname">Pope Julius III</name>. Tivoli, an ancient Roman summer resort about twenty miles west of <name type="place">Rome</name>, was not only the site of <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa, but of many other second century <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> patrician villas. Its desirability then as later was due to the waters of the Aniene River, which came cascading dramatically down steep precipices; to its salubrious mineral springs; and to the excellent drinking water that was channeled from several sources along the riverbank to four major aqueducts serving the Roman metropolis. An aqueduct carrying water from the Rivellese Spring, the cost of which was borne by both the cardinal and the town of Tivoli, which also benefited, was built in 1561 after work on the garden had begun in earnest.</p>
<p>The governor's palace, a perquisite of the cardinal's appointment, was part of an old Franciscan monastery beside the Church of <name type="pname">Santa Maria</name> Maggiore at the top of a hill adjacent to the western town wall. <name type="pname">Pirro Ligorio</name> was commissioned to oversee the renovation of the palace into a summer residence suitable for <name type="pname">Cardinal Ippolito</name>, the son of <name type="pname">Duke Alfonso I</name> of Ferrara and Lucrezia Bor-<lb/>
gia. But the palace was to be a relatively minor element of the entire project; as the cardinal had already demon-<lb/>
strated at a villa he had rented on the Quirinal in <name type="place">Rome</name>, gardens were his passion. In <name type="pname">Ligorio</name> he had not only a capable designer but also the foremost archaeologist of his day, the person who was responsible for several exca-<lb/>
vations including that of nearby <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa and for the rediscovery of many antique marbles, mosaics, and other artifacts. Being a wealthy humanist collector, <name type="pname">Ippolito</name> had, in fact, put <name type="pname">Ligorio</name> on his payroll as his personal archaeologist in 1550, the year in which he had been appointed to the Tivoli post and had begun to dream of a great hillside garden below the palace. One part of <name type="pname">Ligorio</name>'s job was undoubtedly to garner antique marbles to combine with contemporary sculpture in allegorical compositions throughout the garden.</p>
<p>Although <name type="pname">Ligorio</name> was himself a sufficiently accomplished classicist to develop the various icono-<lb/>
graphic themes that would portray the humanistic ideals of the cardinal, he was probably assisted by the cardi-<lb/>
nal's resident poet, <name type="pname">Marc-Antoine Muret</name> (<date when="1526">1526</date>&#x2013;<date when="1585">1585</date>).<ref target="#CH4-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref> After 1560, <name type="pname">Giovanni Alberti Galvani</name> served as superintending architect in charge of overseeing the con-<lb/>
struction of masonry stairs, fountains, fish ponds, and other features. Professional <hi rend="italic">fontanieri</hi> were hired to develop the water devices that operated the spectacular fountains.</p>
<p>The construction of the gardens of the Villa d'Este continued over a twenty-two-year period until the cardi-<lb/>
nal's death in 1572, when work stopped abruptly. Con-<lb/>
temporary visitors, including the French essayist Montaigne (<date when="1533">1533</date>&#x2013;<date when="1592">1592</date>), lamented their unfinished state, although in the seventeenth century, when inheritance problems engendered by <name type="pname">Cardinal Ippolito</name>'s will were finally resolved, <name type="pname">Cardinal Alessandro</name> d'Este undertook some restoration and improvements. While vegetative growth, alterations, and periodic lack of maintenance have blurred some of the formality seen in a contempo-<lb/>
rary engraving, we can still discern <name type="pname">Ligorio</name>'s design and, with the help of modern scholarship, decode the human-<lb/>
ist themes that are woven into its fabric: Nature's abun-<lb/>
dance and generosity and the relationship between Art and Nature&#x2014;one of the central preoccupations of the Renaissance (figs. 4.17&#x2013;4.20). In parsing the humanist meaning of the garden, which besides expressing the Art-Nature duality has many references to the virtuous mythological hero <name type="pname">Hercules</name>, here identified with <name type="pname">Cardi-<lb/>
nal d'Este</name>, one should remember that the original public entry to the garden was not from the villa, but rather from a gate in the outer wall set in the hillside below.</p>
<p>Standing on the balcony of the villa today, the vis-<lb/>
itor looks beyond the verdant mature tree canopy of the gardens to the distant hills. Below is the <name type="pname">Cardinal's Walk</name> and the rainbow spray of Bernini's seventeenth-century Fountain of the Great Beaker, which mingles visually with the watery plume of the Fountain of the Dragons beneath it. The dragons symbolize the ones guarding the Garden of the Hesperides, which were slain by <name type="pname">Hercules</name>. Descending one of the diagonal ramps, one comes to the Alley of the Hundred Fountains composed of three con-<lb/>
duits symbolizing the three tributaries of the Tiber, which flow from the hills of Tivoli toward <name type="place">Rome</name>. Here

<q>The traditional plan of most Italian Renais-<lb/>
sance gardens&#x2014;a plan in which there are compartmentalized beds near the villa and, as one approaches the outer limits of the property, a surrounding screen of trees&#x2014;has been reversed here because of the nature of the site. A wooded slope with diagonal paths to accommodate the steep grade lies directly beneath the retaining wall supporting the villa terrace. Where the valley has been remodeled by an extensive process of cutting and filling to create an apron of level terrain and a geometrically pitched northeast side slope, cross-axes divide the garden into square compart-<lb/>
ments.</q>
<q>The relationship between Art and Nature constitutes the principal theme of the garden's iconography. Nature is dramat-<lb/>
ically manifested in the Fountain of Nature, also known as the Water Organ, culminating the water axis on the northeast (fig. 4.18). Following a "concert," which occurred when water pressure was manipulated to trap and release air in its pipes, a <hi rend="italic">fontaniere</hi> would flush the vaulted chambers behind the elaborate facade, and a deluge would spill down the steep slope. This effect was made permanent in the twentieth-century Fountain of the Cascade, an enormous waterfall pouring into the pond below. An earlier cascade was created here by the seventeenth-century architect, sculptor, and fountain designer, <name type="pname">Gianlorenzo Bernini</name> (<date when="1598">1598</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680">1680</date>); it fell in successive stages like a natural waterfall rather than as the dra-<lb/>
matic sheer spill we see today.</q>
<q>The human ability to employ the resources of nature toward fruitful ends constitutes Art, which is celebrated along the second major cross-axis, the Alley of the Hundred Fountains (fig. 4.20). The Alley itself is composed of three conduits sym-<lb/>
bolizing the three tributaries of the Tiber&#x2014;the Albuneo, the Aniene, and the Erculaneo&#x2014;which flow toward <name type="place">Rome</name>. The art of channeling their waters into aque-<lb/>
ducts was an important factor in the life of the recently reborn metropolis. Along the upper rim, water is channeled between carved obelisks, boats, eagles, and <hi rend="italic">fleurs de lys</hi> (the last two forms being emblematic of the Este family).</q>
<q>At the northeast end of the Alley of the Hundred Fountains, within an enclosed piazza, stands the principal fountain of the garden, the Fountain of Tivoli, or as it is now known, the Oval Fountain (fig. 4.19). A colossal statue of Albunea, the Tiburtine Sibyl, presides over the cascade, which is furnished by water from the River Aniene, which flows into an oval basin surmounted by a ball; its spurting jets delineate the Este <hi rend="italic">fleur de lys</hi>. The sources of the Aniene and the Erculaneo are represented as reclining river gods set in naturalistic grottoes built into the surrounding slope. Crowning this artificial rock work is a statue of Pegasus, the magical horse whose hoofprints sup-<lb/>
posedly struck water out of Mount Parnas-<lb/>
sos, thereby creating the fountain of the Muses and proclaiming the power of Art.</q>

water is channeled between carved obelisks, boats, eagles, and <hi rend="italic">fleur de lys</hi> (the last two forms being emblematic of the Este family) and pours from one basin into another through grotesque animal heads.</p>
<p>After visiting the Fountain of Tivoli and the Fountain of the Rometta, a water feature that was fashioned of stucco-covered brick to represent ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> in miniature, one returns to descend one aim of the sweeping oval staircase and gaze back up at the villa through the spray of the Dragon Foun-<lb/>
tain. Taking the central staircase, which has channels of clear water running down its flanking walls, one arrives at the next level, that of the fish ponds. Here, looking back toward the villa, one realizes that <name type="pname">Ligo-<lb/>
rio</name> has repeated <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s design for the Belvedere Court as a series of descending terraces organized around a central axis. But there is an important differ-<lb/>
ence: <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s Renaissance garden could be grasped in its entirety from a single vantage point within the <name type="place">Vatican</name> Palace, but the Villa d'Este cannot be taken in altogether. Not only is it more spatially intricate than the <name type="pname">Bramante</name> prototype, but it is also a programmatic garden, one in which the separate parts are meant to be experienced sequentially as part of a humanist itinerary that celebrates the importance of <name type="pname">Cardinal d'Este</name> and the noble family of which he was the most conspicuous representative. Today, it is shorn of much of the sculptural decoration because the cardinal's fine collection of antique statuary was sold in the eighteenth century. While this loss deprives the villa of iconographic specificity and the-<lb/>
matic continuity, the garden tour that was once enjoyed by the cardinal's guests and subsequent trav-<lb/>
elers nevertheless remains a memorable experience for modern visitors.</p>
<p>Contemporary with the Villa d'Este is <name type="pname">Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Gambara</name>'s garden at Bagnaia, three miles east of the town of Viterbo. It is known today by the name of its seventeenth-century owners, the Lante family. Like the Villa d'Este, it offers a virtuosic expression of Bramantian axial planning combined with a highly imaginative use of water. Also like the Villa d'Este, the Villa Lante is filled with an allusive iconography wedding humanist learning to personal glory and family pride. It bears further similarity in being a garden that is meant not to be taken in all at once, but rather as sequential stops along a prescribed route that move the visitor off the central axis. Here, however, the garden itiner-<lb/>
ary has a prologue as one is meant to pass first through the kind of "dark wood" traversed by certain literary figures as they started out on their journeys of initiation, a device with great appeal to the humanist imagination.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name> was given the bishopric of Viterbo in 1566, and two years later received confir-<lb/>
mation of one of the perquisites of his office, property rights in the old hunting park at Bagnaia. His prede-<lb/>
cessors had enclosed the park, which consisted of the wooded slope of <name type="pname">Monte Sant' Angelo</name>, and had built the aqueduct that brought water to the town as well as to the park. A small hunting lodge was the only structure on the property when the cardinal conceived the notion of building a great villa garden there. In place of the <hi rend="italic">barco</hi>, or park for hunting, there would be a twenty-acre <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> with the kinds of messages of allusion that a humanist scholar steeped in the litera-<lb/>
ture of antiquity would have sought. Continuing this iconographic narrative, there would be a formal gar-<lb/>
den in which Art gained the upper hand over Nature, in celebration of the cardinal's magnificence and benefactions to the people of Viterbo.</p>
<p>The designer of Villa Lante is almost univer-<lb/>
sally believed to have been the architect <name type="pname">Giacomo da Vignola</name>, whose services <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name> begged of his friend <name type="pname">Cardinal Alessandro Farnese</name>, as <name type="pname">Vignola</name> was then engaged upon another important garden commission at the Villa Farnese nearby at Caprarola. Construction proceeded over the next decade, and in <date when="1579-08">August 1579</date>, a lavish banquet was given there for <name type="pname">Pope Gregory XIII</name> (papacy <date when="1572">1572</date>&#x2013;<date when="1585">1585</date>), after which the pontiff promptly canceled Gambara's pension. Knowing that Gambara had been appointed by <name type="pname">Pope Gregory</name>'s predecessor, the reform-minded <name type="pname">Pius V</name> (papacy <date when="1566">1566</date>&#x2013;<date when="1572">1572</date>), and that he was a prominent officer of the Inquisition, we may find it strange that he would build opulently, in a style derived from pagan art and literature. That, however, was the men-<lb/>
tality of a proud and wealthy aristocrat whose appointment had as much to do with politics as with piety.</p>
<p>While the garden is the renowned part of Villa Lante and the park is often neglected by visitors, one should tour the <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> first in order to follow the itin-<lb/>
erary planned by <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name>. The <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> evokes the Golden Age myth, investing it with another, that of a punishing flood familiar to readers of the Old Testament. In the classical version, because of human wickedness, Jupiter, like Jehovah in the Hebrew scriptures, became angry and decided to destroy the earth with a flood so mighty that dolphins could be found swimming in the forest. Only two vir-<lb/>
tuous humans were left to repopulate, and their descendants were compelled to labor in order to make the earth fruitful.</p>
<p>The garden spells out the virtues of <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name>, who made the surrounding land more bountiful and, in the tradition of classical civilization, was a patron of the arts enabling the human spirit to reach its highest potential. This, in brief, is the mes-<lb/>
<pb n="143"/>
<pb n="143" type="orig"/>
sage of the park and its adjacent garden. It develops through design, as at the Villa d'Este, the age-old theme of relationship among humans, art, and nature, while symbolically portraying the heroic efforts of one man in bringing the three into such an enriching harmony as to constitute a second Golden Age (figs. 4.21&#x2013;4.27).<ref target="#CH4-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> Thus, the humanistic text encoded in its design program gives, as does that of the contempo-<lb/>
rary Villa d'Este, a literary dimension to the garden experience, and the presence throughout the garden of the cardinal's device in the form of a crayfish (a visual pun matching his family name, <hi rend="italic">Gambara</hi>, with <hi rend="italic">gam-<lb/>
bero</hi>, the word for "crayfish" in Italian) suggests his achievement.</p>
<p>Inspired by a sense of ancient geometry and pro-<lb/>
portion as well as by the iconographic program derived from antique themes, the Villa Lante can be seen in plan as a counterpoint of circles and squares. It is finally this balance and harmony of design, and not the mes-<lb/>
sages of a new Golden Age under <name type="pname">Pius V</name> or <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name>'s prestige in the guise of humanism, that account for the deep pleasure that so many visitors have experienced in viewing it. In creating a hillside garden built upon a clear, strong axis, its several terraces linked by stairs, <name type="pname">Vignola</name> displayed a debt to <name type="pname">Bramante</name>. But he altered and expanded <name type="pname">Bramante</name>'s design means. His axis is aquatic and can only be traveled visually for the most part; one walks alongside it, perceiving it perhaps more powerfully for this very reason. And, instead of the architectural climax of the Belvedere exedra, here the central axis simply melts into nature as it ends in the Fountain of the Deluge.</p>

<q><hi rend="bold">U</hi>pon entering the Villa Lante, one first encounters the Fountain of Pegasus sur-<lb/>
rounded by Muses <hi rend="bold">F</hi>, perhaps derived from the Pegasus on the rock above the Oval Fountain at Villa d'Este. In both, the winged horse's hoof striking the earth gen-<lb/>
erates the Spring of Hippocrene, symbol of the source of artistic creativity (fig. 4.23).</q>
<q>Along one of the diagonal paths through the park was the Fountain of the Acorns, now vanished, which linked the <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> with the Golden Age, since acorns were, according to <name type="pname">Ovid</name>, a staple in the diet of Arcadian man. Another vanished foun-<lb/>
tain, that of Bacchus, evokes <name type="pname">Virgil</name>'s descriptions of the Golden Age when wine was believed to run freely in streams from the ground. Other trellis-surrounded foun-<lb/>
tains depicting unicorns and dragons sym-<lb/>
bolized the life of virtue and helped establish the identity of the park as the earthly paradise. High up the wooded slope there is a gate through which one can enter the garden at its top. There one is con-<lb/>
fronted by the Fountain of the Deluge <hi rend="bold">A</hi>, a fern-encrusted grotto with six openings from which water drips and pours into a basin where two dolphins are swimming, their forms now almost obliterated by veg-<lb/>
etation (fig. 4.24). This refers to <name type="pname">Ovid</name>'s account of the destruction of mankind by flood. Flanking the Fountain of the Deluge, twin dining pavilions, known as the Log-<lb/>
gias of the Muses, bear the name and cray-<lb/>
fish device of <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name>. (The word for crayfish is <hi rend="italic">gambero</hi> in Italian, and his crest is therefore a visual pun referring to his name.) Reinforcing the symbolism of the Deluge, small pipes installed beneath the eaves of the pavilions that frame the Fountain of the Deluge allowed water to rain from above. These also served a sport-<lb/>
ive function, permitting water tricks in which garden visitors were sometimes treated to an unexpected drenching in keeping with the humor of the day. Sym-<lb/>
metrical colonnaded aviaries, modeled probably on descriptions of those in Var-<lb/>
ro's ancient garden, were designed as wings to the Loggias of the Muses, and within them berry-producing plants were grown to attract songbirds.</q>
<q>Around the octagonal Fountain of the Dolphins <hi rend="bold">B</hi>, below some stairs, a stepped ramp leads down to the next terrace. A greatly elongated crawfish, its head and front claws emanating from the middle of the stairs at the top of the ramp and its rear claws hanging over top of the Fountain of the River Gods that stands on the terrace below, forms a <hi rend="italic">catena d'acqua</hi>, or water chain (fig. 4.25; <hi rend="bold">C</hi>). Its linked curves both create and echo the movement of the swirl-<lb/>
ing water that spills over the shallow shell-<lb/>
like basins set within it. Thus, out of the wreck of the Deluge, <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name> can be seen to be harnessing water for human welfare. The water spilling through the beneficent crayfish's claws symbolically becomes the Tiber and the Arno as it falls into the basin flanked by the two great river gods (fig. 4.26). Their cornucopias denote the fertility that water brings to the land, a fertility that is emphasized by the statues of Flora and Pomona standing in niches within the retaining wall near the base of the steps leading from the terrace above. In the middle of this terrace, which is flanked by rows of plane trees, stands the Fountain of the Table. The stone table with its central water channel and bubbling jets provided <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name> and his guests with an experience similar to that of ancient Romans whose banqueting arrangements sometimes included pools upon which ser-<lb/>
vants floated food (see figs. 2.42, 2.46).</q>
<q>The Fountain of Lights <hi rend="bold">D</hi> links the <name type="pname">Cardinal</name>'s dining terrace with the water the-<lb/>
ater below, a concentric construction of upper concave and lower convex steps. One hundred sixty small jets shoot upward from small lamps when the fountain is turned on; water pours from the sides of each step into a channel in the one below. From the terrace of the Fountain of Lights, one gazes down upon a series of garden compartments outlined in boxwood and a central water parterre. Within the water <hi rend="italic">par-<lb/>
terre</hi> <hi rend="bold">E</hi> is a circular island, recalling per-<lb/>
haps the Marine Theater at <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Villa (fig. 4.27; see fig. 2.44). The loggias of the twin <hi rend="italic">palazzine</hi> open onto the garden, and in them one finds frescoes depicting the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, and the Villa Lante itself. In this part of the garden, wild nature has been thor-<lb/>
oughly tamed by art, and <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name> is seen as the patron of this transformation. <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name>'s origi-<lb/>
nal centerpiece of the island terrace, a water-oozing spire (<hi rend="italic">meta sudans</hi>), was replaced in the seventeenth century by four bronze youths holding aloft <name type="pname">Cardinal Ales-<lb/>
sandro Peretti Montalto</name>'s device of three mountains and a star. The surrounding water parterre was meant to evoke an ancient <hi rend="italic">naumachia</hi>, a flooded theater where mock naval battles were held. In each of its four ponds is a small stone boat holding stone arquebusiers. These were engineered to fire jets of water toward the central fountain.</q>

Like the Villa d'Este and Villa Lante, the <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">sacro bosco</hi></name> of Bomarzo is a domain of allusions. Its architecture and sculpture represent various literary themes, not least of which is the theme of the sacred wood itself, a deity-haunted precinct, an Arcadia, or <hi rend="italic">locus amoenus</hi> like those found in <name type="pname">Ovid</name> or <name type="pname">Virgil</name>. One may approach this curi-<lb/>
ous place therefore with a disposition to look for humanistic literary themes, autobiographical and philosophical allusions, a great deal of epigrammatic didacticism, and a fascination with the antique and the exotic such as propels <name type="pname">Colonna</name>'s narrative in the <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</hi>&#x2014;indeed, the same kind of Renaissance appetite for marvels as is found in <name type="pname">Shakespeare</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi>.</p>

<p>Much of the garden's intended meaning is obvi-<lb/>
ously lost upon the modern visitor who is directed to the garden of the Villa Orsini by signs pointing to the "Parco dei Mostri" (Park of Monsters), an invitation for tourists to stop and gawk at a collection of fantas-<lb/>
tic forms, some of which are carved out of the living rock, a soft tufa. Lacking familiarity with the literary symbolism that was the common currency of human-<lb/>
ist intellectuals, one may at first wonder: Is this an exhibition showing the hallucinations of a deranged brain? Is it a sixteenth-century version of Coney Island with some of the twentieth-century amusement park's topsy-turvy atmosphere and penchant for the freakish, the magical, and the macabre?</p>
<p>Although now exploited commercially as a local wonder, the garden at Bomarzo, in fact, provides a fascinating window on the landscape of the Renais-<lb/>
sance. Count Orsini, a renowned military captain and friend of several eminent men of letters, inherited the property at Bomarzo in 1542. Shortly thereafter he married <name type="pname">Giulia Farnese</name> to whom he was apparently deeply devoted, as evidenced by the small temple commemorating her, which is the culmination of the visitor's itinerary through the garden. Interrupted by the count's military campaigns, the building of the <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">sacro bosco</hi></name> nevertheless became his obsession and occupied his imagination until his death in 1585.</p>
<p>Bomarzo's lack of a tautly geometric plan is explained by the fact that it was built by several different architects who attempted to express the owner's literary and personal passions over a long period of time. The result is a closer approximation in spirit to the multivalent, initiatory, and allegorical character of the <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</hi> than per-<lb/>
haps any other Renaissance garden. Its disorganized appearance and the discrepancies in scale among its monuments are further explained by the fact that these fantastic forms were carved from various natu-<lb/>
ral boulders strewn about the site. There is even uncertainty as to the point of entry, although logic points to the northeast corner, where two sphinxes bear legends enjoining the visitor to discern with awe and amazement the marvelous character of the works that lie beyond.</p>
<p>Bomarzo is a unique expression of landscape art, and its inherent theatricality points the way to the dra-<lb/>
matic character of seventeenth-century Baroque design, a stylistic development we will trace in the next chapter. Here we will turn our attention to villas of a different character in which abstract mathematical composition and architectural spatial configuration is much more important than humanist iconography.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Palladian Villas of the Veneto</hi></hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name> (<date when="1508">1508</date>&#x2013;<date when="1580">1580</date>) is one of the most influ-<lb/>
ential figures in the history of architecture because of his famous treatise <hi rend="italic">I quattro libri dell'architettura</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">The Four Books of Architecture</hi> (1570), and the Olym-<lb/>
pian beauty of his work. A stonemason by training, he became the prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; around 1537 of <name type="pname">Giangiorgio Tris-<lb/>
sino</name>, a Venetian humanist who had formed an academy in his villa near Vicenza where young nobles received a classical education. Vicenza is located in the Veneto, the mainland region in the alluvial plains at the foot-<lb/>
hills of the Alps that Venetians refer to as the <hi rend="italic">terra-<lb/>
ferma</hi> where the city-state of <name type="place">Venice</name> had established control beginning in the fourteenth century. Although still a thriving maritime republic, <name type="place">Venice</name> needed a land base as a means of defense and to control its food sup-<lb/>
ply, a prudent investment and sound economy, too, in an inflationary age. In addition, patrician Venetians were attracted to the charms of rural life, or the <hi rend="italic">villeg-<lb/>
giatura</hi>, as they, like other Italians who sojourned out-<lb/>
side <name type="place">Rome</name> and <name type="place">Florence</name>, called their periodic residence at their country estates. Men such as <name type="pname">Daniele Barbaro</name>, another important patron of Palladio's, found precedent for involving themselves in agricultural affairs in the ancient Roman authors <name type="pname">Cato</name>, <name type="pname">Varro</name>, and <name type="pname">Columella</name>. <name type="pname">Trissino</name> was instrumental in helping Palladio initiate his career as an architect with commissions from the nobility of Vicenza for palaces and villas.</p>
<p>In publishing his <hi rend="italic">Quattro libri</hi> <name type="pname">Palladio</name> had as precedent the books of <name type="pname">Sebastiano Serlio</name> (<date when="1475">1475</date>&#x2013;<date when="1554">1554</date>), issued in six parts between 1537 and 1551. Collected and published posthumously in 1584 as <hi rend="italic">L'Architettura</hi>, these treatises codified the five classical orders&#x2014;Doric, Tuscan, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. <name type="pname">Ser-<lb/>
lio</name>'s illustrations were a design resource for <name type="pname">Palladio</name>, and like <name type="pname">Serlio</name>, <name type="pname">Palladio</name> took advantage of <name type="place">Venice</name>'s leadership in the field of printing when he published his own well-illustrated, similarly formatted work. In addi-<lb/>
tion, <name type="pname">Palladio</name> was introduced by <name type="pname">Trissino</name> to the architectural treatise of <name type="pname">Vitruvius</name>, <hi rend="italic">Ten Books of Architecture</hi>, and Barbaro asked him to provide the illustrations for his commentary on this work, which appeared in 1556. <name type="pname">Palladio</name> was, of course, familiar with <name type="pname">Alberti</name>'s treatise, <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>. <name type="pname">Alvise Cornaro</name>, a humanist with an interest in architecture, whom <name type="pname">Palladio</name> met when he lived for a time in Padua, nourished in him a practical approach to design and a respect for <hi rend="italic">santa agricoltura</hi>, blessed agriculture, and the farmers who cultivated the land.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s understanding of classical form was wedded to a profoundly architectural imagination. Adorned with pedimented facades like Roman tem-<lb/>
ples, the villas he built in the Veneto dominate the land-<lb/>
scape in a regal manner. <name type="pname">Palladio</name> considered carefully their position in relationship to the landscape. In Book Two of <hi rend="italic">I quattro libri</hi>, he offered these siting instruc-<lb/>
tions: "Don't build in valleys enclosed between hills because buildings in hidden valleys, apart from being invisible from a distance and having no view them-<lb/>
selves, lack dignity and majesty."<ref target="#CH4-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> As the architectural historian <name type="pname">Caroline Constant</name> explains, <name type="pname">Palladio</name> was interested in scenographic space, or space that is phys-<lb/>
ically discontinuous, an assemblage on the ground plane that is perceptual and therefore unlike perspec-<lb/>
tival space, which is contained and defined by walls. She asserts that "for <name type="pname">Palladio</name> the ground plane was, conceptually, a surface of human manufacture rather than part of the natural world, and hence, a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa</hi>. It served&#x2014;much as the picture plane did for Cub-<lb/>
ism&#x2014;as a base on which to conduct various experi-<lb/>
ments into the nature of three-dimensional form. By elevating the central block of the villa, <name type="pname">Palladio</name> stressed the idealized nature of the ground plane, creating a new ground from which to survey the surrounding domain. Without the building, we would not see the landscape in the same terms; the architecture gathers the land-<lb/>
scape into its domain and redimensions it."<ref target="#CH4-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>For the papal prelate <name type="pname">Daniele Barbaro</name> and his brother, <name type="pname">Marc'Antonio Barbaro</name>, an important Venetian statesman, <name type="pname">Palladio</name> built the Villa Barbaro at Maser (Treviso) in the Veneto on the plain below the Dolo-<lb/>
mite foothills during the decade of the 1550s (fig. 4.30). Built on the foundation of a medieval <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">castello</hi></name>, the villa's projecting main building block has a stuc-<lb/>
coed Roman-templelike facade and is flanked by ser-<lb/>
vice wings that end in dovecotes. These are elegant renditions of local vernacular architecture, as the <hi rend="italic">barchesse</hi>,_or utilitarian farm building, and the dove-<lb/>
cote were typical constructions in the north Italian rural countryside. Unique among the works of <name type="pname">Palladio</name>, the <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi> here is a hemicycle with sculptural niches. <name type="pname">Palladio</name> may have been influenced in its design by such Roman models as the <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name> and <name type="pname">Pirro Ligo-<lb/>
rio</name>'s plans for Villa d'Este, both of which were roughly contemporary with the Villa Barbaro (fig. 4.31). How-<lb/>
ever, the villa has an entirely different relationship to its landscape surroundings than do Roman or Tuscan villas where walls, rather than the ground plane, artic-<lb/>
ulate and contain space. Placed near the juncture of the arable plain and the wooded hillside, the Villa Barbaro at Maser <hi rend="italic">presides</hi> over its landscape, a beautiful object <hi rend="italic">in</hi> space, with space having priority over object, which nonetheless aggrandizes and confers meaning upon its spatial surroundings. Complementing the Palladian architectural and landscape treatment of the Villa Bar-<lb/>
baro are the magnificent frescoes by Veronese (<name type="pname">Paolo Caliari</name>, <date when="1528">1528</date>&#x2013;<date when="1588">1588</date>), which illusionistically amplify interior space with poetically classical landscapes and

</figure>
<p>The reciprocal relationship between Palladian architecture and landscape found at the Villa Barbaro, in which neither gains the upper hand but each gains something from and is enhanced by the other, is even more apparent at the Villa Almerico-Valmarana, called "La Rotonda" or Villa Rotonda, in the rural environs of Vicenza (fig. 4.32). Built between 1565/6 and 1569 for the recently returned papal prelate Paolo Almerico on property he owned outside the city, it may not have been conceived like other nearby villas as a working farm, but merely as a country retreat, although this is a subject of scholarly debate. Villa Rotonda is unusual also in having four pedimented facades, because as <name type="pname">Pal-<lb/>
ladio</name> explained in <hi rend="italic">I quattro libri</hi>, "it enjoys beautiful views on every side."<ref target="#CH4-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> He described the site as a the-<lb/>
ater, and the villa on its slight hill is in its isolation and lack of ancillary structures like a solo performer within the ring of surrounding hills, the focal point of a larger landscape composition.</p>
<p>Because of his ability to scenographically unite serenely aloof, abstract classical forms and rustic sur-<lb/>
roundings, <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s villas have served as models from his time to the present for country villas where land-<lb/>
scape statements harmonizing the inherent tension between human reason and nature have been honored within the imagination of a culture or an individual. Palladian influence was especially strong in eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century <name type="place">England</name> where aristocrats such as <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name> and <name type="pname">Charles Howard</name>, the third earl of <name type="pname">Carl-<lb/>
isle</name>, among others, revered his architectural genius.<ref target="#CH4-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref> The American president <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name> owned four copies of <hi rend="italic">I quattro libri</hi>, and as an architect himself he appreciated and emulated <name type="pname">Palladio</name> when he built his own hilltop residence, Monticello.<ref target="#CH4-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><name type="pname">Palladio</name> as well as his predecessors <name type="pname">Colonna</name>, <name type="pname">Alberti</name>, and <name type="pname">Serlio</name> grasped the importance of printing as a means of transmitting architectural ideas and visual information. As we shall see in this and subsequent chapters, both politics and the printing press carried the currents of humanism and architectural theory from <name type="place">Italy</name> into <name type="place">France</name> and then farther afield. At the same time, design ideas first propounded in garden settings soon influenced what we today call city planning, land-<lb/>
scapes on an urban scale.</p>

<p>The same popes who were adding verdant charm to the edges of the ancient city with the construction of gar-<lb/>
dens such as those of the <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name> and the Villa Mad-<lb/>
ama were simultaneously applying the principles of landscape design to the rebuilding of <name type="place">Rome</name> itself From its ancient imperial pre-eminence as a world capital, <name type="place">Rome</name> had shrunk during the Middle Ages to a popula-<lb/>
tion of 17,000 housed in a tangle of small dwellings huddled in the elbow of the Tiber that lies opposite <name type="pname">Cas-<lb/>
tel Sant'Angelo</name> and the <name type="place">Vatican</name> (fig. 4.33). The third-century Aurelian walls outlined a much larger area. These contained the ruins of the Palatine, the Col-<lb/>
osseum, the great imperial baths, triumphal arches, commemorative columns, and the moldering remains of the Forum where cattle grazed from late antiquity to the eighteenth century. Within this spectral setting of imperial glory several churches and monasteries had been built during the Middle Ages. Only footpaths con-<lb/>
nected them to one another and the urban core beside the Tiber.</p>
<p>After their return from exile in Avignon in 1377, and following the bull of 1439, which granted hierarchi-<lb/>
cal authority to the bishop of <name type="place">Rome</name>, the popes gradually gathered into their hands the reins of munici-pal power, wresting control over urban affairs from the commune and the warring factions of the nobility. The <hi rend="italic">maestri di strada</hi>, equivalent to modern planning commissioners, were brought into the administrative apparatus of the Church. At the same time, the Church acquired the power of eminent domain and the ability to levy improvement taxes on property owners. <name type="place">Rome</name>, already landmark-studded but with no regular street plan, offered a challenging opportunity for the application of the newly redeveloped principles of axial composition. Given the wealth of the Church and its desire to augment its international position during the Counter-Reforma-<lb/>
tion, it is not surprising that a series of popes eagerly embraced this opportunity.</p>

area with the construction of three more straight streets that radiated from the <name type="pname">Piazza Sant'Angelo</name>, thereby creating the first Roman example of a <hi rend="italic">trivio</hi>, a place where three ways meet, a form later employed in lay-<lb/>

When the <name type="pname">Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</name> (ruled <date when="1516">1516</date>&#x2013;<date when="1556">1556</date>) planned to visit the papal city in triumph following his victory over the Turks in Tuni-<lb/>
sia in 1536, <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name> was summoned to turn it into a place of dramatic greeting and Roman pride. The genius with which he carried out his assignment, which was not completed until long after his death, provides us with an incomparable example of the the-<lb/>
atrical imagination at its most sober and profound, for the spatial drama and urban scenography of his <name type="pname">Cam-<lb/>
pidoglio</name> remain unrivaled in the history of urban plan-<lb/>
ning (fig. 4.34).</p>
<p>Considered by ancients Romans to be the <hi rend="italic">caput mundi</hi>, the center of the world, the Capitoline Hill, site of the Palace of the Senator<ref target="#CH4-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref> and still the nominal home of Roman city government, was designated as a major point along the imperial route leading down the old Appian Way and through the Forum to the inhabited city, then across the river at the <name type="pname">Ponte Sant'Angelo</name> to <name type="pname">St. Peter</name>'s and the <name type="place">Vatican</name>. <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>'s commission was to create a dignified new hilltop piazza, despite the austere flank of <name type="pname">Santa Maria</name> in Aracoeli on the north and the old unprepos-<lb/>
sessing medieval guild hall to the south of the Palace of the Senator.</p>

<p>The great equestrian statue of the Roman emperor <name type="pname">Marcus Aurelius</name>, once thought to be a repre-<lb/>
sentation of <name type="pname">Constantine</name>, the first Christian emperor, and therefore saved from being melted down along with many monumental pagan bronzes, was trans-<lb/>
ported to the <name type="pname">Campidoglio</name> from the Lateran Palace, its home throughout the Middle Ages. Set upon <name type="pname">Michel-<lb/>
angelo</name>'s modest yet authoritative pedestal in front of the Palace of the Senator, it served as the calm center and as a spring activating the dramatic tension and tremendous spatial energy of his design.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>'s solution to the incoherent space defined by the perimeter structures of the <name type="pname">Campidoglio</name> was one of camouflage through the design of a pair of opposing twin facades. On the south, that of the Pala-<lb/>
zzo dei Conservatori gave the old medieval guild hall the appearance of a Renaissance structure, and, on the north, that of the Palazzo Nuovo&#x2014;not built until the papacy of <name type="pname">Innocent X</name> (<date when="1644">1644</date>&#x2013;<date when="1655">1655</date>) and now known as the Palazzo del Museo Capitolino (Capitoline Museum)&#x2014;successfully screened the awkward wedge of land beside <name type="pname">Santa Maria</name> in Aracoeli. Although only two stories in height, both fa&#x00E7;ades are given monumentality by <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>'s inventive giant order of pilasters running from the porticoed ground floor to the cornice line. Because the existing guild hall was set at an 80&#x00B0; angle to the Palace of the Senator, he skewed both of his fa&#x00E7;ades 10&#x00B0; from the 90&#x00B0; norm, thereby creating a trapezoidal piazza. The space, though contained, is thereby made dynamic and destabilized, and the eye is allowed to slide past the sides of the Palace of the Senator into the great field of ruins beyond, where the <name type="pname">Campidoglio</name> slopes down to the Forum.</p>
<p>The spatial dynamism is further increased by the paving pattern, a twentieth-century replica of the orig-<lb/>
inal one laid according to <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>'s design. The heroic sculpture sits within a slightly sunken oval and in the middle of a twelve-ray star, the points of which form the coordinates of a radiating design. When read from above, this design gives a spherical appearance to the oval, as if it were a dome and the sculpture its crowning ornament.</p>
<p>But the greatest element of this scenographic
<pb n="151"/>
<pb n="151" type="orig"/>
drama is not the piazza, but the ascent to it via the Cordonata, a broad stair ramp with wide treads that are as gently cadenced as the adjacent steps of <name type="pname">Santa Maria</name> in Aracoeli are penitentially steep (fig. 4.35). Over-life-size ancient Roman statues of the horse tamers, the mythological twins <name type="pname">Castor</name> and <name type="pname">Pollux</name>, excavated in 1560 near the Capitoline, stand at the top, Olympian honor guards with the serene disinterested gaze of immortals, framing the perspective <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name> cre-<lb/>
ated.</p>
<p>In 1561, <name type="pname">Pius IV</name> (papacy <date when="1559">1559</date>&#x2013;<date when="1565">1565</date>) promoted the axial reordering of medieval <name type="place">Rome</name> with the build-<lb/>
ing of the Via Pia (now Via XX Settembre) from the papal palace on the Quirinal to the Porta Nomentana, the city's northeastern gate. <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name> was again summoned to produce an urban design. Here he gave a dignified focus to the palace approach with another monumental pair of sculptures of <name type="pname">Castor</name> and <name type="pname">Pollux</name>, turning their half-tamed horses to face the street near its entrance. At the opposite end, he screened the ancient fortifications of the Porta Nomentana with a purely scenic gate scaled to harmonize with the vista enclosed by the walls of the villa gardens on either side (fig. 4.36).</p>

<p>Although unsurpassed as urban scenography, the <name type="pname">Cam-<lb/>

Indeed, all previous efforts to improve the cityscape of <name type="place">Rome</name> were but overtures to the great symphony of urban improvements that was orchestrated during the short Sistine papal term.</p>

<p>Born of Dalmatian peasant stock, the great future pope of the Counter Reformation, Felice Peretti, rose through the ranks of the Church to become <name type="pname">Cardinal Montalto</name>, building the Villa Montalto with the reve-<lb/>
nues that went with his elevation to high office. There he nurtured his plans during the thirteen years of <name type="pname">Greg-<lb/>
ory XIII</name>'s papacy. Located in the developing eastern suburb of the settled city at the base of the Esquiline Hill on the site of the present railway station, the Villa Montalto later became the hub of a bold urban design. This plan, which Felice commissioned from the archi-<lb/>
tect and engineer Domenico Fontana (<date when="1543">1543</date>&#x2013;<date when="1607">1607</date>) as soon as he was elevated to the papacy, carried the urbanization of <name type="place">Rome</name> to the boundaries of its ancient walls and even, where possible, beyond. No contem-<lb/>

more importantly, its seven major churches, with one another, they inscribed on the face of the ancient city a highly visible itinerary of tourism and pilgrimage that served to enhance its prestige as the original and con-<lb/>

<p>Not since the days of the Roman chariots had equally smooth, wide, and regular urban arteries been built. Moreover, they were to be paved in order to facil-<lb/>
itate the movement of the newly invented spring-sus-<lb/>
pension carriage. As yet, there were no sidewalks, and pedestrians and vehicles occupied the same street space. The word <hi rend="italic">corso</hi>, signifying a principal thorough-<lb/>
fare, assumed new meaning in <name type="place">Rome</name> as carriage driv-<lb/>
ing became a fashionable recreation for the upper echelon of society. The Via Pia, the longest straight road built to that date, bore daily witness to <name type="place">Rome</name>'s pre-em-<lb/>
inence as the world's first city to accommodate these new vehicles in large numbers. <name type="place">Rome</name> indeed was expe-<lb/>
riencing another modern urban "first": traffic conges-<lb/>
tion. The cardinals and their immense ecclesiastical retinues, the dignitaries of the embassies from other countries now posted to <name type="place">Rome</name>, the courtesans, the tens of thousands of pilgrims who came every year, the tour-<lb/>
ist contingent newly awakened to the wonders of the classical past, the foreign artists and artisans&#x2014;all these thronged the city, congesting its narrow medieval byways and crowding its new thoroughfares. The long-slumbering metropolis was once again lively as horses, carriages, cattle, and pedestrians jostled one another in the burgeoning cosmopolitan setting.</p>
<p>But more than roads were needed to facilitate transportation and stimulate the regrowth of <name type="place">Rome</name>. It was necessary to reconstruct the ancient aqueducts if the untenanted, ruin-studded stretches of the city were to be repopulated. Other popes had begun this process, but none had solved the problem of carrying water to the heights of <name type="place">Rome</name>'s famed hills. That was the assign-<lb/>
ment <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> set for himself, and within only eighteen months, the plan he had nurtured for the Acqua Felice (so named because of the pope's first name, Felice) came to fruition with the completion of a conduit span-<lb/>
ning 7 miles of overhead arches and 7 miles of under-<lb/>
ground tunnels. Its successful opening brought water to the Villa Montalto in 1586 and three years later to twen-<lb/>
ty-seven public fountains located throughout <name type="place">Rome</name>. Utilitarian at first, many of these were later transformed into the ornamental fountains for which <name type="place">Rome</name> has remained famous.</p>
<p>The Acqua Felice also made possible the con-<lb/>
struction of a public laundry beside the Baths of Dio-<lb/>
cletian. And where the already reactivated Acqua Vergine brought water to the site of the present Foun-<lb/>
tain of Trevi, <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> installed a basin for the washing of wool.<ref target="#CH4-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref> With the water problem solved and the nexus of the new street system located in the area where he owned property he was in a position to gain financially from his program of public works.</p>
<p>As a landscape designer working at a city-<lb/>
planning scale with a visionary patron, Fontana proved his talent in engineering and urban scenography. Together pope and architect created the skeleton of modern <name type="place">Rome</name>, a circulation network of interconnecting streets and focal points, the whole comprising a series of vista corridors punctuated with landmarks old and new. As with the Acqua Felice, <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> bestowed his name on the longest and most important of these unify-<lb/>
ing thoroughfares, the Strada Felice. This avenue con-<lb/>
nected <name type="pname">Santa Maria Maggiore</name> with <name type="pname">Santa Trinit&#x00E0; dei Monti</name> on the brow of the Pincio Hill. A final stretch downhill to the Piazza del Popolo was never con-<lb/>
structed, and the Spanish Steps linking Santa Trinit&#x00E0; with the Corso below were not built until the eighteenth century. But the Strada Felice's extension on the other side of <name type="pname">Santa Maria Maggiore</name> all the way to Santa Croce in Gerusalemme was carried out, thereby creat-<lb/>
ing a straight span of about 2 miles across the breadth of <name type="place">Rome</name>. Intersecting the Strada Felice at almost a right angle was <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>'s Via Pia, the two creating a symbolical cross, referred to as the "<hi rend="italic">bellissima croce</hi>."</p>
<p>In the fresco of the <name type="place">Rome</name> of <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> one sees the impulse to untangle the tortuous labyrinth of medieval <name type="place">Rome</name> with the Strada Felice and other roads slashing across the built and as-yet-unbuilt landscape. One also sees the celebration of <name type="place">Rome</name>'s incomparable history
<pb n="153"/>
<pb n="153" type="orig"/>
through the new prominence given to its landmarks. In addition to the pilgrimage churches, the Colos-<lb/>
seum and the Columns of <name type="pname">Marcus Aurelius</name> and Tra-<lb/>
jan are focal points of the plan. To set these off, <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> removed the structures around them and regularized the building lines of those remaining to form squares. Elsewhere he created new squares. Fontana and his patron hit upon the happy idea of resurrecting several of the old Egyptian obelisks, exotic souvenirs of ancient campaigns, which had long ago toppled here and there about the city, and using them as markers to center space or temporarily arrest the eye and punctuate its journey along a vista corridor.</p>
<p>The 82-foot-tall obelisk marking <name type="pname">Nero</name>'s race-<lb/>
track near <name type="pname">St. Peter</name>'s had, remarkably, remained standing throughout the Middle Ages next to the south side of the church. Fontana directed the feat of moving this 320-ton monument to its present position in front of <name type="pname">St. Peter</name>'s, thus defining the center of the ovoid piazza, which Bernini later embraced with his great curving fourfold colonnades. Fontana had the obelisk lying in the Circus Maximus erected in the center of the space that became the Piazza del Popolo, giving focus to its converging trident of new streets (fig. 4.38). Two more obelisks were set up along the Strada Felice, one at its midpoint in front of <name type="pname">Santa Maria Maggiore</name>, the other at its southeastern termi-<lb/>
nus in front of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. To incorporate them into the religious symbolism of the Counter-Reformation's triumphant Catholicism, the pope had each of the four Sistine obelisks surmounted with a globe bearing a cross. Thus, an ancient Egyp-<lb/>
tian form, developed to stand in sentinel pairs at tomb entrances, became an isolated freestanding object centering urban open space, a felicitous borrowing that would be copied in other times in other lands, often without the Church's triumphant cross.</p>
<p>Sixteenth-century Italian landscape design not only manifested the humanists' interest in reviving ancient forms and themes, but it also served as a means of asserting prestige and displaying wealth and power. The same humanist iconographies into which were encoded messages of family and personal pride within a garden setting could be applied on an urban scale to proclaim the power of the Church or of a ruler. The garden, in effect, served as a design studio wherein problems of axial layout and scenography were solved in ways that were simultaneously applied to city planning. For example, Fontana's develop-<lb/>
ment of the triangular piazza in front of <name type="pname">Pope Sixtus V</name>'s Villa Montalto as a garden <hi rend="italic">trivio</hi>_with three ave-<lb/>
nues radiating outward from an open space near the Church of <name type="pname">Santa Maria Maggiore</name>, in a manner that both ennobled the entrance to the <hi rend="italic">casino</hi> and sug-<lb/>
gested the breadth of the gardens behind it, shows how closely connected were the principles of land-<lb/>
scape design within and without the garden (fig. 4.39).</p>
<p>This means of stabilizing architectural forms in relationship to a particular setting and suggesting ter-<lb/>
ritorial possession through spatial extension, devel-<lb/>
oped here as part of Fontana's plan for the villa, became a widely used device wherever monumental planning occurred. Fontana's role as city planner is thus pivotal. He conceived the design of the Villa Montalto's <hi rend="italic">trivio</hi> within the comprehensive frame of cityscape. By linking it and other radial compositions of axes, such as those emanating from the <hi rend="italic">trivio</hi> at the Piazza del Popolo, to form a transurban network, he created a plan for an entire city, something that had not occurred in the West since ancient Roman times and then only for colonial cities and not the capital.</p>
<p>As the unification of garden space through axial layout became increasingly the objective of garden designers in the seventeenth century, their royal employers saw the symbolic value of reordering old cities and building new ones according to the same principles. It is not surprising that these principles, which served effectively as a spatial metaphor for princely grandeur and dominion, were eagerly absorbed by ambitious monarchs elsewhere, notably in <name type="place">France</name>. However, before the lessons of <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name>'s plan were applied in an urban setting in that country in the early seventeenth century during the reign of <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> (ruled 1589&#x2013;1610), a gradual process of replacing French medievalism with the new Renais-<lb/>
sance style imported from <name type="place">Italy</name> had necessarily ensued. This stylistic evolution, begun in the Loire Valley, reflected the political relations between the two countries over the course of the sixteenth century as Italian influence in <name type="place">France</name> alternated with the development of an independent French Renaissance style.<ref target="#CH4-n24"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">24</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Italian humanism laid the groundwork for the devel-<lb/>
opment of French garden style in the sixteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. <name type="pname">Alberti</name>'s treatise and the publication in 1546 of a French translation of <name type="pname">Colonna</name>'s influential <hi rend="italic">Hypnero-<lb/>
tomachia Poliphili</hi>, carried certain currents of Renais-<lb/>
sance thought northward. Equally important was the invasion of the kingdom of Naples in 1494 by the <name type="pname">French king Charles VIII</name> (ruled <date when="1470">1470</date>&#x2013;<date when="1498">1498</date>) in an attempt to reassert an old dynastic claim to the throne. <name type="pname">Charles</name>'s occupation lasted only five months, but <name type="pname">Alfonso II</name>'s state-of-the-art gardens at Poggio Reale, overlooking the Bay of Naples and with a view of Mount Vesuvius, made a lasting impression on him and on the nobles in his retinue.</p>
<p>Following the capture of <name type="pname">Castel del Uovo</name>, <name type="pname">Charles</name> took up residence there and had ample oppor-<lb/>
tunity to marvel at the straight <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> approaching the castle on all sides, the orange and other fruit trees sur-<lb/>
rounding it, its large walled garden, ingenious hydrau-<lb/>
lic system, fountains, ornamental fish ponds, canals, aviaries, and game-filled hunting park. Though it has long since disappeared and its design cannot be accu-<lb/>
rately reconstructed, we know that this pleasure palace was square with corner towers and had a sunken court that could be flooded for water spectacles. When <name type="pname">Charles</name> returned to his own palace at <name type="pname">Amboise</name> in October, he brought with him Italian artists and crafts-<lb/>
men, including, the Neapolitan priest-gardener <name type="pname">Pacello de Mercogliano</name>.</p>
<p>The appearance of the palace and garden at <name type="pname">Amboise</name>, as well as that of other great ch&#x00E2;teaux of the Loire Valley, was recorded between 1576 and 1579 by the architect <name type="pname">Jacques Androuet du Cerceau</name> (c. 1520&#x2013;c. 1584) in a monumental series of engrav-<lb/>
ings, which were published in several editions of <hi rend="italic">Les plus excellents Bastiments de <name type="place">France</name></hi>, an invaluable reference work for garden historians inasmuch as almost all sixteenth-century French gardens have disappeared. The work is important, moreover, as a record of the French transformation of Italian Renais-<lb/>
sance gardening principles into a unique design idiom. The ch&#x00E2;teaux engraved by du Cerceau were those that had been built during the several preceding decades of the sixteenth century when French design-<lb/>
ers were appropriating the lessons of <name type="place">Italy</name> and refash-<lb/>

Its design, however, made no attempt to unite the ch&#x00E2;teau and garden visually by aligning them along a common axis as was being done in <name type="place">Italy</name>.</p>
<pb n="155"/>
<pb n="155" type="orig"/>
<p><name type="pname">Louis XII</name> was succeeded by his nephew <name type="pname">Francis I</name> (ruled <date when="1515">1515</date>&#x2013;<date when="1547">1547</date>). The sister-in-law of the new king became the duchess of Ferrara, which, as the home of the Este family's gardens and parks, was an important site of garden design. This connection with <name type="place">Italy</name> per-<lb/>
haps, along with <name type="pname">Francis</name>'s favorable disposition toward the new cultural developments there, fostered the burgeoning French Renaissance.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Francis</name> sought to conquer <name type="place">Italy</name> and become Holy Roman Emperor, but was checked by <name type="pname">Emperor Charles V</name> (who was also king of <name type="place">Spain</name>) in 1525. Upon <name type="pname">Francis I</name>'s return to <name type="place">France</name> the next year, following imprisonment in <name type="place">Spain</name>, he decided to abandon his Loire Valley <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi> and to establish the court in the environs of <name type="place">Paris</name> as part of a political alliance he sought with the bourgeois class. In 1528, he began rebuilding the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> at Fontainebleau (fig. 4.41). The master mason Gilles de Breton was put in charge of the work. He built a new triple-story entrance to the Court of Honor and a new courtyard with an Ital-<lb/>
ian-style gallery overlooking a trapezoidal lake. On the shore opposite the elm-lined causeway leading to the main entrance of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>, the Jardin des Pins was laid out as a series of square beds with a pine-bor-<lb/>
dered central axis.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Francis</name> imported Italian artists to assist in the decoration of Fontainebleau, and the presence of these talented men in <name type="place">France</name> gave additional impetus to the spread of Renaissance art and humanism. <name type="pname">Francesco Primaticcio</name> (<date when="1504">1504</date>&#x2013;<date when="1570">1570</date>), one of the Italian painters and architects summoned to <name type="place">France</name>, is reputed to have designed the grotto at Fontainebleau. In this way, the development of the Renaissance landscape in <name type="place">France</name> continued with direct assistance from designers trained in <name type="place">Italy</name> during the generation in which a new artistic idiom was being forged and refashioned into a style that was identifiably French.</p>
<p>The Italian Renaissance architect <name type="pname">Sebastiano Serlio</name> was also invited to <name type="place">France</name> by <name type="pname">Francis I</name>. Better known as a theoretician and architectural consultant, he is credited with the design of <name type="pname">Ancy-le-Franc</name> in Bur-<lb/>
gundy (fig. 4.42). The project, begun under his direc-<lb/>
tion in 1546, firmly established axial symmetry and the unity between house and garden probably for the first time in <name type="place">France</name>.</p>
<p>The preference for Italian architects and garden designers did not endure for long in <name type="place">France</name>. French national pride was responsible for diverting commis-<lb/>
sions from <name type="pname">Serlio</name> and his compatriots as native design-<lb/>
ers grasped the principles of Renaissance architectural composition. Foremost among the first generation of such designers was <name type="pname">Philibert de l'Orme</name> (c. <date when="1510">1510</date>&#x2013;<date when="1570">1570</date>).

<p>Although he had to preserve the existing house, de l'Orme incorporated it within a symmetrical plan as he applied the lessons he had learned in <name type="place">Italy</name> in a rational, comprehensive ordering of space (fig. 4.43). The garden was enclosed and inward-focused, but its size and impressive surrounding gallery gave it a very modern appearance at the time. Twin pavilions over-<lb/>
looked its far end, and in these musicians played for the king, his mistress, and members of the court. Also at the far end of the garden stood a pavilion for theat-<lb/>
rical entertainment, a new feature of French Renais-<lb/>
sance garden design. As at nearby Gaillon, the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> built in 1502 by <name type="pname">Georges d'Amboise</name>, archbishop of Rouen, the garden pavilion rose from a pool of water.</p>
<p>Ostensibly built as a memorial to <name type="pname">Diane</name>'s late husband, <name type="pname">Anet</name> actually glorified <name type="pname">Diane</name> herself and celebrated her liaison with the king. Not only was this done in typical Renaissance style with monograms and coats of arms fashioned out of boxwood in the garden compartments but also with the kind of deco-<lb/>
rative program seen at the Villa d'Este and the Villa Lante. At <name type="pname">Anet</name>, the thematic program refers to <name type="pname">Diana</name>, goddess of the hunt, in such sculpture as the stag and hounds crowning the main entrance portal and in the elegant Mannerist fountain (now removed from the entry court) depicting a reclining, nude <name type="pname">Diane de Poitiers</name> in the guise of the mythological <name type="pname">Diana</name> (fig. 4.44).</p>
<p>In spite of <name type="pname">Henry II</name>'s attachment to his mistress, he fathered ten children with <name type="pname">Queen Catherine de M&#x00E9;dicis</name>, among them three future kings of <name type="place">France</name>.

The original owner, <name type="pname">Thomas Bohier</name>, had built an enclosed garden with the trellised galleries and square compartments associated with the period of transition between medieval and Renaissance style. It can be seen in the right foreground of du Cerceau's engraving. To the left of the entrance, <name type="pname">Diane</name> of Poitiers ordered a high moat-surrounded terrace on which was laid out a considerably larger rectangular garden of twenty-four beds arranged around a principal cross-axis. Planted with the assistance of the archbishop of Tours, it contained many different kinds of fruit trees, musk roses, lilies, and vegetables. The axis of the bridge de l'Orme had built to span the river extended as a tree-lined <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> to connect with a new garden commissioned by <name type="pname">Catherine de M&#x00E9;dicis</name>. De l'Orme placed the bridge slightly to one side of the main axis of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>, thereby preserving the principal view of the river from the entrance corridor without forsaking an impression of axial linkage.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>During the King's lifetime, <name type="pname">Diane</name> de Poitiers was mistress of the royal <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> at Chenonceaux, dating from 1512 and defensively sited within the river Cher (figs. 4.45, 4.46). After the king's death, <name type="pname">Catherine</name> claimed this remarkable structure for her own. She took an interest in the garden that <name type="pname">Diane</name> had begun and directed the construction of a new south garden. She probably retained <name type="pname">Philibert de l'Orme</name>'s services for this project.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Catherine</name> used the enlarged gardens of Che-<lb/>
nonceaux for political ends, staging elaborate pag-<lb/>
eants and festivals within them to celebrate the peace treaties that punctuated the bloody religious wars that raged during the reigns of her sons. There were festi-<lb/>
vals, too, at Fontainebleau and at the Tuileries. The use of these gardens as settings for various allegorical pageants marked the beginning of an enduring tradi-<lb/>
tion. As will become evident in the next chapter, the gardens of French monarchs increasingly assumed the role of theaters for court life, and certain spaces were built within them to accommodate the specta-<lb/>
cles and plays that were regularly staged as entertain-<lb/>
ments for royalty and nobility. The politicization of the garden was paralleled by the design of cities as didactic expressions of royal prestige as <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> began the impressive transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name> from a medieval to a modern city.</p>

<p>With the extinction of the Valois royal line following the death of <name type="pname">Henry III</name>, the complicated French laws of succession led to the selection of a distant cousin, the Bourbon king of Navarre, as king. The ascension of this Protestant soldier to the throne as <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> in 1589 eventually marked the end of the bloody reli-<lb/>
gious wars of the second half of the sixteenth century, but his authority was established only after a strug-<lb/>
gle. Detennined to quell the rebellious Catholics who denied his legitimacy, <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> first laid siege to their stronghold of <name type="place">Paris</name>, and when this was unsuc-<lb/>
cessful, with his famous pronouncement that <name type="place">Paris</name> was worth a mass, he converted to Catholicism and thereby gained the city. His peripatetic Valois prede-<lb/>
cessors had migrated from one to another of their Loire Valley and <name type="pname">&#x00CE;le-de-France</name> <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi>, chosen principally by individual royal preference for spe-<lb/>
cific hunting parks. But <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> had to consolidate his victory and establish <name type="place">Paris</name> as the indisputable royal capital. He turned his attention to projects that would improve the city's appearance, stimulate its economy, address its issues of public sanitation, and increase its opportunities for both ceremonial state-<lb/>
ment and residential amenity. His campaign to accomplish these objectives was based upon the cre-<lb/>
ation of new architectural works and public spaces larger in scale than any hitherto seen in <name type="place">Europe</name> out-<lb/>
side of <name type="place">Italy</name>&#x2014;spaces that would glorify the institu-<lb/>
tion of monarchy and the growing supremacy of <name type="place">France</name> as the dominant social and political power in <name type="place">Europe</name>. The origin of <name type="place">Paris</name> as a modern city and <name type="place">France</name> as a modern nation owes much to this ener-<lb/>
getic monarch whose list of urban and state achieve-<lb/>
ments would have been even more impressive had his life not been cut short by an assassin in 1610.</p>
<p>The rebuilding of <name type="place">Paris</name>'s badly battered walls was not one of these achievements, nor was it to be counted among those of his successors. With the increasing security of French borders attained by the bastioned outpost citadels constructed first by <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>'s engineers and much later by the brilliant <name type="pname">S&#x00E9;bas-<lb/>
tien Le Prestre de Vauban</name> (<date when="1633">1633</date>&#x2013;<date when="1707">1707</date>), <name type="place">France</name> was becoming territorially confirmed as a nation-state. This meant that <name type="place">Paris</name> could dispense with its ancient fortifications and exist henceforth as an open city. To execute his building program for the capital as well as the border defense fortifications and to supervise the increasingly centralized administration of finances that made such large-scale, nationalistic projects possible in the first place, <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> appointed as his chief minister the duke of <name type="pname">Sully</name>, <name type="pname">Maximilien de B&#x00E9;thune</name> (<date when="1560">1560</date>&#x2013;<date when="1641">1641</date>). Among the several titles he held, <name type="pname">Sully</name> was invested with a newly created one, that of <hi rend="italic">Grand Voyer;</hi> the officer who regulated transportation and integrated planning of all roads, bridges, canals, city streets, and public places. An astute politician and talented administra-<lb/>
tor, <name type="pname">Sully</name> created a revenue budget and organized a corps of engineers to design forts, maintain bridges and roads, and map territory. His road reports led to the building of a centralizing web of highways focused on <name type="place">Paris</name>, while the maps he commissioned not only assisted in increasing royal control over tax-<lb/>
ation, commerce, and transportation, but also pro-<lb/>
moted a new cartographic image of the nation-state as a geographic unit with well-defined boundaries.</p>
<p>For <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>, <name type="pname">Sully</name> played the role that <name type="pname">Colbert</name> would later play for <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>: that of supervising the works that would turn <name type="place">Paris</name> into a dignified royal capital.<ref target="#CH4-n25"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">25</hi></hi></ref> With <name type="pname">Sully</name>'s assistance, <name type="pname">Henry</name> initiated a new urban scale, opened up the city both visually and spatially, and introduced significant preliminary improvements in its circulation. In this effort, mon-<lb/>
arch and minister were clearly inspired by <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name>'s plan for <name type="place">Rome</name>. The result was the reordering of parts of medieval <name type="place">Paris</name> and the creation of new public spaces in conjunction with the development of their surrounding real estate.</p>
<p>The king's first step upon gaining control of <name type="place">Paris</name> was to turn the old stronghold of the Louvre, the fortress castle that his predecessors had already begun to modernize, into a fitting royal residence and symbolically assertive seat of government. Noble architecture alone was not enough to accomplish this task; his_plan, only partially fulfilled during his life, called for the integration of the space between <name type="pname">Cath-<lb/>
erine de M&#x00E9;dicis' Tuileries</name> Palace and the Louvre into one vast courtyard, the largest open space ever before seen or planned in <name type="place">Paris</name> and the precursor of an entirely new urban scale (fig. 4.47).<ref target="#CH4-n26"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">26</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In building the Grande Galerie connecting the two palaces on the south, <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>'s architects removed part of the old fortification wall that ran along the Seine, thereby providing sweeping river views from the palace while simultaneously present-<lb/>
ing it as an object of admiration from afar. Architec-<lb/>
tural improvements to the Tuileries and the removal of much of the medieval clutter of nonroyal struc-<lb/>
tures between it and the Louvre provided the sought-<lb/>
for unity among the southern ranges of the palace complex. But the entire space did not begin to receive
<pb n="159"/>
<pb n="159" type="orig"/>
its final form until the nineteenth century when <name type="pname">Napo-<lb/>
leon</name> built the western half of the northern gallery of the Tuileries and transformed <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>'s New Gar-<lb/>
den between the palace and the Renaissance-era Square Court into a new courtyard with its center-<lb/>
piece, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, placed on axis with that of the Tuileries. (Only with the comple-<lb/>
tion of the rest of the north gallery in the mid-nine-<lb/>
teenth century was the area between the two palaces finally cleared of the clutter of the remaining struc-<lb/>
tures. Then, following a devastating fire in 1871, the Tuileries, with the exception of its end pavilions, was removed, thereby configuring the space as we know it today.)</p>
<p><name type="pname">Henry IV</name>'s urban planning aspirations went beyond royal aggrandizement. He wanted to stimulate the economy of <name type="place">Paris</name> and stem the drain of capital to foreign lands by fostering native production of luxury goods, especially silk. Along the northern edge of the Tuileries Gardens he planted an <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> of mulberry trees, and near the northeastern wall of the city on vacant crown land, the former site of the H&#x00F4;tel Royale des Tournelles, he provided inducements to a group of investors to build a silkworks containing spinning mills and workers' housing.</p>

Because of a drafting error that failed to account for a slight discrepancy in scale when earlier drawings of the Louvre and Tuileries were amalgamated into a new plan of spatial unification, the axes of the two palaces were misaligned. But this problem only became noticeable in the nineteenth century when the intervening structures remaining from medieval <name type="place">Paris</name> were removed. If the axis of the Louvre had been congruent with that of the Tuileries, the Louvre's new entrance, the Pyramid designed by <name type="pname">I. M.

<p><name type="pname">Sully</name> advanced the king's plan to build artisans' residences on the rest of the site, the whole complex forming a square known as the Place Royale (fig. 4.48). To finance the construction of houses on the remaining three sides of the square adjacent to the silkworks, the king donated building lots to his polit-<lb/>
ical allies. The lots were granted with the stipulation
<pb n="160"/>
<pb n="160" type="orig"/>
that the owners build houses according to a predeter-<lb/>
mined uniform facade plan; they could later rent or sell them for a profit. The result was the city's first planned large open space, an early example of urban architectural uniformity. By rewarding his friends with the opportunity to become developers, the king also provided a model and catalyst for later specula-<lb/>
tion in Parisian real estate.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to providing housing attractive to for-<lb/>
eign artisans, the Place Royale (rechristened by <name type="pname">Napo-<lb/>
leon</name> the Place des Vosges, as it is called today) was also planned with a recreational objective. It was to be a place for social promenading, an increasingly popu-<lb/>
lar Parisian pastime with ritual implications that required an architecturally defined setting. Intended for the general populace, not merely for local residents, this new kind of urban space was also meant to be a stage for court ceremonies, jousting tournaments, and public celebrations. In permanent demonstration of this function, a royal pavilion was created in the center of the south side of the square with an arched portal opening from the rue de Birague, the axis of entry.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the investors built residences for themselves and their friends, rather than the housing intended for artisans. Although some artisans did take up residence in the Place Royale, it quickly became an enclave for the nobility, and much of the ground floor space, which had been planned as a shopping arcade, was closed in as new <hi rend="italic">h&#x00F4;tels</hi> were fashioned from two or more units of the original scheme.</p>
<p>Upon discovering the profitability of the residen-<lb/>
tial real estate, the investors in the silkworks requested the king's permission to relocate it and close in the north end of the square with another range of houses in keeping with those on the other three sides. How-<lb/>
ever, because of its ambiguous social intent and in spite of the royal pageants and tournaments held within the square and the placement by <name type="pname">Cardinal Richelieu</name> of an equestrian statue of <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name> in its center, the Place Royale never became fully given over to the nobility, but remained instead a popular resi-<lb/>
dence for an increasingly eclectic group of tenants.</p>
<p>The religious wars of the sixteenth century had defeired a long-cherished plan to span the Seine and provide a direct access to the western end of the &#x00CE;le de la Cit&#x00E9;, home of the Parlement of <name type="place">Paris</name>. To finance the completion of the Pont Neuf, as the new bridge has been called ever since, a tax was imposed on wine. As it was being constructed, the king put forth a scheme for the Place Dauphine, a square in the form of an irregular triangle conforming to the prowlike shape of the end of the island. Opposite the Place Dauphine, a buttressed platform juts westward like a balcony over the river to form a small square on the bridge itself (fig-4.49).</p>
<p>In the cramped walled cities of the period, where land was scarce and the sides of new bridges offered prime building sites as well as a revenue source for their builders, this bridge was an anomaly. The Pont Neuf, like the slightly earlier Ponte Santa Trinit&#x00E0; in <name type="place">Florence</name>, was built without any structures on it, except for a pumping station designed to bring water to the Tuileries. By keeping the bridge clear of struc-<lb/>
tures, the king promoted public appreciation of <name type="place">Paris</name>'s already considerable scenic potential. With its open views in all directions, the bridge offered those cross-<lb/>
ing it the spectacle of the river and its traffic, the Grande Galerie and other structures of the Louvre-Tu-<lb/>
ileries complex rising on its Right Bank, the buildings opposite giving the Left Bank its own archi-<lb/>
tecturally significant character, and, in between, beyond the Palais de Justice where the courts and offices of the Parlement were housed, the spires of Notre Dame at the eastern end of the &#x00CE;le de la Cit&#x00E9;.</p>
<p>As at the Place Royale, the houses at the Place Dauphine were intended for residents of the merchant and artisan classes. However, perhaps to avoid the situation that had occurred at the Place Royale with the amalgamation of the building lots by aristocrats into larger <hi rend="italic">h&#x00F4;tel</hi>-size units, here the king had <name type="pname">Sully</name> convey the entire site to a single developer, his loyal
<pb n="161"/>
<pb n="161" type="orig"/>
follower <name type="pname">Achille de Harlay</name>, the seventy-one-year-old president of the Parlement, whose own house lay adjacent to the future square; <name type="pname">Harlay</name> was obligated to build the housing ensemble as designed for tradesmen within a period of three years or find others who would buy the lots and do so. Although not in strict alignment for reasons of geography, the ensemble&#x2014;bridge, sculpture, and square&#x2014;was conceived as an urbanistic unit, signifying a new integrative approach to the planning of cities, one that exploited the visual relationships of objects in space.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">French Garden Style</hi></hi></head>
<p>The period of <name type="pname">Henry II</name> and <name type="pname">Catherine de M&#x00E9;dicis</name> had been one in which French designers thoroughly assim-<lb/>
ilated the lessons of <name type="place">Italy</name>. During the reign of <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> (<date when="1589">1589</date>&#x2013;<date when="1610">1610</date>) and the lifetime of his queen and widow <name type="pname">Marie de M&#x00E9;dicis</name>, they forged a distinctive garden style, one that nevertheless was firmly rooted in Italian precedent and developed as a translation of the basic vocabulary of Italian design into a native idiom. Because of the king's connection through mar-<lb/>
riage with the <name type="pname">Medici</name> family, the period of his reign marked another wave of Italian influence, sometimes referred to as the Second School of Fontainebleau in recollection of the designers brought north by <name type="pname">Francis I</name> in the 1530s. Beginning in 1598, members of the <name type="pname">Francini</name> family of hydraulic engineers, sent by <name type="pname">Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici</name>, came north bearing knowledge of contemporary <name type="pname">Medici</name> garden design at the Boboli Gardens where <name type="pname">Marie de M&#x00E9;dicis</name> had spent her childhood and where there was a splendid grotto, at <name type="pname">Castello</name> where there was also a fanciful grotto, and at Pratolino where there was a long avenue lined with fountains leading to the villa. They were also familiar with the mechanical equipment needed to propel jets in the contrivances known as <hi rend="italic">giocchi d'aqua</hi>, or water games, found in the gardens of the <name type="pname">Medici</name>, and to pump and manage the flow of water in the foun-<lb/>
tains and other aquatic features that adorned the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, the Villa Lante at Bagnaia, the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, and the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati. In <name type="place">France</name>, they created at <name type="pname">Saint Germaine-<lb/>
en-Laye</name> grottoes and automata modeled on those of the <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at Pratolino. These both frightened and intrigued the Dauphin, the future <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name>, when he was a child growing up at <name type="pname">Saint Germaine-<lb/>
en-Laye</name>. <name type="pname">Alessandro</name> (<name type="pname">Alexandre</name>) <name type="pname">Francini</name> is believed to have designed the ornamental grotto for <name type="pname">Marie de M&#x00E9;dicis</name> in the <name type="place">Luxembourg</name> Gardens, and his 1631 book of architectural drawings contains elaborate ornamental doorways that evidently served as models for several found on French architectural grottoes of the seventeenth century (fig. 4.50). A <name type="pname">French Huguenot</name>, <name type="pname">Salomon de Caus</name> (1576?&#x2013;1626), who traveled extensively in <name type="place">Italy</name>, published his treatise on garden hydraulics, <hi rend="italic">Les Raisons des forces mou-<lb/>
vantes</hi> in 1615, when the enthusiasm for automata had begun to wane.</p>
<p>Although the grotto, the ornamental cascade, the architectural fountain, and the fountain arrangement known as a <hi rend="italic">buffet d'eau</hi> remained in vogue as French garden style matured under <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, the ingenious Italian-derived hydraulics that were fashionable in the time of <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> and <name type="pname">Marie de M&#x00E9;dicis</name> fell into dis-<lb/>
use. As <name type="place">France</name> readied itself to become the supreme European power in the second half of the seventeenth century, French designers, having thoroughly incor-<lb/>
porated Italian influence, codified&#x2014;through treatises on garden theory and in engravings published in pat-<lb/>
tern books&#x2014;their own distinctive and subsequently influential style of landscape design. Perhaps the most original feature of the new French garden was the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi>, an embroidery like design of decorative scrolls, palmettes, and arabesques in herbs, boxwood, or clipped grass, often with the addition of a monogram, which replaced the geometrically con-<lb/>
figured beds in Italian gardens (fig. 4.51). Several <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> patterns are found in the <hi rend="italic">Trait&#x00E9; du jardinage selon les raisons de la nature et de l'art</hi> (1638) by <name type="pname">Jacques Boyceau de la Baraudi&#x00E8;re</name>, <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Le Jardin de plaisir</hi> (1651), and <name type="pname">Claude Mollet</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Le Th&#x00E9;atre des plans et jardinages</hi> (1652).</p>

<p>The Mollets were royal gardeners residing and working in the Tuileries, along with members of the <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and <name type="pname">Desgots</name> families, who also formed sev-<lb/>

crown. Under their care the Tuileries became a kind of laboratory in which the French garden style, with its axial <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi>, intricate <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi>, clipped cone-shaped yews and space-defining tall hedges, called <hi rend="italic">palissades</hi>, was matured and perfected (fig. 4.52).</p>

<p><name type="pname">Jacques Boyceau</name> was not a gardener in the same practical mold as these. He was a <name type="pname">Huguenot</name> warrior and aristocratic intellectual who had been made an official of the king's chamber even before he was granted the posi-<lb/>
tion of <hi rend="italic">intendant-general</hi> of the king's gardens, including those of the <name type="place">Luxembourg</name> Palace (figs. 4.53, 4.54). A friend of some of the most notable intellectuals of his day, he aimed to produce in his <hi rend="italic">Trait&#x00E9;</hi> something more signif-<lb/>
icant than a trade book. Like <name type="pname">Alberti</name> before him, he found in nature's forms the perfection and symmetries to guide human artistic creation. The mastery of these laws, or at least a thorough practical acquaintance with them, formed for him one of the essential ingredients of the gardener's education. <name type="pname">Boyceau</name>'s chief importance to the history of landscape design is his role in articulating the principles governing a new landscape idiom and the influence he exerted in supervising such talented practi-<lb/>
tioners as the Mollets and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tres</name>.</p>
<p>In addition to furnishing many elegant parterre pat-<lb/>
terns, <name type="pname">Boyceau</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Trait&#x00E9; du jardinage</hi> enunciated what might be called the first professional curriculum of land-<lb/>
scape design, thereby recognizing gardenmaking as a
<pb n="163"/>
<pb n="163" type="orig"/>
distinct profession. Trained gardeners, according to <name type="pname">Boyceau</name>, needed instruction in geometry, drafts-<lb/>
manship, architecture, and aesthetics besides learn-<lb/>
ing practical horticulture through apprenticeship. He sought to instill in them through this curriculum a thorough understanding of perspective and pro-<lb/>
portion. His work both laid the groundwork for future developments in French landscape design and exemplified the developments that had taken place in <name type="place">France</name> during the past century as the les-<lb/>
sons of <name type="place">Italy</name> were thoroughly absorbed. With its confident repertoire of patterns for elaborate <hi rend="italic">par-<lb/>
terres</hi> of boxwood "embroidery" and axial means of organizing landscape space, his treatise served <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s royal gardener <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> so well that the latter never felt compelled to write a treatise of his own.</p>

There is a fine sense of proportion in the relationship of path width to <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">palissade</hi>, a generosity of scale, the manipulation of the ground plane for optical effect, calculated diversity within a framework of carefully balanced symmetry, and the use of eye-catching features&#x2014;fountains, sculpture, orange trees in boxes, balustrades, and stairs&#x2014;to break up space with rhythmical accents, thereby creating measurability.</figDesc>

</figure>
<p>In seventeenth-century <name type="place">France</name>, the nature of monarchy changed in a functional way Feudal kings in the late Middle Ages had trav-<lb/>
eled with their retinues, holding court in castles scattered through-<lb/>
out their kingdoms or enjoying the hospitality of vassal lords. The Renaissance princes of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were peripatetic, enjoying the pleasures of the hunt in several royal forests and performing affairs of state while entertaining in the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi> of the Loire Valley and the <name type="pname">&#x00CE;le de France</name>, some of which we examined in the previous chapter. It was not until the rule of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> (ruled <date when="1643">1643</date>&#x2013;<date when="1715">1715</date>) that this situation changed. Although the king and his retinue traveled to various royal seats&#x2014;Fontainebleau, <name type="pname">Saint-<lb/>
Germain-en-Laye</name>, <name type="pname">Chambord</name>, and, later, <name type="pname">Marly</name>&#x2014;residing in these for considerable periods of time, the court of <name type="place">France</name> increasingly revolved in the orbit of Versailles, as <name type="pname">Louis</name>'s attachment to his father's old hunting lodge and his determination to make it the radiant cen-<lb/>
ter and symbol of his reign grew. It was here that a distinctive style expressing authoritarian order and elegant rationality matured.</p>
<p>This style might never have gained pre-eminence as an inter-<lb/>
national design idiom had not <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> heeded <name type="pname">Cardinal Jules Mazarin</name>'s deathbed recommendation and appointed <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste Colbert</name> (<date when="1619">1619</date>&#x2013;<date when="1683">1683</date>) as his finance minister. <name type="pname">Colbert</name> soon reformed the system of taxation, making it more honest, and during the first part of the king's long reign, <name type="pname">Colbert</name>'s brilliant reorganization of finance and industry increased the prosperity of <name type="place">France</name>. <name type="pname">Louis</name> was able during most of his reign to enjoy its benefits and turn them to both personal and national advantage.</p>
<p>Through the elevation of all the arts to new heights of excel-<lb/>
lence, as well as through astute political diplomacy, <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> estab-<lb/>
lished <name type="place">France</name> as the leading power in <name type="place">Europe</name>, making it a great state and also the exemplar of style. Both <name type="pname">Colbert</name> and the king understood well the role that all the arts, especially the fine arts&#x2014;architecture, painting, and sculpture&#x2014;would play in that process. <name type="pname">Colbert</name> belonged to the prestigious Acad&#x00E9;mie Fran&#x00E7;aise, estab-<lb/>
lished by <name type="pname">Cardinal Richelieu</name> and incorporated in 1635, and was instrumental in founding several academies for the advancement of the arts and sciences. The establishment of these ushered in an era of important building projects sponsored by the king.<ref target="#CH5-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The king gave dance, music, and theater new dignity and sta-<lb/>
tus. He founded the Acad&#x00E9;mie Royale de Danse in 1661, and the Acad&#x00E9;mie Royale de Musique (the <name type="place">Paris</name> Opera) in 1669. Moli&#x00E8;re's troupe of actors was the precursor of the Com&#x00E9;die Fran&#x00E7;aise, which was officially chartered by the king in 1680. <name type="pname">Louis</name> himself was a dancer and performed in several ballets in his youth. Thus, <name type="pname">Louis</name> over the years, with the assistance of <name type="pname">Colbert</name>, supported and insti-<lb/>
tutionalized the diverse talents that were responsible for forging a rich and sophisticated culture within which the French seventeenth-<lb/>
century style flourished as a powerful political and social statement and tangible manifestation of the power and glory of monarchy.</p>
<p>We have seen how readily the French appropriated the idiom of the Italian Renaissance and how thoroughly they transformed it into a style with a distinctly French inflection. Building upon this French Renaissance style, the architects and planners who served <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> now took inspiration from contemporary Italian Baroque art and architecture, adapting it into yet another distinc-<lb/>
tive style. It is a style of sober grandeur, which is differentiated from the robust plasticity and exuberant theatricality of its Italian mod-<lb/>
els by its linear elegance and by the application of mathematical principles to produce designs of eminent rationality.</p>
<p>There was a moment, however, at the beginning of the young king's reign when this outcome may have been in doubt. <name type="pname">Colbert</name> understood that work on the unfinished Louvre Palace should be recommenced as a first major building project of the new regime. In 1665, displeased with the plans submitted by French architects, he summoned to <name type="place">Paris</name> the distinguished Italian architect and sculp-<lb/>
<pb n="166"/>
<pb n="166" type="orig"/>
tor <name type="pname">Gianlorenzo Bernini</name> (<date when="1598">1598</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680">1680</date>) in order to commission a design that would glorify the young king with the same kind of dynamic, robustly theatrical architecture that Bernini had brought to papal <name type="place">Rome</name>. But the Italian's three proposals, vast in scale, would have demolished the existing palace. His solution, moreover, although also neoclassical in its inspiration, would have taken French architectural aesthetics in a dynamically Baroque direction rather than the more chaste one advocated by the king's advisors.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Louis</name>, ceding to <name type="pname">Colbert</name>'s counsel after several months of consideration, dismissed Bernini's proposals and put the problem in the hands of a committee consisting of <name type="pname">Claude Perrault</name> (<date when="1613">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688">1688</date>), an expert on the architecture of antiquity, the archi-<lb/>
tect <name type="pname">Louis Le Vau</name> (<date when="1612">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1670">1670</date>), and the painter <name type="pname">Charles Le Brun</name> (<date when="1619">1619</date>&#x2013;<date when="1690">1690</date>). The East Front of the Louvre, which represents the solution their collaboration produced, has a central Roman-style pavilion, colonnaded wings with paired columns, and symmetrical pavilions at each end. The whole architectural composition is upheld by a ground-floor podium. In choosing an architectural vocabulary that directly linked <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> symbolically with the might of imperial <name type="place">Rome</name>, especially with the cool Olympian grandeur of the classicizing styles of emperors <name type="pname">Augustus</name> and <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>, the Louvre design committee substituted its own brand of neoclassicism for that of the Italian Baroque. Even though the architects who worked for <name type="pname">Louis</name> used such Italian Baroque forms as high domes and curving walls with verve and skill, the path of austere grandeur that is represented by the term <hi rend="italic">French classicism</hi> is one that they never relinquished, and the Baroque elements that they did appropriate were submitted to its firm authority.</p>
<p>Except for the Louvre and a few other projects, <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, unlike <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>, took only a secondary interest in beautifying the capital, concentrating instead upon making the palace and gardens of Versailles into a cynosure of universal renown. That he was able to accomplish this astonishing feat is due not only to the circum-<lb/>
stances of patronage that he and <name type="pname">Colbert</name> established but also to the presence of genius at his side. That genius belonged to a remark-<lb/>
able generation of French designers, in the front rank of whom stood <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> (<date when="1613">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1700">1700</date>), a man who throughout his long life was honored to bear the title of king's gardener.</p>
<p>In <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s hands, Renaissance garden style&#x2014;which we today frequently characterize as "formal"&#x2014;assumed a new scale and, as it did so, forsook small-scale compartmentalization and intri-<lb/>
cate effects in favor of unified spatial composition and monumen-<lb/>
tality expressive of the evolving French style of regal grandeur in landscape terms. Formal order was made to merge with nature, and boundaries appeared to dissolve into distant prospects. The walled gardens of <name type="pname">Catherine de M&#x00E9;dicis</name>, though large by Renais-<lb/>
sance standards, were suddenly dwarfed by the dimensions of the new gardens. The former are composed of axially arranged, visi-<lb/>
bly contained spaces, inwardly focused and walled, whereas the lat-<lb/>
ter are commensurate with their illusion of limitlessness&#x2014;that is, large enough to have distant and generally imperceptible bound-<lb/>
aries and axes that carry the eye to the horizon line.</p>
<p>This illusion of indeterminate axial extension provides a landscape analogue to the spatial concepts of <name type="pname">Ren&#x00E9; Descartes</name> (<date when="1596">1596</date>&#x2013;<date when="1650">1650</date>), the French philosopher, mathematician, and founder of analytical geometry. <name type="pname">Descartes</name> believed that starting from skep-<lb/>
ticism the human intellect could comprehend the mathematical principles underlying God's creation. His rigorous methodology viewed the natural world in mechanistic terms, as objectively meas-<lb/>
urable. With <name type="pname">Descartes</name>, the scientific enterprise itself became boundless, and this new mode of open-ended inquiry helped estab-<lb/>
lish fresh cosmological premises. The seventeenth-century cos-<lb/>
mology, which <name type="pname">Descartes</name>'s philosophy synthesized, provided the groundwork for modern physics. <name type="pname">Descartes</name> built his cosmology on that of the German astronomer, physicist, and mathematician <name type="pname">Johannes Kepler</name> (<date when="1571">1571</date>&#x2013;<date when="1630">1630</date>), who explained how planets moved in eliptical orbits. To <name type="pname">Kepler</name>'s theories <name type="pname">Descartes</name> added the concept of a heliocentric universe previously expounded by the Polish astronomer <name type="pname">Nicolaus Copernicus</name> (<date when="1473">1473</date>&#x2013;<date when="1543">1543</date>). Because of the invention of the telescope by <name type="pname">Galileo Galilei</name> (<date when="1564">1564</date>&#x2013;<date when="1642">1642</date>), the uni-<lb/>
verse was now known to be much vaster than previously imagined. <name type="pname">Descartes</name> held that space was indefinitely divisible and that all movement is in a straight line. Accordingly, extension (<hi rend="italic">extensio</hi>) is the essence of both space and matter, which are equated with each other and which determine the nature of quantity, dimension, and the measurement of distance. This meant in effect the abandon-<lb/>
ment of the Aristotelian notion of <hi rend="italic">topos</hi>, the idea that place is coter-<lb/>
minous with contained and defined space. Cartesian space, by contrast, is boundless and, with regard to the concept of place, value-neutral, since space could now be conceived as a universal grid of mathematical coordinates with places existing merely as locational points along its infinitely extensible planes.<ref target="#CH5-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In this view, place is secondary to matter and space. Its nondis-<lb/>
tinctive status helps account for the abstract character of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s designs, which express <name type="pname">Descartes</name>'s attempt to geometricize all nature rather than to explicate <hi rend="italic">topos</hi>. The geometric formality of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s designs is also due to his employment of Cartesian ana-<lb/>
lytic geometry as a practical compositional tool; the precisely cal-<lb/>
culated proportions of their component parts and his calculation of the effects of perspective on the viewer manifest an under-<lb/>
standing of Cartesian mathematics. Although <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> may not have intended explicitly to portray the Cartesian vision of helio-<lb/>
centric cosmic space, an impossibility in any case, Cartesian phi-<lb/>
losophy is implicit in the indefinitely extended axes of the serenely grand gardens he designed for <name type="place">France</name>'s Sun King.</p>
<p>In addition to giving expression to a new cosmology, <name type="pname">Descartes</name> assisted in the overthrow of Aristotelian Scholasticism by espousing a philosophy based upon the belief that the human mind could, through deductive reasoning, grasp and control the world. The optimism inherent in the Cartesian belief that, through their own powers of intellect, human beings could master the inner workings of nature and direct these toward progressive ends is echoed by the confident grandeur of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s gardens. It was the Sun King's duty to symbolize in his divinely appointed person and to project through his royal authority <name type="place">France</name>'s position as the intel-<lb/>
lectual leader of the modern Western world, and it was <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s job to portray this absolute power through landscape design. Both king and gardener realized, however, the difference between
<pb n="167"/>
<pb n="167" type="orig"/>
reality and suggestion. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> created a garden that implied rationality yet was based on an illusion, human dominance over nature; for his part, the king realized the limits of rationalism as a tool of power and means to accomplish his political goals in a world filled with passion and intrigue.<ref target="#CH5-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>While it is often assumed that <name type="pname">William Kent</name> in eighteenth-<lb/>
century <name type="place">England</name> was the first designer to "leap the wall" of the gar-<lb/>
den to embrace all of nature, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, operating under the cultural influence of <name type="pname">Descartes</name>, had performed this feat nearly a century earlier. But unlike the naturalistic style of the English garden formu-<lb/>
lated by <name type="pname">Kent</name> and his followers, the confident, world-embracing idiom of the French classical style with its extended axes and geo-<lb/>
metrically derived layouts celebrated absolute monarchy, not lib-<lb/>
ertarian values.</p>
<p>The work of transforming ordinary countryside into stepped terraces, grand canals, artificial cascades, and axial promenades was accomplished at the price of villages and fields laid waste and peas-<lb/>
ants relocated. It was also achieved at a huge monetary cost, even at the low prevailing wage rates. It was certainly seen as impressive just for that reason; the enormous expenditure was an important aspect of the seventeenth-century French gardens' message, demonstrating the king's economic power and superior taste. Fur-<lb/>
thermore, these gardens were designed to serve as stages upon which the members of an aristocratic society played out the dra-<lb/>
mas of their lives with theatrical ritual as they met one another upon balustraded terraces, walked along sweeping <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi>, or trysted within the relative privacy of <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi>.</p>
<p>Theaters of social life, the gardens of seventeenth-century <name type="place">France</name> often served as real stages for the performing arts. Within them, concerts, ballets, plays, fireworks, and banquets took place with increasing regularity. Theatrical entertainments were part of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s means of keeping an otherwise bored nobility in check. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> knew the composer <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste Lully</name> (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687">1687</date>) and the playwright <name type="pname">Moli&#x00E8;re</name> (<name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste Poquelin</name>, <date when="1622">1622</date>&#x2013;<date when="1675">1675</date>) and organized his spaces with their performance requirements in mind.</p>
<p>French classical gardens were theatrical in yet another sense. Had they been merely expositions of Cartesian logic, elegantly defined empty stages for aristocratic intercourse and entertainment, they would have been boring. But with their abundant water jets and populations of stone gods and goddesses, they provided the spectator with movement and a rich mythological companionship. Like the Renaissance villa gardens of <name type="place">Italy</name> from which they are derived, they were programmatic texts in stone, water, and vege-<lb/>
tation. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his collaborators (notably <name type="pname">Le Brun</name>, whose express charge was the sculptural program of the gardens at Vaux-<lb/>
le-Vicomte and Versailles) had a sufficient humanistic education to continue the Renaissance practice of garden arrangement accord-<lb/>
ing to elaborate programs of allegorical allusion.</p>
<p>The elegant rationality of the style <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> forged in col-<lb/>
laboration with the architects, artists, and artisans of his day influ-<lb/>
enced courts throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>. Just as <name type="place">France</name> under <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> became the dominant military power in <name type="place">Europe</name>, so the French clas-<lb/>
sical landscape style became prevalent during and after his reign. Although inflected according to regional conditions of taste and topography, it rapidly spread to the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, <name type="place">England</name>, <name type="place">Ger-<lb/>
many</name>, and <name type="place">Russia</name>.</p>
<p>The French classical garden was influential even in <name type="place">Italy</name>, as is apparent a century later in the scale and plan of the royal gardens of Caserta near Naples. But Italian landscape design was so imbued with the robust theatricality of local taste that French classicism was never thoroughly integrated into it. Rather, the currents of Ital-<lb/>
ian Baroque style continued to flow northward as various Euro-<lb/>
pean monarchs and princes summoned artists and craftsmen to mingle their talents with those of French designers. In <name type="place">Italy</name> itself, a wealthy clergy and its related aristocracy brought the art of villa garden building to a triumphant and spectacular close. Humanis-<lb/>
tic iconography, at first in the service of the princes of the church and state, was finally abandoned altogether and ornament became an end in its own right. Thus, the elaborate symbolical programs that informed such gardens as the Villa d'Este gave way to the kind of sculptural tableaux one finds at Caserta (see fig. 41).</p>
<p>Grand-scale geometrical landscape composition in the French manner initiated another tradition, that of monumental city plan-<lb/>
ning, beginning already in the time of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> and carried for-<lb/>
ward in the eighteenth century in <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name> and <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, as discussed in the next chapter, and in the nineteenth century, most spectacularly in <name type="place">Paris</name> itself, as we shall see in Chap-<lb/>
ter Ten. And although they may work with an entirely contempo-<lb/>
rary sensibility and no longer have as their primary philosophical reference the Cartesian cosmological view that was a principal <hi rend="italic">rai-<lb/>
son d'&#x00EA;tre</hi> for axial extension in the seventeenth century, many of today's French landscape designers stand squarely in <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s long shadow as they rebuild the public spaces of <name type="place">Paris</name> and other French cities. For all of these reasons it is worthwhile to examine more closely the career of this remarkable royal servant.</p>

<p>By luck, <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> was born at the moment when all the fashionable and newly wealthy men of seventeenth-century <name type="place">France</name>, following <name type="pname">Cardinal Richelieu</name>'s example, sought to display their taste and status in an increasingly grand manner and on an increasingly lavish scale by constructing new <hi rend="italic">h&#x00F4;tels</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi> or extensively remodeling old ones. As these city mansions and country estates were fur-<lb/>
nished with gardens, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> obtained many com-<lb/>
missions during his long professional life.</p>
<p>It was not only royalty and the nobility who were in a position to offer <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> commissions; the new financial elite, the <hi rend="italic">surintendants</hi> and <hi rend="italic">intendants</hi>, who were in charge of collecting taxes and main-<lb/>
taining the country's finances and administration, formed a class that rose to prominence during the decades when the old nobility's wealth was declining after prolonged religious and civil wars. The newly wealthy professional administrators were sufficiently enriched to own property of a scale to demand the services of architects and landscape designers, thus providing opportunities to consolidate the previous century's experiments.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s Predecessors and Teachers</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois Mansart</name> (<date when="1598">1598</date>&#x2013;<date when="1666">1666</date>) was the most original architect and garden designer among <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s immediate predecessors, carrying Italian Renaissance axial planning to a new scale.<ref target="#CH5-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref> This design achieve-<lb/>
ment had a cultural basis. As human confidence and the desire to dominate nature increased in the seven-<lb/>
teenth century with the opening of new continents through exploration and the expansion of mental hori-<lb/>
zons through science, <name type="pname">Mansart</name> grasped the possibility of projecting the garden outward in an open-armed gesture of seemingly illimitable axial extension. He stretched axes in long perspective lines emanating from, and converging upon, the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>. At <name type="pname">Maisons</name>, <name type="pname">Berny Balleroy</name>, <name type="pname">Fresnes</name>, <name type="pname">Petit Bourg</name>, <name type="pname">Gesvres</name>, and else-<lb/>
where, he elaborated approaches and forecourts, run-<lb/>
ning axial vistas through village and forest (fig. 5.1). He and his followers placed the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> within a field of successive sight lines, dramatically revealing it along intersecting axes.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Jacques Lemercier</name> (<date when="1585">1585</date>&#x2013;<date when="1654">1654</date>), the architect employed by <name type="pname">Cardinal Richelieu</name> on several projects,
<pb n="169"/>
<pb n="169" type="orig"/>
was also an important influence for the young <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>. <name type="pname">Lemercier</name>'s commissions from the cardinal included his country retreat, Rueil, where he built an impressive architectural cascade, and the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and new town that bore the cardinal's name. At <name type="pname">Richelieu</name>, <name type="pname">Lemercier</name> laid out an abstract grid that encompassed the extensive grounds of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and canalized the river Mable as an important cross axis (fig. 5.2). This early application of Cartesian geometry to land-<lb/>
scape design helped set the course that <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> would follow and perfect.</p>
<p>In his youth, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> may have worked with <name type="pname">Mansart</name>; it is clear that his genius owes a debt to that of this temperamental and arrogant master builder. But <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s pivotal, enduring accomplishment had much deeper sources than this purported appren-<lb/>
ticeship. Indeed, history offers few examples of the marriage of vocational destiny, natural genius, and opportunity more complete than that of <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>. His grandfather, <name type="pname">Pierre</name>, had been <hi rend="italic">Ma&#x00EE;tre Jar-<lb/>
dinier</hi> in the service of <name type="pname">Catherine de M&#x00E9;dicis</name>, and his father, <name type="pname">Jean</name>, held the title of <hi rend="italic">Premier Jardinier du Roi</hi>. Born in the gardeners' quarters of the Tuileries Gar-<lb/>
dens in 1613, <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9;</name> grew up constantly exposed to his future profession. The companions of his infancy and childhood were members of the Mollet and Des-<lb/>
gots families, gardeners who were also lodged in the Tuileries. Ties of closest friendship and even marriage knit their members into a solid professional clan.</p>
<p>Not only did <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> inherit his father's title upon the latter's retirement, but, more important, he displayed a quick intellect in receiving the education to which his father directed him. That education was the one prescribed by <name type="pname">Jacques Boyceau</name> in his treatise of 1638; it incorporated among other things the means to give physical form to Cartesian rationality through newly formulated laws of geometry, per-<lb/>
xspective, and optics.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s education also included a sensory approach to, and appreciation of, line, proportion, and color, which he acquired during his apprentice-<lb/>
ship in the studio of the painter <name type="pname">Simon Vouet</name> (<date when="1590">1590</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649">1649</date>). The fact that <name type="pname">Jean Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, his father, placed him with <name type="pname">Vouet</name> in order to develop his drafts-<lb/>
manship and general aesthetic perceptions illustrates the position landscape gardening now occupied in relation to the fine arts. Later, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> became a notable connoisseur and collector of works of art.<ref target="#CH5-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In addition to his training with <name type="pname">Vouet</name>, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> seems to have received a sound education in archi-<lb/>
tecture. It is likely that he was instructed by both <name type="pname">Mansart</name> and <name type="pname">Lemercier</name>. Certainly, his gardens are so imbued with architectural principles and architectural intelligence that it would have been impossible for <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> to have designed them without a thorough aca-<lb/>
demic training in architecture. Endowed with practi-<lb/>
cal experience from his earliest years as well as per-<lb/>
sonal gifts and technical skills that enabled him to be more than a talented practitioner of a well-respected craft, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> took on the task of transforming the tenets of French Renaissance garden design into a new idiom.</p>

<p>Shortly after <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> took over the reins of government, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had the good fortune to have as a client the king's minister of finance, the ambi-<lb/>

cated client's eye and discernment to the collaborative process necessary for realizing a notable design. Like other passionate builders, he was willing to spare no expense to achieve perfection. Thus equipped by taste and temperament and enriched by the emolu-<lb/>
ments of office, <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> approached, at the age of forty-one, the task of creating the monument of his brilliance and also of his doom, Vaux-le-Vicomte, the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and garden that epitomize the French classi-<lb/>

<p>Lying within the broad agricultural plain that is the predominant landscape of the &#x00CE;le de <name type="place">France</name>, Vaux-le-<lb/>
Vicomte was a small estate that <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> had inher-<lb/>
ited in 1640 from his father. It was an unremarkable piece of countryside, bereft of the topographical drama of contemporary villa gardens in <name type="place">Italy</name>, where patrons and designers sought hillside sites because they considered them inherently salubrious and sce-<lb/>
nic. Such manipulations of topography as were nec-<lb/>
essary to realize the design of Vaux-le-Vicomte would have to be achieved by brute labor.</p>
<p>Expectation and surprise&#x2014;or, put another way, rationality and mystery&#x2014;are both present in a mas-<lb/>
terpiece of landscape architecture. Vaux-le-Vicomte is rich in both elements. It has a plan of complete

</figure>
<q><hi rend="bold">V</hi>aux-le-Vicomte opens up like a play in several acts. There is, first, the drama of entry that many visitors approaching from the modern parking lot are apt to miss. Approaching instead along the central axis, which runs through the mid-<lb/>
dle of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and the garden beyond it, one walks down a slight incline toward a beautiful grille punctuated at intervals with tall stone herms and termi-<lb/>
nated by symmetrical pedimented pseudoportals. The moat is sunk well below the balusters, and its sudden appearance produces the first of many grade-manipulated surprises. Only as one attempts to follow visually one of the arms of the moat around the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> can one guess that the elaborate screen of grille, pseudoportals, and service build-<lb/>
ings has been masking something mag-<lb/>
nificent beyond.</q>
<q>Standing at the entrance to the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>, one now can see on either side verdant grass <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, the edges of which are punctuated with yews clipped into precise identical cones, and, through the far windows of the central pavilion, one glimpses more manicured verdure. With the same anticipation that is to be felt upon the rising of the curtain in a the-<lb/>
ater, one walks through the central vestibule and oval salon out to the ter-<lb/>
race. There lie the <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi>, parallel beds of box and gravel patterned like brocade (fig. 5.4). Fountains, pools, sculpture, topiary, hedges, and trees are all laid out along a grand central axis that finally turns from graveled promenade into a grassy ramp upon which stands a colossal gilded <name type="pname">Hercules</name>, symbol of virtu-<lb/>
ous strength and intended somewhat arrogantly by <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> as a reference to himself (fig. 5.7). Still this axis continues banked by forest groves, until it seems to melt into the luminous sky.</q>
<q>Strolling along the central axis one finds changes in level that were not apparent at first. The axis, from succes-<lb/>
sive vantage points, extending from the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> all along the distance of the central promenade, deceptively appears to flow in one unbroken sweep to meet the grassy ramp and gilded <name type="pname">Hercules</name>; in fact. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> has manipulated the ground plane to produce several surpris-<lb/>
ing results.</q>
<q>A few feet beyond the circular pool at the end of the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi> just beyond the garden's first principal cross axis, which is emphasized by a pair of previously invisible long rectangular pools, there is a slight shift in the eleva-<lb/>
tion. Descending, the visitor continues along the central promenade. Here one walks along a barely perceptible incline past flower-filled urns that today mark what was once the All&#x00E9;e d'Eau, so named for the evenly spaced low jets of water bordering it. The mild slope of this part of the garden allowed the runoff from the aqueous balustrade formed by the water jets to flow in two clear streams on either side of the central <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi>. This part of the garden terminates in a large square pool.</q>
<q>Beyond the pool, and now suddenly visible, is one of the most impressive sur-<lb/>
prises in the entire garden. The elaborate architectural grotto, which from a dis-<lb/>
tance appears to rise from the far end of the square pool, does not in reality do so. Here, the ground abruptly drops, reveal-<lb/>
ing a huge chasm. This chasm contains the garden's second major cross axis in the form of a wide canal. As unexpected as this sight is, it is only half of the sur-<lb/>
prise, for at the bottom of the stairs to the canal, the entire supporting wall of the terrace above becomes a giant water feature, the <name type="pname">Grandes Cascades</name> (fig. 5.5), a mighty wall of water, commensurate in effect with the scale of the canal beside it and a dramatic counterpoint to the grotto opposite. Now dry, it must be it imagined with the roar and gurgle of water spouting from grotesque masks into cupped bowls and upturned shells.</q>
<q>To approach the grotto one must walk to the far end of the canal and back along the opposite bank. Its architecture of rusticated stone forms a massive sup-<lb/>
port for the terrace above. Beneath the flanking pair of broad stairs that rise to meet this terrace repose giant classical river gods, one symbolizing the Tiber, the other the local Anqueil, the river feeding the canal (fig. 5.6). The grotto steps con-<lb/>
tain a carved lion and squirrel. The agile high-vaulting squirrel was <name type="pname">Fouquet</name>'s emblem, and the lion symbolized his pro-<lb/>
tector, the king. Herms carved in bold relief separate the grotto into seven niches containing artificial rockwork over which water was made to flow into a large rectangular basin. The balustrade of the terrace above the grotto was origi-<lb/>
nally decorated with sculptures. Behind it a jet of water known as the Gerbe, was, according to contemporary accounts, as thick as a man's body and rose a lofty five meters (16&#x2032;5&#x2033;) into the air.</q>
<q>The Gerbe, when operable, must have appeared as a shimmering base for the gilded <name type="pname">Hercules</name>. Modeled on the Far-<lb/>
nese <name type="pname">Hercules</name>, the scale of this colossus is not apparent from the terrace of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>. When apprehended, it makes one aware of the great distance&#x2014;half a mile (800 meters)&#x2014;one has traveled in a straight line from the spot where it first appeared in view.</q>

clarity, a design in which one may grasp the whole composition and from its organizing axes infer the principal spaces, a design in which there is a deft inter-<lb/>
locking of parts and a logical progression from one to another. It also contains much more than meets the eye when the eye enjoys its first satisfying survey of the harmoniously proportioned whole. And even that whole is not revealed at first glance, but rather through a process of unexpected discovery.<ref target="#CH5-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>It is by the laws of geometry, perspective, and optics that Vaux achieves, within the framework of logic, a number of masterly surprises, an accom-<lb/>
plishment belonging not only to <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, but also to the architect <name type="pname">Louis Le Vau</name> and the painter <name type="pname">Charles Le Brun</name> with whom he worked in close collabora-<lb/>
tion. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had in all probability read the <hi rend="italic">Trait&#x00E9; de la section perspective</hi> (1636) by the mathematician and engineer-architect <name type="pname">Girard Desargues</name> (<date when="1591">1591</date>&#x2013;<date when="1661">1661</date>), who attempted to modify Cartesian theory with the notion of a properly geometric infinity. The subtle alterations of grade and multiplicity of perspectives at Vaux dramatize and dignify the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and carry the eye along an axial progression to carefully estab-<lb/>
lished focal points within the garden, as well as to the remote horizon beyond. These effects are the result of precise mathematical calculation. The application of this mathematical knowledge allowed <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> to conceal certain elements of the garden until the vis-<lb/>
itor, progressing through its sequenced spaces, finds them revealed as if by some sort of legerdemain (figs. 5.3&#x2013;5.7). In this orchestration of garden experience, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> exhibits his kinship with the Renaissance designers responsible for hide-and-reveal tactics found at the <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>As is well known in the annals of garden history, <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> a party to celebrate his achievement on <date when="1661-08-17">August 17, 1661</date>. To it he invited the entire court and the young king. Not only had <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> naively deluded himself with regard to the effect that so much ostentation and fashionable display would have upon his master <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> but, ever confident of his abil-<lb/>
ity to charm and flatter his way into power, he had been foolhardy in offering financial advice and credit to the king's mistress, <name type="pname">Louise de La Valli&#x00E8;re</name>, offend-<lb/>
ing her and enraging the king. In addition, he had as an enemy <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste Colbert</name>, who, eager to suc-<lb/>
ceed him, was able to persuade the dying <name type="pname">Cardinal Mazarin</name> to denounce Fouque<name type="pname">t</name>. Whether or not <name type="pname">Fou-<lb/>
quet</name> actually did use public funds to build Vaux, its magnificence and size certainly suggest that this might have been the case.</p>
<p>The party itself lives on in history, not only because of its ironic, if predictable, outcome, but because it expanded the scale of garden festivities, just as Vaux had expanded the scale of the garden itself, to unprecedented dimensions. First, there was a royal tour through the garden with its dancing waters and allusive sculptural program developed perhaps by the fabler La Fontaine.<ref target="#CH5-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref> Then a lavish banquet was held indoors, followed by a comedy and fireworks. The guests returned outside after the banquet to watch <hi rend="italic">Les F&#x00E2;cheux</hi>, written for the occasion by the young Moli&#x00E8;re, who was one of the actors. This was per-<lb/>
formed in front of the <hi rend="italic">Grille d'eau</hi>, a beautiful tiered fountain at one end of the first cross axis. Moli&#x00E8;re begged the king to help him by commanding the gar-<lb/>
den itself to cooperate in producing the spectacle. Thereupon, statues appeared to come to life, trees to move, and rocks to open.<ref target="#CH5-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> When night fell, the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> was lit by hundreds of lanterns placed upon the cornices; the grotto, too, was illuminated. Elabo-<lb/>
rate fireworks rained down from above, some in the form of <hi rend="italic">fleurs de lys</hi>. A mock whale swam the length of the canal discharging more fireworks. Then, as the king prepared to depart, rockets shot from the dome of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>, setting the whole sky ablaze.</p>
<p>On <date when="--09-05">September 5</date>, <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> was arrested on charges of high treason and embezzlement. Although judged innocent on counts that might have warranted the death penalty, <name type="pname">Fouquet</name> was imprisoned for life. <name type="pname">Louis</name>, having immediately appropriated much of the sculpture and new plantings he had seen at Vaux-le-<lb/>
Vicomte, as well as the services of its creators, began redesigning both the gardens of Fontainebleau and those his father had laid out at Versailles.<ref target="#CH5-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Shortly after <name type="pname">Fouquet</name>'s arrest, the three principal designers of <name type="pname">Vaux-le-Vicomte&#x2014;Le Vau</name>, <name type="pname">Le Brun</name>, and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>&#x2014;were hard at work transforming <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name>'s old hunting lodge at Versailles into a place for entertainment with a suitably grand suite of apart-<lb/>
ments for the young king and queen. Le Vau was in charge of remodeling the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> without altering its basic lines; he was also asked to create an orangery. <name type="pname">Le Brun</name> was made responsible for the decoration of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>. To <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> fell the task of developing the plan that would enlarge the gardens to a monu-<lb/>
mental scale, defying both the site's marshy and highly irregular terrain and <name type="pname">Colbert</name>'s assertion that Versailles was but meanly proportioned as a symbol of monar-<lb/>
chical magnificence.<ref target="#CH5-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>As Superintendent of the King's Buildings, <name type="pname">Col-<lb/>
bert</name> oversaw the financing and coordination of the entire construction process, a task in which he was assisted by <name type="pname">Charles Perrault</name> (<date when="1628">1628</date>&#x2013;<date when="1703">1703</date>), First Clerk and later Comptroller of Buildings. <name type="pname">Perrault</name>, whose more enduring fame rests upon a much-loved collec-<lb/>
tion of fairy tales, was probably responsible for the development and construction in the 1660s and 1670s
<pb n="173"/>
<pb n="173" type="orig"/>
of the heliocentric iconography that celebrated the glory of the Sun King and the sun's&#x2014;and there-<lb/>
fore <name type="pname">Louis</name>'s&#x2014;mythological representative, Apollo, throughout the gardens of Versailles (fig. 5.8).</p>
<p>As the iconography of the Sun King became elaborated in several garden compositions, Versailles more and more became the center of court life. After 1678, when <name type="pname">Jules Hardouin-Mansart</name> (<date when="1645">1645</date>&#x2013;<date when="1708">1708</date>), the grandnephew of <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois Mansart</name>, had succeeded Le Vau as official architect to the king, <name type="pname">Louis</name> decided to make his favorite <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> the seat of government. Throughout the early building campaigns at Ver-<lb/>
sailles, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> guided the design of the gardens. In creating in the central <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> the smooth greensward of the <hi rend="italic">tapis vert</hi> and its flanking <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> of geometrically arranged trees, in laying out the <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> beside <name type="pname">Hardouin-Mansart</name>'s 1683 Orangerie, and in building the gardens of the Trianon and the long canal that extended the principal axis to the distant reach of the garden, he worked steadily with professional collab-<lb/>
orators, workmen, and gardeners.</p>
<p>But because Versailles was not conceived as a single unified scheme, as was Vaux-le-Vicomte, it does not have the coherence of its predecessor. Its size is gargantuan, a mighty sprawl over hundreds of acres. And yet <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> maintained a rigorous logic in its design; its central axis and several transverse axes pro-<lb/>
vide a strong framework around which various fea-<lb/>
tures were arranged and rearranged over the years. Within this framework, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his collabora-<lb/>
tors contributed much pleasing incident in the form of fountains, pools, treillage, sculpture, and crisply geometric topiary. It was <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s genius to substi-<lb/>
tute for the ordered intricacy of the older French Renaissance gardens a new clarity, simplicity, auster-<lb/>
ity, and refinement, creating a style of great architec-<lb/>
tonic strength. He drove his axes into the indefinite distance, erasing all visible garden boundaries, creat-<lb/>
ing the paradigm of a world-embracing landscape. In so doing, he also laid down the premises for a new urban order.</p>

</figure>
<p>It is a style in which monumentality is achieved not so much by architectural means as through spa-<lb/>
tial ones. Because of its role as a model for future gar-<lb/>
den and urban design, the plan for Versailles as it existed shortly before the king's death is worth study-<lb/>
ing in regard to its organization of space (figs. 5.9, 5.10). By the application of Cartesian mathematics, landscape is geometricized on a grand scale. Space is projected by axes and defined by cross axes. Radiais converge as a <hi rend="italic">patte d'oie</hi>, or goose foot, upon the palace; these are tree-lined boulevards, the principal avenues of the town of Versailles&#x2014;a planned com-<lb/>
munity of red brick and stone buildings of regulated height, which was laid out as a grid with public squares at certain intersections.</p>

<p>The gardens are elaborated within an overall structure and subdivisions that are inventively geo-<lb/>
metric, and the entire composition, which necessar-<lb/>
ily had to take its point of departure from <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name>'s Versailles, is a remarkable demonstration of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s genius for producing a sense of rational order under awkward conditions. The palace sits athwart the main axis. The first cross axis of the garden bisects <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi>, embroidery-like designs in box-<lb/>
wood and colored gravel. Here, where it is seen from the palace windows at close range, the design is intri-<lb/>
cate and the scale compact. Several successive cross axes and axes paralleling the principal one create a grid within the old stand of forest trees. These are subdivided by paths forming geometric designs, each with a central feature, usually a fountain basin with sculpture. For instance, along the axis of the Parterre du Nord near the palace, the All&#x00E9;e d'Eau&#x2014;twin rows of fountains supported by cherubs&#x2014;leads to the cir-<lb/>
cular Bassin du Dragon.<ref target="#CH5-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The principal axis, which would be vapid if simply projected the length of the garden as an <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> of uniform grade, width, and surface material, is enlivened by changes of level and dimension; alter-<lb/>
nations between gravel, grass, and water; and the addition of several important sculptural features cel-<lb/>
ebrating the Sun King. The first of these, which is reached by a broad flight of stairs descending from a horseshoe-shaped terrace located just beyond the sec-<lb/>
ond cross axis of the garden, is the 1670 masterpiece of <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste Tuby</name> (<date when="1630">1630</date>&#x2013;<date when="1700">1700</date>), the Fountain of Latona, mother of Apollo. The sculptural grouping depicts Latona and her two children, <name type="pname">Apollo</name> and <name type="pname">Diana</name>, surrounded by the wicked Lycian peasants who had refused them water and who, as victims of divine retribution, are in the process of being metamor-<lb/>
phosed into frogs (fig. 5.11).<ref target="#CH5-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> This allegorical com-<lb/>
position based on a story from <name type="pname">Ovid</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis</hi> refers to the Fronde, the civil war in which a rebellious faction representing the parliament of <name type="place">Paris</name> opposed the crown during the minority of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, a threat a to royal power the king never forgot or forgave. Here the anti-authoritarian <hi rend="italic">frondeurs</hi> are symbolized by the discomfited former peasants, now frogs.</p>
<p>Beyond the two mirror-image <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> adjacent to this fountain, the axis turns from gravel into grass, with side <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> flanked by <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi>. This strip of lawn, or <hi rend="italic">tapis vert</hi>, is terminated by another major sculptural feature punctuating the axis: the Basin of Apollo with Tuby's sculpture of the god rising as the morning sun from the water in a chariot drawn by splendid horses, his appearance heralded by horn-blowing tritons (see fig. 5.8). Cast of lead and then gilded, this group remains one of the principal sights of Versailles as the morning sun illuminates its frontal, east-facing side or the setting sun washes it from the rear. On the far side of the Basin of Apollo, the axis becomes a canal that appears to stretch in a watery line to the horizon, now marked by two giant poplars. It has an impor-<lb/>
tant cross axis, giving it a cruciform shape. The

The engravings depict the entertainments that both glorified the king and demonstrated his power. The first celebrated his alliance with his mistress, <name type="pname">Louise de La Valli&#x00E8;re</name>, during five days at the beginning of <date when="1664-05">May 1664</date>, The marriage of nature and stagecraft is apparent in several tableaux of various events and is discernible even in a banqueting scene, where torchbearers form a line of "footlights" in front of the guests, while, behind them, costumed waiters hold aloft trays of mounded delicacies as they move with balletic grace and precision in front of the security guards that hold back the gathered spectators. In a similar fashion, a proscenium arch was erected to frame a garden perspective that served as the living backdrop for both a ballet and a play, which was given on the second day of the <hi rend="italic">f&#x00EA;te</hi>.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>An octagonal basin forms the head of the canal and the point of departure for a major cross axis and two pairs of diagonal axes. These diagonal axes set up a new series of alignments as they and other minor axes crisscrossing them project the garden's space out-<lb/>
ward in a dynamic fashion. Beyond the canal, a <hi rend="italic">rond-<lb/>
point</hi> creates a starburst of axes, which is echoed elsewhere in the garden by other circles with axes radi-<lb/>
ating out from them. It is as if <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> were trying to demonstrate in a terrestrial manner <name type="pname">Descartes</name>'s proposition of <hi rend="italic">extensio</hi>, the indefinite extension of cos-<lb/>
mic space. Practically, the plan of Versailles furnished the inspiration for thousands of landscape creations, serving as the wellspring for gardens and city plans throughout <name type="place">Europe</name> and, later, all across the globe.</p>
<p>Over the years, <name type="pname">Louis</name> directed <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> to revise several parts of the gardens. He caused the fountains and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> containing sculpture illuminating the Apollonian theme to become the tourist attraction they have remained ever since. Because <name type="pname">Louis</name>'s life was lived almost entirely in public amid the busy swarm of his ever-present court, there was an almost endless stream of visitors from home and abroad to admire the gardens. <name type="pname">Madeleine de Scud&#x00E9;ry</name>, a contemporary to whom we owe a lively account of the unforgettable but unfortunate festivity at Vaux-le-Vicomte, in 1669 produced <hi rend="italic">La Promenade de Versailles</hi>, an itinerary for vis-<lb/>
itors. In 1674, the artist and historiographer <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; F&#x00E9;li-<lb/>
bien</name> published his guidebook entitled <hi rend="italic">Description sommaire du chasteau de Versailles</hi>. The king often con-<lb/>
ducted tours and was the author of a periodically revised guide, first issued in 1689, which peremptorily advised one where to stand and what to notice.</p>
<p>The engravings of <name type="pname">Isra&#x00EB;l Silvestre</name>, <name type="pname">Adam P&#x00E9;relle</name>, and <name type="pname">Antoine Le Pautre</name> are all animated by human fig-<lb/>
ures in aristocratic dress, lending a measure of scale to buildings, <hi rend="italic">palissades</hi>, and fountain jets and bringing the gardens to life with many telling social details. The gardens at Versailles were, moreover, not only intended as a stage for the pageantry of aristocracy; <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his collaborators created elaborate tem-<lb/>
porary stages and areas suitable as outdoor theaters for the actual dramas and other spectacles that soon became an indispensable part of court life (fig. 5.12). The composer Lully collaborated with <name type="pname">Moli&#x00E8;re</name> on several of the spectacles that were staged there. <hi rend="italic">Palis-<lb/>

<p>In 1665, work was begun on the Grotto of Thetis, which had a reservoir on its roof to supply water for the gardens' numerous fountains (fig. 5.13). One of the last and most opulent of such architec-<lb/>
tural grottoes to be built, it stood on the upper ter-<lb/>
race between the north side of the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and the Parterre du Nord. <name type="pname">Charles Perrault</name> developed the con-<lb/>
cept for the grotto, relying on <name type="pname">Ovid</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> for the story of Apollo driving his fiery steeds across the sky all day and then repairing at nightfall to the underwater palace of the sea goddess Thetis. Its three niches contained sculptural groups depicting the repose of Apollo, who is being bathed by the nymphs of Thetis, and the grooming of the horses of the Sun by Tritons. The interior walls were richly ornamented with shell mosaic, and the exterior of the grotto was equally decorative. <name type="pname">Perrault</name> credited his brother <name type="pname">Claude</name>, a physidan-architect, with designing the gilded grilles forming a sunburst pattern in its three wrought-<lb/>
iron arched gates. When these gates were opened, the richly decorated facade and well-lit interior became the backdrop for theatrical productions, including that of Moli&#x00E8;re's <hi rend="italic">Le Malade imaginaire</hi> in 1674. The descent of Apollo and his horses into the sea, which was expressed in the grotto's exterior frieze by <name type="pname">G&#x00E9;rard van Opstal</name>, was symbolically paired with Tuby's horses rising with the god in the Basin of Apollo.</p>
<p>The extensive building period to which the con-<lb/>
struction of the Grotto of Thetis, the decoration of the Basin of Apollo, and the installation of the Latona Fountain belong coincided with the king's taking the witty and accomplished Ath&#x00E9;na&#x00EF;s Rochechouart de Mortemart, Marquise de Montespan, for his new mis-<lb/>
tress in 1668.<ref target="#CH5-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref> Her establishment was followed by the construction of Le Vau's Enveloppe, or the Ch&#x00E2;teau Neuf, as it was also called. Because its broad fa&#x00E7;ade destroyed the floral <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi>, or queen's garden, on the south side of the old <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi>, the king, who loved flowers, sought another part of Versailles where he could enjoy the fragrance and colorful display of exotic specimens in carefully arranged beds. He also wished to have a pleasant retreat where he could retire with Madame de Montespan and a few favorites, away from the public glare of the large, well-<lb/>
populated Ch&#x00E2;teau Neuf.</p>
<p>It was for these reasons that in 1671, on the site of the former village of Trianon, the Trianon de Porcelaine, so named for the Delft ceramic tiles that decorated its roof, was built. Throughout the long period in which the Trianon de Porcelaine was in use, Madame de Montespan remained the favorite; its demolition in 1687, when <name type="pname">Hardouin-Mansart</name>'s Grand Trianon (the Trianon de Marbe) was built, marked her replacement by Fran&#x00E7;oise d'Aubign&#x00E9;, Madame de Maintenon. <name type="pname">Michel Le Bouteux</name>, the husband of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s niece, was in charge of the nurseries that sup-<lb/>
ported the lavish floriculture of this section of Ver-<lb/>
sailles. He was also responsible for ordering and planting many exotic flowers, such as tuberoses, which gardeners installed at every season of the year in floral <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>. The ability to procure these exceed-<lb/>
ingly rare treasures symbolized absolute monarchy as much as did <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s commanding axes and Ver-<lb/>
sailles's heliocentric iconography celebrating <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s role as Sun King.</p>
<p>During this period, by which time the main architectonics of Versailles were established, increas-<lb/>
ing attention was paid to the development of the <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> (fig. 5.14). <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> created several of these green theaters within the Petit Parc, including Le Marais, a fanciful rectangular pond surrounded by metallic reeds and containing a tree, also of metal, in the <hi rend="italic">bosquet</hi> just beneath the terrace sustaining the Parterre de Nord; L'&#x00C9;toile, a starlike maze of tree-<lb/>
lined paths converging upon a central Montagne d'Eau formed of <hi rend="italic">rocaille</hi> (rustic rockwork); and the Labyrinthe located to the west of the Orangerie on the south side of the Petit Parc where various turn-<lb/>
ings and cul-de-sacs were punctuated by fountains with sculptures depicting animals from the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of Aesop. The ground to the west of the Labyrinthe was low-lying and spongy. Here, in <date when="1671">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1674">74</date>, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> used two units of his <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi>-gridded plan to form a large water feature consisting of a semicircular basin known as the Miroir and a larger basin containing the Isle Royale. He emphasized the garden's dominant theme by making the Isle Royale circular like the Sun and projecting sixteen raylike <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> from the edges of the water basin in which it sat.

<p>The 1680s, which opened with <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s return from <name type="place">Italy</name> (where he had traveled only to learn that the most advanced concepts in landscape design were now originating in <name type="place">France</name>), also constituted the period in which <name type="pname">Jules Hardouin-Mansart</name> was busy directing the last major building phase of Versailles. <name type="pname">Louis</name>, at the height of his power and passion for building, now sought a new retreat, one even more private than the Trianon. At <name type="pname">Marly</name>, overlooking the Seine and Saint-Germain in the distance, he commissioned <name type="pname">Hardouin-Mansart</name> to design a new small <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> with separate guest pavilions in order to ensure the king's privacy (fig. 5.15). By 1683, he was able to host enter-<lb/>
tainments in the unfinished gardens. Because <name type="pname">Marly</name>, unlike Versailles, enjoyed a hillside location, the king was eager to have <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> design for it a cascade such as the ones he had seen on his recent trip to <name type="place">Italy</name>. However, it was not until <date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1699">99</date>, just before <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s death, that the project of building La Rivi&#x00E8;re on the slope behind the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> was accomplished.</p>
<p>Today all but a few of the marble sculptures that once decorated <name type="pname">Marly</name>, together with an abundance of bronze and marble vases and statues, are displayed at the Louvre. The <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> and guest pavilions have vanished. Only a broad stripe of green turf marks the course of the king's cascade. This piece of grass sym-<lb/>
bolizes the chief problem that beset not only <name type="pname">Marly</name>, but also Versailles and the Trianon: an insufficiency of water for the more than 1,400 dazzling waterworks these gardens contained. The grotto, <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> of the Petit Parc at Versailles and the gardens of the Trianon were in the time of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> enlivened with water cascading, purling, leaping, or lying quietly in basins. Water served as one of the principal performers in the pageantry of these land-<lb/>
scapes, mirroring their architecture of stone and ver-<lb/>
dure and animating perspectives. There was, in fact, an insatiable demand to furnish the ever-multiplying fountains, which constantly taxed the ingenuity of the <hi rend="italic">fontainiers</hi>, plumbers, and engineers who worked to increase and maintain water supply and pressure.</p>

<p>To operate the fountains at Versailles required a corps of highly disciplined workers under a master-<lb/>

neers undertook many elaborate and costly schemes to increase the water supply. Between 1682 and 1688, they built a vast contraption known as the Machine de Marly. It was equipped with fourteen huge wheels that powered pumps conveying water from the Seine uphill to two reservoirs, whence it was distributed to the gardens of Marly, Versailles, and the Trianon, But even then the fountains could not all flow simultane-<lb/>
ously. After 1684, the military engineer <name type="pname">S&#x00E9;bastien Le Prestre de Vauban</name> directed an ambitious scheme to divert the waters of the Eure River 28 miles (70 kilo-<lb/>
meters) distant; as many as 30,000 soldiers were set to work, and huge sums of money were spent. In the face of the War of the League of Augsburg, <name type="pname">Louis</name> abandoned the project.</p>

<p>The treatment of the royal gardens of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> as vast public works projects employing both military and civilian workers in the movement of earth on a scale hitherto unknown&#x2014;leveling view-<lb/>
obstructing hills, excavating low-lying marshes to form canals, and filling in depressions to create enor-<lb/>
mous level terraces&#x2014;is evident even in the Potager du Roi, the vegetable garden at Versailles. Here, between 1677 and 1683, <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste de la Quintinye</name> (<date when="1626">1626</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688">1688</date>), the king's head gardener for fruits and vegetables, oversaw the creation of a 20-acre walled enclosure on low-lying lands to the southeast of the palace with dredged spoil from the Pi&#x00E8;ce d'Eau des Suisses and topsoil from the Satory Hills. A statue of this highly respected man today presides over the extensive <hi rend="italic">potager</hi> with its planting beds carefully delin-<lb/>
eated by many varieties of espaliered fruit trees.</p>
<p>It was <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s genius to consolidate the work of such predecessors as <name type="pname">Boyceau</name> and <name type="pname">Lemercier</name> into a style of great architectonic strength, carrying their achievements to a logical conclusion and substituting for the ordered intricacy of the older Renaissance gar-<lb/>
dens a new clarity, simplicity, austerity, and refine-<lb/>
ment. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s legacy lies in his treatment of space as an abstract, geometrical entity, his understanding of spatial optics, and his expansion of landscape design to a monumental scale. This far-reaching legacy is expressed not only at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles, but also in the gardens <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> designed at other royal and noble residences near <name type="place">Paris</name>. He reorganized Fontainebleau according to a grandly simple plan. At Saint-Germain-en-Laye he laid out a new rectangular garden, which replaced that of Henri IV, and at Saint-Cloud, he employed the hilly terrain to good effect, creating a broad <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> that dropped and then ascended to a high point, affording a fine view of <name type="place">Paris</name> in the distance. He gave expression to the power and the optimism of the age at <name type="pname">Colbert</name>'s <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> of Sceaux in the construction of a spectacular cascade and the digging of a 3,465-foot- (1056-meter-) long canal that today, with its reflected border of tall swaying poplars, serves as a canyonlike cloud cham-<lb/>
ber (fig. 5.16). In another major feat of design and hydraulic engineering, he created the Grand Canal, a great circular basin, and magnificent oval pools at Chantilly between 1671 and 1681 (fig. 5.17).</p>
<p>In 1700, shortly before <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s death, <name type="pname">Louis</name> and his gardener toured the gardens of Versailles for the last time. Because of his advanced years, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> was invited to ride in a chair wheeled by a footman. With characteristic modesty and frank delight, <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> was heard to exclaim: "Alas! my poor father, had he been alive to see this poor gardener, his own son, riding in a chair beside the greatest king on earth, his happiness would have been complete."<ref target="#CH5-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Between <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s death in 1700 and his own in 1715, <name type="pname">Louis</name> faced family tragedy and became increasingly stoical as he anticipated his own approaching end amid disastrous military defeats and the declining economic power of <name type="place">France</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> The vanished glory of his age was soon after captured by eighteenth-century painters such as <name type="pname">Jean-Honor&#x00E9; Fragonard</name> in scenes of figures disporting themselves in the now-derelict great gardens of the epoch of the Sun King, which they saw in their abandonment as sweetly picturesque (see fig. 7.41). A similar air of melancholy vacancy appears in the photographs Eug&#x00E8;ne Atget made of some of Le N&#x00F4;tr&#x00E9;'s gardens at the beginning of the twentieth century.<ref target="#CH5-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The reaction to a static and authoritarian order had already begun to set in as new ideas and voices challenged the spirit of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi>. But <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s influence remained strong. His practice was inherited and his style continued by his nephew <name type="pname">Claude Desgots</name> (d. 1732). In <name type="pname">Antoine-Joseph Dezal-<lb/>
lier d'Argenville</name> (<date when="1680">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765">1765</date>) <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> found an author who codified his design method in the treatise that he had never found time to write. <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s book became a manual for designers commissioned by the courts of <name type="place">Europe</name> to create gardens in the French classical style. As combined with the lingering influence of the Italian garden, it evolved through the first two-thirds of the eighteenth century into an inter-<lb/>
national garden style, which was inflected according
<pb n="179"/>
<pb n="179" type="orig"/>
to local conditions and taste. It is a style that is still influential, as can be seen in some of the gardens of the American landscape architects <name type="pname">Dan Kiley</name> and <name type="pname">Peter Walker</name>, for example. It can also be observed in <name type="place">France</name> itself, where the recently built Parc Citro&#x00EB;n in <name type="place">Paris</name> shows how its enduring principles can be trans-<lb/>
lated into a contemporary idiom.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Garden as Theater: Italian Baroque and Rococo Gardens</hi></head>
<p>The austere harmonies of French classicism never penetrated very deeply into the Italian design ethos. The seventeenth-century Italian style, like that of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, was an integrative one in which individual parts were organized into a unified composition. But instead of achieving compositional unity with author-<lb/>
itarian axes flung down along lines apparently extend-<lb/>
ing into infinity, the builders of Italian gardens&#x2014;often encouraged by topography&#x2014;wove dramatic hang-<lb/>
ing terraces and ornamental flights of stairs into hillsides to produce theatrical arrangements of land-<lb/>
scape. The dramatic potential of moving water con-<lb/>
tinued to be exploited in the construction of elaborate sculptural cascades like the one at Villa Lante (see fig. 4.25). Unlike French garden designers, whose strug-<lb/>
gles to furnish water to their fountains, pools, and cas-<lb/>
cades were herculean and often intensely frustrating as well as wasteful both of capital and human lives, Italian architects were more fortunate in their ability to convey water to their sites in copious quantities, albeit also at the expense of much backbreaking labor and often intense politics. Their gardens were vehi-<lb/>
cles for princely pomp and display, and the glorifica-<lb/>
tion of their patrons became ever more explicit as decorative coats of arms and other family emblems were prominently featured instead of being merely encoded symbolically into the landscape.<ref target="#CH5-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Not only were dramatic astonishment and the-<lb/>
atrical perspective effectively used in the layout of Italian Baroque gardens, but also many of the gar-<lb/>
dens of this period contained actual outdoor theaters with a grassy stage, hedges for wings, and some-<lb/>
times, peeping forth from the greenery, terra-cotta figures representing stock characters of the <hi rend="italic">comme-<lb/>
dia dell'arte</hi> tradition popularized by troupes of Ital-<lb/>
ian actors since the second half of the sixteenth century (fig. 5.18). Pastoral drama was echoed in the sculptural Satyrs and Pans that populated garden woods or the edges of garden walks, as well as in the taste for genre figures of peasants engaged in a vari-<lb/>
ety of tasks.</p>
<p>Italian designers probably found the Cartesian paradigm of non-place-specific axial planning less con-<lb/>
genial than one that recognized place as particular and bounded. This may be explained by the fact that the topography throughout much of <name type="place">Italy</name> is hilly, thereby promoting greater opportunity visually for spatial enclosure than for spatial extension. In
<pb n="180"/>
<pb n="180" type="orig"/>
addition, Italian designers were more likely to retain, however unconsciously, the concept of <hi rend="italic">topos</hi>&#x2014;the philosophical notion of emplacement derived from <name type="pname">Aristotle</name>&#x2014;because it was already abundantly mani-<lb/>
fested in the antique classical landscape tradition to which they were heirs. Although much larger than their Italian Renaissance counterparts, on the whole, Italian gardens in the seventeenth century were more intimately scaled than those of contemporary <name type="place">France</name>, and though axes might dissolve into nature, they did not appear to extend into the indefinite distance as if to meet the line of the horizon. In conservative Tus-<lb/>
cany, this observation holds true to an even greater degree. A predilection for comparatively simple famil-<lb/>
ial pastimes resulted in relatively small gardens com-<lb/>
posed of well-proportioned "rooms" of greenery. One French feature, the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi>, did gain popularity. By the end of the seventeenth century it had mostly replaced the geometric compartments of traditional <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>.</p>

<p>By the mid-sixteenth century, nepotism had become thoroughly institutionalized within the Catholic Church, and it was common practice for a pope to appoint a nephew as cardinal to serve in the capacity of trusted assistant during his pontificate. The cardi-<lb/>

<p>The relaxed, ample, architectonic muscularity of this garden sequence epitomizes the Italian Baroque garden style. The architectural robustness and play of light and shade characteristic of the period are particularly evident in the semicircular arcaded water theater facing the ground floor of the villa (fig. 5.19). Its sculptural decor displays the naturalistic character, compositional arrangement into counterbal-<lb/>
anced diagonals, and thrusting movement into space that we associate with Baroque art in general. The iconographic program, however, is still allusively sym-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">The Farnese Gardens at Caprarola and on the Palatine Hill, <name type="place">Rome</name></hi></head>
<p>At Caprarola, near Viterbo, in the first third of the sixteenth century, <name type="pname">Cardinal Alessandro Farnese</name> had commissioned <name type="pname">Antonio da Sangallo</name> the Younger (<date when="1483">1483</date>&#x2013;<date when="1546">1546</date>) to build a fortified palace, a huge pen-<lb/>
tagonal building with bastions. In 1556, with fear of renewed Spanish invasion diminishing, the cardinal commissioned the architect <name type="pname">Vignola</name> to transform his fortress into a summer villa. It has been saved for dis-<lb/>
cussion here because the additions, which were made around 1620 by <name type="pname">Girolamo Rainaldi</name> (<date when="1570">1570</date>&#x2013;<date when="1655">1655</date>), illus-<lb/>
trate the evolution of Italian garden design from a metaphorical fusion of art and nature within the con-<lb/>
text of a carefully conceived humanistic iconography into a more purely aesthetic architectural statement.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Caprarola</name>'s significance in the history of land-<lb/>
scape design lies in the creation of the Barchetto, a secluded retreat with a <hi rend="italic">casino</hi> and herm-guarded <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi> approached by a quarter-mile-long path leading through the woods from the summer garden next to the palace (figs. 5.22&#x2013;5.25). It was built five years after <name type="pname">Vignola</name>'s death in 1573, probably according to the design of <name type="pname">Giacomo del Duca</name>. Its design as a series of descending terraces built into a hillside, its fountain flanked by reclining river gods, and its curvilinear <hi rend="italic">catena d'acqua</hi>, or water cascade, imitate <name type="pname">Vignola</name>'s achievement at Bagnaia.</p>
<p>The Barchetto at Caprarola, created in two epochs of garden building&#x2014;with its original form echoing <name type="pname">Vignola</name>'s design at the Villa Lante and its later additions by Rainaldi&#x2014;provides a unique and

ing. It is pleasantly surprising to encounter the first of a series of terraces carved into this woodland setting. Here one finds a circular fountain basin above which rises a beautiful water chain mod-<lb/>
eled on that at the Villa Lante (fig. 5.23; <hi rend="bold">A</hi>). This is composed of pairs of wrig-<lb/>
gling dolphins, and the playful effect of the water's undulations as it slips over the scalloped basins between the dol-<lb/>
phins is similar to the shimmering flow between the curvilinear borders describ-<lb/>
ing an elongated crayfish of <name type="pname">Cardinal Gambara</name>'s water channel. Here the gen-<lb/>
tle cascade is bordered by ramps leading up to a piazza, where river gods recline on either side of a huge vase-shaped fountain <hi rend="bold">B</hi>. From this, jets of water pat-<lb/>
terned to form the Farnese lily spill water into a basin below (fig. 5.25). Curving ramps lead up to the <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi> <hi rend="bold">C</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">casino</hi> <hi rend="bold">D</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">casino</hi> has a double loggia at its base and a single loggia above where the <hi rend="italic">piano nobile</hi> opens onto an upper terrace. These are the main components of the sixteenth-<lb/>
century Barchetto.</q>
<q>The seventeenth-century additions by <name type="pname">Rainaldi</name> exploit the architectural char-<lb/>
acter and dramatic potential of the origi-<lb/>
nal scheme. Large torsos of Prudence and Silence, as these figures are known, were mounted on grand carved double pedestals in front of the sixteenth-century walls outlining the sides of the first ter-<lb/>
race, adding theatrical intensity and an augmented air of mystery to the space. Boldly scaled rusticated pavilions set between the outer sloping walls on either side of the circular pool and the inner walls, which also slope upward as they define the edges of the twin ramps beside the water chain, give additional architec-<lb/>
tonic power to the composition. At the piazza of the Vase Fountain, along the curving wall embracing the stairs that lead to the terrace above, forcefully artic-<lb/>
ulated rusticated pilasters framing niches of rough stonework have replaced the sixteenth-century surface, which was probably decorated with stucco reliefs. Also part of the seventeenth-century revi-<lb/>
sion are copies of large antique heads set into the niches and upon the scrolling brackets that ornament the curving walls of rough, banded stonework.</q>
<q>Ascending the stairs one enters the <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi>. Here the seventeenth-<lb/>
century planners gave a more powerful spatial definition to the sixteenth-century garden by substituting large herms with expressive faces and gestures for the globe finials that originally decorated the perimeter parapet (fig. 5.24). The vases on their heads give a uniform "cornice line" to the green room of box compart-<lb/>
ments they preside over, thereby increas-<lb/>
ing the architectural character of the space. In contrast to <name type="pname">Vignola</name>'s summer and winter gardens adjacent to the palace below, where grottoes, fountains, and classical figures furnished a specific symbolism, there is no special icono-<lb/>
graphie message to decode here; the herms, believed to be the work of <name type="pname">Pietro Bernini</name> (<date when="1562">1562</date>&#x2013;<date when="1629">1629</date>), are satyric gods gathered in an ordered clearing within the wild woodland, allusive only of the mysterious life forces present in an enchanted spot.</q>

dens.<ref target="#CH5-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> The Farnese pope, Paul III (papacy <date when="1534">1534</date>&#x2013;<date when="1549">1549</date>), was avidly interested in botany an enthu-<lb/>
siasm that was continued by his grandson, <name type="pname">Cardinal Alessandro Farnese</name>, as well as by the cardinal's nephew and heir, <name type="pname">Cardinal Odoardo Farnese</name>. Indeed, the scientific interest in botany, a development of the Renaissance, was given new impetus in the seven-<lb/>
teenth century, an age of exploration and discovery, when plants from the Americas and <name type="place">Asia</name> were eagerly sought by many wealthy collectors and by botanical gardens, such as those founded at Padua in 1545 and Leiden in 1587. It is not therefore surpris-<lb/>
ing to find in <name type="place">Rome</name> a famous early botanical collec-<lb/>
tion of the wealthy Farnese family, begun in the sixteenth century and continued throughout the seventeenth.</p>
<p>The Farnese Gardens built atop the Palatine in <name type="place">Rome</name> over the ruins of the palaces of the emperors Tiberius and Domitian were created by various members of the great Farnese family including <name type="pname">Pope Paul III</name>, <name type="pname">Cardinal Alessandro</name>,<ref target="#CH5-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref> and <name type="pname">Cardinal Odoardo Farnese</name> (fig. 5.26). They span the same period from the late Renaissance to the end of the seventeenth century as the successive stages of the Farnese gardens at Caprarola and were probably designed by the same architects&#x2014;<name type="pname">Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola</name>, <name type="pname">Giacomo del Duca</name>, and <name type="pname">Girolamo Rainaldi</name>. They constituted a renowned center for plant propagation and exhibition until archaeologists digging the ruins of imperial <name type="place">Rome</name> in the eighteenth century destroyed them.<ref target="#CH5-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Several flights of stairs lead to an upper terrace where the main axis is punctuated by a fern-<lb/>
encrusted water theater set between the bases of twin aviaries and flanked by a pair of staircases lead-<lb/>

tury design amid the archaeological excavations.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Country Retreats of the Roman Aristocracy: Villa Borghese and Villa Pamphili</hi></head>
<p>Two of the great estates within <name type="place">Rome</name> assembled by princes of the Church between the last years of the sixteenth century and the end of the seventeenth&#x2014;Villa Borghese and Villa Pamphili&#x2014;today serve as popular public parks. Two other important gardens, Villa Montalto and Villa Ludovisi, were destroyed in the nineteenth century, the former to accommodate the train terminal and rail yards next to the Baths of Diocletian and the latter to profit speculators in the new housing market that was created when <name type="place">Rome</name> became a national capital following the reunification of <name type="place">Italy</name>.</p>
<p>When <name type="pname">Cardinal Camillo Borghese</name> became <name type="pname">Pope Paul V</name> (papacy <date when="1605">1605</date>&#x2013;<date when="1621">1621</date>), he promptly conferred a cardinalate upon his nephew <name type="pname">Scipione Caffarelli</name>, there-<lb/>
after known as <name type="pname">Cardinal Borghese</name>. The new cardinal and his relatives soon began amassing land for a large suburban estate, or <hi rend="italic">vigna</hi>, on the Pincian Hill just out-<lb/>side the northern walls of the city. Family pride, sport-<lb/>
ing pleasure, and aesthetic delight motivated the design of their villa in the early years of the seventeenth cen-<lb/>
tury. Although suffering today from insufficient main-<lb/>
tenance&#x2014;like many Italian public parks&#x2014;the gardens of the Villa Borghese remain a popular amenity for modern Romans, and its art galleries constitute a museum of international renown. The casino designed by Flaminio Ponzio (<date when="1560">1560</date>&#x2013;<date when="1613">1613</date>), with its extensive decoration completed by the Flemish archi-<lb/>
tect <name type="pname">Jan van Santen</name> (<name type="pname">Giovanni Vasanzio</name>), was con-<lb/>
ceived as a close cousin of the nearby <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> both in plan and in the heavy ornamentation of its exterior walls (stripped of their sculpture by <name type="pname">Napoleon</name>).</p>
<p>When completed, the Borghese Gardens con-<lb/>
sisted of three separate enclosures, or <hi rend="italic">recinti</hi> (fig. 5.28). The first <hi rend="italic">recinto</hi> was a <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> of regular <hi rend="italic">boschetti</hi> (com-<lb/>
partments of trees) planted in the 1620s in front of the villa. This section was accessible to the public. A second <hi rend="italic">recinto</hi>, which was reserved for the private use of the family, lay behind the villa. It was planted with groves of holm oak. The third <hi rend="italic">recinto</hi> consisted of a well-stocked game park on the irregular lands to the north. Between the first and second <hi rend="italic">recinti</hi>, the villa was constructed, with an intimately scaled private gar-<lb/>
den&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi>&#x2014;placed on either side of it. High walls surrounded the entire estate.</p>
<p>The wall that originally screened the two <hi rend="italic">giar-<lb/>
dini segreti</hi> from the transverse avenue running in front of the villa was torn down during the nineteenth-<lb/>
century modernization in the English style. The con-<lb/>
dition of these small gardens today is considerably altered from that of the seventeenth century, when they were filled with espaliered citrus trees, free-<lb/>
standing orange trees, and, in the springtime, masses of exotic bulbs. Gone, too, are the birds that sang in copper-netted cages in the twin aviaries that still stand in the northern garden. Beyond the aviaries, which were probably inspired by those of the Farnese Gar-<lb/>
dens atop the Palatine, is the Meridiana, a sundial.</p>

<p>Aesthetic and sensual pleasures motivated the creation of the Villa Borghese. Art collecting, social entertainment, and hunting were the principal pur-<lb/>
poses it served. Sculpture was used decoratively in its application to the villa facades and throughout the garden. To understand the change that took place in Italian villa design between the sixteenth and seven-<lb/>
teenth centuries, one can compare the siting of the Villa Borghese with that of the nearby <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name>. As at the <name type="pname">Villa Aldobrandini</name>, the <name type="pname">Villa Giulia</name> and its gar-<lb/>
den are powerfully united through axial composition (see fig. 4.12). The Borghese Villa, on the other hand, is not the principal organizing force and focus of axial planning, but simply one element within a broader landscape composition. The landscape itself is treated
<pb n="186"/>
<pb n="186" type="orig"/>
in a less particular, more loosely articulated fashion than those of earlier gardens. In all these ways, the Villa Borghese announces its participation in a new era of Italian landscape design.</p>

<p>The tenets of this later style are further illus-<lb/>
trated in the Villa Pamphili, atop the <name type="place">Janiculum Hill</name> in <name type="place">Rome</name>. In 1640, <name type="pname">Camillo Pamphili</name> increased the size of the <hi rend="italic">vigna</hi> he had inherited from his father at that location by acquiring another one adjacent to it. Then, upon the election of his uncle as <name type="pname">Pope Innocent X</name> in 1644, <name type="pname">Camillo</name> was chosen to fill the cardinal-nephew position. Although in 1647 he was permitted to resign his cardinalate in order to perpetuate the Pamphili family by marrying <name type="pname">Olimpia Aldobrandini</name>, land pur-<lb/>
chases continued until 1673, when, under his son, the <hi rend="italic">vigna</hi> reached its ultimate size of 240 acres.</p>
<p>Begun in 1644, the beautiful <hi rend="italic">casino</hi>, tall, com-<lb/>
pact, and richly decorated with sculpture and frescoes in the manner of the Villa Borghese, was completed by 1648. Like the Villa Borghese, its primary function was as an art gallery and a place for social entertain-<lb/>
ment. There were no bedrooms, as the family resi-<lb/>
dence lay a short distance to the west on the Via Aurelia. Although the plan of the <hi rend="italic">casino</hi> was traversed by two of the several wide axes dividing the grounds into a notably regular composition, the elegant struc-<lb/>
ture was not a focal point in the overall design of the gardens (fig. 5.29).</p>
<p>The low <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">giardini seg-<lb/>
reti</hi> next to the villa show French influence on later Italian garden design (fig. 5.30). The transformation of the original compartmentalized design of these <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> to an embroidered pattern probably did not occur until the eighteenth century, as Italian garden-<lb/>
ers long resisted this style, although it had been pop-<lb/>
ularized elsewhere in the mid-seventeenth century through French pattern book engravings.<ref target="#CH5-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Like the Villa Borghese, the Villa Pamphili illus-<lb/>
trates the grand scale and quasi-public character of the seventeenth-century Roman garden parks where some members of the populace were occasionally permitted entry. In their rich display of architecture and sculpture to ennoble and dramatize landscape, these great Roman villas memorialize the opulent lives of the princes of the Church in an age of proudly ambitious aristocracy.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Tuscan Garden Design: Villa Garzoni and La Gamberaia</hi></head>
<p>In Tuscany, outside the Italian center of international power, the breadth of scale and architectural grandeur found in the Villa Borghese and the Villa Pamphili remained foreign. Although in villas around <name type="place">Florence</name> and Lucca one finds Roman design idioms&#x2014;for instance, hanging hillside terraces with vase-topped balustrades, cascades, and ornamental sculpture&#x2014;these characteristics are manifested in a far less
<pb n="187"/>
<pb n="187" type="orig"/>
extravagant manner. Most of the gardens of Tuscany built in the seventeenth century have an affinity with earlier gardens such as those of the <name type="pname">Villa Medici</name> at <name type="place">Fiesole</name>. Their designs are conservative, usually com-<lb/>
posed as a series of outdoor rooms with views of the surrounding agricultural landscape of olive trees and vineyards. One of these is usually a <hi rend="italic">limonaia</hi>, a walled garden filled with potted lemon trees, which were removed in the winter to an adjacent long, barnlike conservatory (fig. 5.31). But Tuscan gardens show innovative and evolutionary tendencies as well, first those characteristic of a Baroque sensibility, and later those of the graceful Rococo style of the eighteenth century, when many additions or remodelings of old gardens were made.</p>
<p>Where the nineteenth-century fashion for Eng-<lb/>
lish-style gardens did not obliterate the original designs and restoration has been possible, present-day main-<lb/>
tenance costs and a preference for abstraction have caused the planting schemes of these old gardens to be simplified. But in the best-preserved of them, we may still find the exuberant curvilinear movement and ornamentation characteristic of the Baroque style. It is to be seen in the black-and-white pebble-<lb/>
ornamented walls, the pebble mosaic paving, the sculptural hedges, the lavish use of ornamental stat-<lb/>
uary (much of it in terra-cotta), the water theaters, and the intimate green theaters in which <hi rend="italic">commedia del-<lb/>
l'arte</hi> performances were held&#x2014;all of which are char-<lb/>
acteristic of this golden age of Tuscan garden design.</p>
<p>The outlying garden closest in spirit to the Roman Baroque models is that of the Villa Garzoni in Collodi, near Lucca, a composition of hillside ter-<lb/>
races with robust balusters and lighthearted sculp-<lb/>
tural decoration, arabesque floral <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> with heraldic devices in colored pebble mosaic, and a water cascade issuing from a grotto, above which soars a fig-<lb/>
ure of Fame trumpeting her horn (figs. 5.32, 5.33). The villa itself bears a curious relationship to the gar-<lb/>
den because of its origins as a defensive castle strate-<lb/>
gically sited with a ramp leading from the town below.<ref target="#CH5-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref> Purchased by the Garzoni family from the Republic of Lucca in the early years of the seven-<lb/>
teenth century, it was transformed into a villa with gardens on the adjacent slope several decades later. Subsequent improvements, such as the addition of a bathhouse near the apex of the cascade, were made in the eighteenth century under the direction of the Lucchese architect Ottaviano Diodati.</p>

<p>Central niches reinforce the main axis between each set of double stairs. In keeping with the more friv-<lb/>
olous spirit of the later age, these and various side niches are inhabited by a whimsical blend of genre fig-<lb/>
ures and pagan deities. Here and elsewhere, in the company of Apollo, <name type="pname">Diana</name>, Pomona, Ceres, Bacchus, and other familiar mythological garden residents including fauns and herms, one finds sculpted peas-<lb/>
ants engaged in agricultural pursuits. Thus, the grotto with Neptune rising in his horse-drawn chariot from the sea occupies the niche on a middle terrace, while a peasant holding a cask is contained in the terrace below, and a peasant with a <name type="place">turkey</name> stands in the one above. These three niches are heavily framed with rus-<lb/>

several places, continuing the characteristically Baroque curvilinear surface patterning. A terra-cotta band of twelve monkeys playing ball adds piquant charm to the balustrades of the upper terraces (fig. 5.34).</p>
<p>From here one can look down and appreciate the arabesques of box <hi rend="italic">broderie</hi> surrounding twin cir-<lb/>
cular pools, the elaborate floral and stone mosaic <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> with the Garzoni monogram and heraldic devices, and the curvilinear cresting of the sculptured yew hedge that contains the whole of the lower gar-<lb/>
den in a generous embrace. An outer hedge parallels this hedge, creating a shady walkway around the perimeter of the lower garden.</p>
<p>Close association of the garden with its agrar-<lb/>
ian environs; intimacy of scale and conservative reten-<lb/>
tion of old forms such as lemon gardens; shady <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> of ilex trees, terra-cotta figures, sculptured hedges, and pebble mosaic walks&#x2014;all characteristic elements of the Tuscan garden&#x2014;can be found at La Gam-<lb/>
beraia in Settignano on the outskirts of <name type="place">Florence</name> (figs. 5.35&#x2013;5.38). The artful twentieth-century restoration of this garden forsakes historic accuracy, instead emphasizing the abstract geometries of its Baroque shapes and animating its period character in other ways that are pleasing to contemporary taste.</p>
<p>The place takes its name from that of the origi-<lb/>
nal owners of the property, the Gambarelli family. According to a plaque over the door, in 1610, <name type="pname">Zanobi Lapi</name> erected the handsome simple villa around a cen-<lb/>
tral court. The garden was laid out between 1624 and 1635 by his nephews and heirs. During the eighteenth century, the Capponi family owned the property, and they altered and embellished it with statuary fountains, and a long green bowling alley. A <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi> was set into the hillside beneath the lemon garden at this time. Seriously mutilated during World War II, La Gam-<lb/>
beraia was subsequently acquired by <name type="pname">Marcello Marchi</name>, who restored it to its present excellent condition.</p>

<p>Entirely different in spirit from the quiet conservatism and unassuming beauty of Tuscan gardens, Isola Bella, Count Carlo Borromeo's grandiose fantasy in Lake Maggiore in northern <name type="place">Italy</name>, is unsurpassed as an illus-<lb/>
tration of the theatrical character of Italian Baroque design (fig. 5.39, see pp. 2&#x2013;3). Today Isola Bella is more lush and romantically patinated by time than it was when, from 1630 to 1670, the Borromeos leveled an island off the coast of Stresa in Lake Maggiore and erected the great tiered galleon of a garden named in honor of Count Carlo's wife, <name type="pname">Isabella</name>. The funda-<lb/>
mental theatricality of this unusual landscape comes from its phantasmagorical appearance, rising improb-<lb/>

To the left of the villa entrance, extending all along its eastern side and beyond to the north and south, lies the turf bowling alley flanked by a high, urn-surmounted retaining wall of stucco. The long surface of this wall is broken by painted panels of geometric design and enlivened by a pattern of dark stucco resembling a balustrade.

<p>By the eighteenth century, courts all over <name type="place">Europe</name> were imitating the design concepts developed a century earlier by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> in <name type="place">France</name>. At Caserta, near Naples, <name type="pname">Charles III</name>, the Bourbon king of <name type="place">Spain</name>, Naples, and Sicily, hired Luigi Vanvitelli (<date when="1700">1700</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773">1773</date>) to design the gardens of La Reggia in 1752 in a man-<lb/>
ner and on a scale clearly meant to rival Versailles. The immensely long canal axis, nearly 2 miles (5 kilo-<lb/>
meters), does not stretch illusionistically into the distance, however, but ends in an Italian-style hill-<lb/>
side cascade (fig. 5.41). This monument to Bourbon grandeur is made vacuous by its sheer size, since it lacks the same understanding of optics based on laws of perspective, the same integration of parts into mathematical harmonies of scale, and the artful grade manipulations and incidents of intricacy that give variety and surprise to <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s grand composi-<lb/>
tions. In short, the subtle intelligence that provided both grace and power in <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s designs is largely absent in Vanvitelli's work, and Caserta remains inter-<lb/>
esting primarily for the ambition it displays.</p>
<p>The French classical style, as we have seen, was informed by Cartesian mathematics and the politics of authority. It was forged in the crucible of the post-<lb/>
Copernican view of the cosmos as not being Earth-<lb/>
centered and spherically contained, but heliocentric and open-ended. The Italian Baroque style, on the other hand, expresses a lofty confidence based less on science than upon its rich patrimony from the antique past. This confidence was combined with theatrical zest to produce bold architectural effects and grandiose sculptural compositions. Together, these two traditions were imitated in countless places, sometimes separately, sometimes in combination, often with modifications because of local culture and topographic conditions. Until revolution and Roman-<lb/>
ticism discredited the royal and aristocratic patronage that had created them, they constituted a formal design vocabulary that became the idiom of courts and cities throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>he seventeenth century saw the birth of scientific modernism in Western culture. A probing inquiry into the nature of nature, the growing reliance on inductive reasoning, and a new confidence based upon a continuously expanding understanding of the uni-<lb/>
verse was paralleled in landscape design by the extension of axes beyond the boundaries of the garden. The universe and all nature were now perceived in dimensions far grander and more indeter-<lb/>
minate than those imagined by the Christian theologians and Aris-<lb/>
totelian scholastics of the Middle Ages, or even by the Renaissance humanists whose curiosity and methods of inquiry helped build a bridge between the medieval and modern worldviews.</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter Five, confidence in human power and growing dominion over nature as well as celebration of the intel-<lb/>
ligible order of nature revealed by science infused the work of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and other seventeenth-century landscape designers. They had by this time completely abandoned the imagery inherent in the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi>, the garden as a sanctified precinct set apart from the world at large. Instead, they laid out long axes that stretched to the horizon and built monuments that celebrated human author-<lb/>
ity and achievement.</p>
<p>The increased power that human beings perceived themselves to hold over their own destiny grew in tandem with the power of nation-states and the institutionalization of monarchical govern-<lb/>
ment. <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> created at <name type="place">Versailles</name> the ultimate symbol of auto-<lb/>
cratic rule, and the value of that landscape in bolstering a royal reputation was not lost upon the other princes of <name type="place">Europe</name>. The growing power of states necessitated a concomitant increase in the dignity and monumentality of capital cities, which now expanded their role in manifesting national cultural identity. The extension and protection of state boundaries through new developments in military engineering, first apparent in <name type="place">France</name> under <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, ren-<lb/>
dered old city walls obsolete and made possible an expansion of urban territory that paralleled the outward extension of the gar-<lb/>
den's axes. The axial plan of <name type="place">Versailles</name> was applied to parts of the layout and redevelopment of the city itself as well as to the con-<lb/>
struction of many <name type="place">Versailles</name>-inspired princely gardens.</p>
<p>The landscape formulas of French classicism thus provided an international style applicable to both the design of gardens and the building of cities, especially capitals. Although French-inspired, this style was never completely severed from its Italian roots, and the design influence of that country remained a potent one. <name type="place">Italy</name>, with its heritage of antique architecture and artifacts, was the prin-<lb/>
cipal destination of travelers on the Grand Tour in the eighteenth century. Italian artists continued to find employment abroad in the construction of palaces, gardens, and theaters as well as in the decoration of public places with fountains and monuments. Indeed, it was in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century city plan-<lb/>
ning that the decorative motifs and theatrical grandeur of the Ital-<lb/>
ian Baroque style were combined with the geometries of French authoritarian classicism to create a new international vocabulary of urban design.</p>
<p>Where there was sufficient wealth and centralized govern-<lb/>
mental control to implement grand urban designs, the monumental cityscape of radiating axes emerged, as in Karlsruhe, <name type="place">Germany</name>. Streets were no longer conceived as residual spaces between build-<lb/>
ings but instead were consciously composed perspectives like those found in the theater. The city itself became a giant stage for the pageantry of church and state, with tree-lined streets punctuated by ceremonial arches. Some of these were temporary construc-<lb/>
tions for special occasions; others were permanent commemora-<lb/>
tions. Heroic sculptures formed the legendary <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> of the urban scene. Along with columns and obelisks, they acted as focal points, terminating vistas. In this fashion, the modern city was created, a city with broad avenues suitable for regimented and rapid movement and with public places enlivened by appropriate sym-<lb/>
bols of national and local culture.</p>

<p>The flow of ideas depends upon means of commu-<lb/>
nication. Since antiquity, direct observation of foreign scenes by travelers had carried innovations in archi-<lb/>
tecture and landscape design to new places. But begin-<lb/>
ning in the sixteenth century, the growth of printing and the publication of books and albums of engrav-<lb/>
ings were responsible for the rapid spread of land-<lb/>
scape design concepts. Architects, sculptors, and hydraulic engineers still responded to commissions from princes. But by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, stylistic imitation became far easier because engravings served not only as proud records of exist-<lb/>
ing gardens but also as examples from which prospec-<lb/>
tive garden makers derived inspiration.</p>

Similarly, <name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name>'s <hi rend="italic">I quattro libri dell'architettura</hi> of <date when="1570">1570</date>, was, like <name type="pname">Alberti</name>'s work, primarily a book of architectural instruction rather than an illustrated catalog of designs.<ref target="#CH6-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, a French architect, published several books of his own engravings of designs for knot designs, fountains, and garden pavilions.

volume work, <hi rend="italic">Les plus excellents bastiments de <name type="place">France</name></hi> (<date when="1576">1576</date> and <date when="1579">1579</date>), recorded and promoted the French Renaissance garden style.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Trait&#x00E9; du jardinage</hi> of <name type="pname">Jacques Boyceau</name> (<date when="1638">1638</date>) and <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Le Jardin de plaisir</hi> (<date when="1651">1651</date>), pioneered how-to books on the layout of ornamen-<lb/>

As valuable as these texts were, they could not compensate for the serious lack of a text and illustrations detailing the achievements of <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> over half a century.</p>
<p>In <date when="1709">1709</date>, the publisher <name type="pname">Pierre Mariette</name> remedied this situation when he brought out <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pra-<lb/>

nated the French seventeenth-century style to an international audience (fig. 6.1). <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s book was written as a manual for aristocrats wishing to lay out <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>-style gardens on plots ranging from 3 to 60 acres.

<figDesc>6.1. An example of the illustrations from <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pratique du jardinage</hi> by <name type="pname">A.-J. Dezallier d'Argenville</name>. As many of the book's engraved plates were drawn by <name type="pname">Alexandre Le Blond</name> (<date when="1679">1679</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719">1719</date>), an architect and follower of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> who also contributed several <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs to this work, the title page of the English editions published by <name type="pname">John Johns</name> bears <name type="pname">Le Blond</name>'s name as author; this has confused some garden historians in the past.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>First, a garden designer should make art yield to nature. <name type="pname">Dezallier</name> did not mean by this what the English later would mean, that a garden should appear unstudied, an integral part of the larger natu-<lb/>
ral scene, but rather that topographic and other char-<lb/>
acteristics of the site should be considered carefully. Further, ostentatious display of wealth through exces-<lb/>
sive ornament should be abandoned in favor of sim-<lb/>
ple steps, turf banks, ramps, natural arbors, and hedges without trellises.</p>
<p>Nor did giving way to nature mean to <name type="pname">Dezallier</name> abandoning geometrical design and eliminating topi-<lb/>
ary and other regimented horticultural effects. Rather, for him it consisted of eradicating all Renaissance intricacy, which now appeared as mere fussiness, and clarifying and unifying all garden parts into a design that respected both the natural site conditions and the patron's purse. The French seventeenth-century gar-<lb/>
den had already chastened the intricacies of Renais-<lb/>
sance style, but it was still elaborately ornamental and therefore exceedingly labor-intensive. Further
<pb n="196"/>
<pb n="196" type="orig"/>
simplification was needed if it was to be developed on a broad scale by aristocrats who did not possess the same resources as royalty.</p>
<p>Second, according to <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>, a designer should be careful never to cloud and darken gardens by making them dull and gloomy with thickets and excessive ground cover. He found openness desirable, especially around a building, inasmuch as a building needs its own envelope of space. But, as a third prin-<lb/>
ciple, he enjoined the designer from making the gar-<lb/>
den <hi rend="italic">too</hi> open. He recommended "contrariety and change," a happy balance between openness and enclosure and, through the arrangement of sight lines, the possibility of mystery and surprise. As a final cardinal rule, the designer should manipulate the ter-<lb/>
rain and planting so as to conceal the garden's bound-<lb/>
aries, thus making it appear larger than its actual size.<ref target="#CH6-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The second part of <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s book contains practical information on transcribing geometrical fig-<lb/>
ures onto the ground plane as well as on methods of digging and dressing the ground, techniques for build-<lb/>
ing terraces and stairs, and instructions for laying out <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs, planting trees, and building basins and fountains. Widely read, <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et pratique du jardi-<lb/>
nage</hi> was instrumental in spreading French taste throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>. The noted architect <name type="pname">Nicodemus Tessin</name> the Younger (<date when="1654">1654</date>&#x2013;<date when="1728">1728</date>), who served the Swedish court, copied two sections of this important text verbatim for the instruction of his son, adding such comments as he found necessary to make it relevant to climatic and topographical conditions in <name type="place">Stockholm</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Dezallier</name> wrote his book at the same time that <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> was founding his new capital on the Neva and after the Holy Roman Empire had virtually dissolved into many Germanic principalities. Court architecture was experiencing its heyday, and there were many opportunities for applying <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s land-<lb/>
scape design precepts to the construction of princely gardens. From one perspective <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et pratique du jardinage</hi> could be seen as a codification of the prin-<lb/>
ciples of French seventeenth-century landscape design at the very moment it was going out of fashion, par-<lb/>
ticularly in <name type="place">England</name> and soon in <name type="place">France</name> itself. From another point of view, however, it provided a useful and popular guide for those who wanted to continue an important aspect of royal and aristocratic tradition almost until the time of the French Revolution. Con-<lb/>
sequently, its results are evident in many courtly gar-<lb/>
dens of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>In another important pattern book, <hi rend="italic">De la distri-<lb/>
bution des maisons de plaisance</hi> (<date when="1737">1737</date>) by <name type="pname">Jacques-<lb/>
-Fran&#x00E7;ois Blondel</name>, one finds architectural, landscape, and interior plans and elevations in the classical style. <name type="pname">Blondel</name>'s garden plans display axial symmetry and other hallmarks of that style and include numerous illustrations of garden ornament: treillage, fountains, belvederes, embroidered <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, grillwork, urns, tro-<lb/>
phies, sphinxes, herms, and more. His designs demon-<lb/>
strate how aristocrats without royal resources at their command can achieve on a modest scale effects simi-<lb/>
lar to those at <name type="place">Versailles</name>. Actually, <name type="pname">Blondel</name> stands at the juncture of what is often referred to as the French Classical style and that of the French Picturesque. In his <hi rend="italic">Cours d'architecture</hi> (<date when="1773">1773</date>), he praises the beauties to be found in views of simple nature outside the gar-<lb/>
den bounds, and this, along with the Rococo delicacy of his designs, indicates the burgeoning picturesque taste and interest in pastoral themes.</p>

vive. His 3- and 6-acre gardens cleverly give an illusion of grandeur within a small compass, and he warns his readers that elaborate ornament demands a royal purse. Yet there were royal purses still to be found, as well as cheap labor for massive construction works.</p>
<p>Late in the reign of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> and for decades thereafter, the resident court and the court city became the pattern throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>, from Hamp-<lb/>
ton Court in <name type="place">England</name> under <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> (ruled <date when="1689">1689</date>&#x2013;<date when="1702">1702</date>) to <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> in <name type="place">Russia</name>, founded by <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> (<date when="1682">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1725">1725</date>) in <date when="1703">1703</date>, to <name type="place">Drottningholm</name> in <name type="place">Stockholm</name>, commissioned by the dowager queen <name type="pname">Hedvig Leonora</name> and built between <date when="1680">1680</date> and <date when="1700">1700</date>, to the <name type="pname">Buen Retiro</name> in <name type="place">Madrid</name>, created during the reign of <name type="place">Philip IV</name> (ruled <date when="1621">1621</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665">1665</date>). <name type="place">Central Europe</name> offered many opportunities for absolute rule and its princely trappings. The Peace of Westphalia of <date when="1648">1648</date> conclud-<lb/>
ing the Thirty Years' War had brought about the col-<lb/>
lapse of the Holy Roman Empire and the weakening of Hapsburg rule along with the concomitant empow-<lb/>
erment of many German princes. As these wealthy men assumed an almost fully sovereign status, they inevitably sought to aggrandize their electorates, king-<lb/>
doms, principalities, and dukedoms with palace gar-<lb/>
dens built according to French taste, some of which were actual copies of French designs.</p>
<p>There were, nevertheless, essential cultural and physical differences from country to country, which accounted for various vernacular design dialects in the language of the new international-style garden. A closer examination of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> and <name type="place">England</name> in particular shows versions of the French theme at a time of self-conscious nationalism. Less secure in their boundaries than either the English or the French, German principalities showed the influence of new developments in military design in their treatment of the French landscape model.</p>

<p>The Dutch did not create a wholly indigenous style but instead adapted the Renaissance landscape idiom developed elsewhere to their country's geography of canalized land reclamation and its strong tradition of urban bourgeois prosperity. Gradually recognized as a nation in its own right after the expulsion of Span-<lb/>
ish rule in the seventeenth century, the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> exhibited the prosperity of its economic ruling class in many private gardens. Even monarchical ambi-<lb/>
tions were tempered by the circumstances of topog-<lb/>
raphy and the pragmatic values of a mercantile nation, making the Dutch and Anglo-Dutch gardens of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> more intimate in scale, more compartmentalized, and less grandly unified than their French prototypes.</p>
<p>The Dutch designed compact gardens and sub-<lb/>
stituted variety and intricacy for broad effects. The influence of the Mannerist designer and publisher of numerous architectural pattern books, <name type="pname">Hans Vrede-<lb/>
man de Vries</name> (<date when="1527">1527</date>&#x2013;<date when="1606">1606</date>), whose <hi rend="italic">Hortorum viridario-<lb/>
rumque elegantes et multiplicis formae</hi> of <date when="1583">1583</date> set the tone in this regard, was long-lasting. The engravings in this influential pattern book show many variations on the theme of the urban or suburban garden: gallery-surrounded <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> of <hi rend="italic">pi&#x00E8;ces coup&#x00E9;es</hi> (grass cutwork) divided by <hi rend="italic">berceaux</hi> (arched trellises) and accented with topiary and fountains (figs. 6.2a and 6.2b). For de Vries, garden enlargement was additive, consisting of multiplied design units, or garden rooms, rather than the integrated expansion of the garden's parts to a new design scale. Like other design-<lb/>
ers from the Renaissance onward, he had enthusias-<lb/>
tically studied the treatise of the ancient Roman architectural theorist <name type="pname">Vitruvius Pollio</name> (active 46&#x2013;30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>). He was also familiar with <hi rend="italic">Tutte l'opere d'ar-<lb/>
chitettura</hi> by the Renaissance theorist <name type="pname">Sebastiano Ser-<lb/>
lio</name> (<date when="1475">1475</date>&#x2013;<date when="1554">1554</date>). His own schemes, rendered with the exaggerated perspective characteristic of Mannerism, contain various forms derived from ancient and Renaissance architecture, such as obelisks and pyra-<lb/>
mids. Although de Vries gave his pattern gardens the names of the classical orders codified by <name type="pname">Serlio</name>, the terms&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Doric</hi> for rectilinear geometric beds and <hi rend="italic">Ionic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Corinthian</hi> for those of circular and labyrinthine construction&#x2014;are more imaginative than apt.</p>

<p>An exuberant use of topiary and a native taste for genre subjects in garden statuary characterized the many gardens that lined the banks of suburban rivers and canals, providing weekend retreats for wealthy merchants. These gardens afforded a two-<lb/>
way spectacle, since they provided an unfolding scene of great interest to boat passengers and, being fur-<lb/>
nished with pavilions and platforms overlooking the water, offered their owners the pleasure of observing the water parade.</p>
<p>Although the Dutch appropriated the seven-<lb/>
teenth-century French landscape style, they reduced its grandeur and scale to suit the topography and social expectations of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>. We see this in the now impeccably restored royal gardens of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> in the eastern part of the country, the Veluwe, a nonarable rolling landscape of low-growing brush and heather. This is excellent country for the pursuit of game, and like <name type="place">Versailles</name>, <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> had its origin as a hunting lodge. As Stadholder of Gelderland after <date when="1672">1672</date>, <name type="pname">Prince William III</name> of Orange had hunting rights to the Veluwe. Being a passionate sportsman, he pur-<lb/>
chased the old castle of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> with the notion of building a more elegant and modern hunting estab-<lb/>
lishment elsewhere on the property.</p>
<p>Work began in <date when="1686">1686</date> under the supervision of the Dutch architect <name type="pname">Jacob Roman</name> (<date when="1640">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1716">1716</date>) accord-<lb/>
ing to designs thought to have been developed by the Academy of Architecture in <name type="place">Paris</name>. Simultaneously, following the revocation of the <date when="1685">1685</date> Edict of Nantes, the <name type="pname">French Huguenot</name> designer <name type="pname">Daniel Marot</name> (<date when="1661">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752">1752</date>) moved to the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, and he was soon employed as the principal designer of the new palace's interiors and gardens. This fact accounts for the remarkable decorative unity between the two, with <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi> echoing the arabesques of molded ceilings, damask wall coverings, and iron grillwork. Between <date when="1695">1695</date> and <date when="1699">1699</date>, subsequent to the corona-<lb/>
tion of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> as king and queen of <name type="place">England</name> in <date when="1689">1689</date>, their gardens at <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> were exten-<lb/>
sively remodeled by <name type="pname">Roman</name>, <name type="pname">Marot</name>, and <name type="pname">Romeyn de Hooghe</name> (<date when="1645">1645</date>&#x2013;<date when="1708">1708</date>) to make them suitable for enter-<lb/>
taining state visitors when the joint sovereigns were in residence in the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Het Loo</name> displays its debt to <name type="place">Versailles</name> in its strong central axis with ornamental <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> symmetrically arranged along it and its use of sculpture depicting classical subjects. But a closer look reveals important differences, the most pronounced being its relative modesty, intimacy of scale, sense of containment, and lack of transition between art and nature. Where <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name> virtually explodes into the surrounding space, <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> is strictly confined within its rectilinear enclos-<lb/>
ing walls like earlier gardens of the Renaissance. The principal axis of the Lower Garden extends beyond its boundary, but the twin arms of the curving colonnade at the far end of the Upper Garden hold it in a firm embrace, thereby vitiating its outward thrust (fig. 6.4). Nor has <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> major transverse axes like those that open <name type="place">Versailles</name> and Vaux-le-Vicomte to distant prospects of rural countryside.</p>
<p>The Lower Garden near the palace is laid out in square compartments as in a Renaissance garden, and this is also true of the King's Garden and Queen's Gar-<lb/>
den on either side of it (figs. 6.5, 6.6). The French and Dutch designers of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> employed none of the compensation for optical foreshortening one finds in <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s more sophisticated designs, but they relied instead on the simpler geometries of an earlier period. The pair of elaborate trellis arbors in the Queen's Garden are similar to those of Renaissance gardens.</p>
<p>Besides the containment of Baroque ornamen-<lb/>
tal elements within an enclosed orthogonal frame-<lb/>
work reminiscent of Renaissance gardens, the most significant difference between Dutch and French sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century gardens lies in the role played by the canal in each. At <name type="place">Versailles</name>, Chantilly, and elsewhere in <name type="place">France</name>, the canals that help drain the land are boldly scaled ornamental sheets of water used to create the principal axes of the garden. In the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, where
<pb n="199"/>
<pb n="199" type="orig"/>
much of the country lies below sea level, a ubiquitous functional canal system actually creates much of the land. This system divides the Dutch landscape into rec-<lb/>
tilinear units, so that canals form transportation arter-<lb/>
ies and also mark property boundaries. Although purely ornamental canals were constructed in some of the larger aristocratic gardens, these never assumed the same importance as the broad water axes of French gardens. At <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>, for instance, a pair of nar-<lb/>
row parallel canals divides the Upper Garden from the Lower Garden. These are bordered by tree-lined promenades similar to those flanking the canals of the countryside at large (fig. 6.7). In addition, because of the scarcity of stone, architectural cascades such as those at <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> were necessarily small in scale and the exception rather than the rule (fig. 6.8).</p>

<p>The French landscape tradition had only a brief life in <name type="place">England</name>, particularly after eighteenth-century Whig aristocrats, who represented the country's increasingly powerful antiroyalist commitment to par-<lb/>
liamentary government, rejected Gallic influence on the grounds that it symbolized monarchical abso-<lb/>
lutism. Nor did the Counter-Reformation assert its Baroque splendor there as it did in the European Catholic monarchies. The Renaissance literature of <name type="pname">Shakespeare</name> and <name type="pname">Bacon</name> is filled with images indicat-<lb/>
ing the delight in nature of a people blessed with a landscape already endowed with much gentle beauty. <name type="pname">Shakespeare</name>'s plays and poems are filled with pastoral images and scenes of sylvan revels, in which he men-<lb/>
tions numerous garden flowers and wildflowers. Bacon's essay "Of Gardens" (<date when="1625">1625</date>) points the way toward both the sensuous and the sensible in garden design. He lists all the flowers and fruits that provide horticultural pleasure at various seasons of the year, while disdaining knot gardens, which he character-<lb/>
izes as "toys" worthy only of a pastry chef.<ref target="#CH6-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The pastoral literature of antiquity also played an important role in the English version of the Renais-<lb/>
sance dialectic between art and nature. The vision of rural contentment conjured by <name type="pname">Virgil</name>, the most romantic of the ancient pastoralists, had an especially
<pb n="200"/>
<pb n="200" type="orig"/>
profound influence, inspiring poets and landscape designers alike. <name type="pname">Ovid</name> furnished a host of woodland deities with which to populate English groves. And not only the "saints" of <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>'s Commonwealth, but many royalists, too, found ancient role models in Horace, who equated industrious husbandry with republican virtue. The treatises of <name type="pname">Cato</name>, <name type="pname">Varro</name>, and <name type="pname">Columella</name> were mined for practical information on agricultural practices. For the gentry as well as the aristocracy, Pliny the Younger's vision of <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>, or intellectually productive exurban leisure, gave author-<lb/>
ity for the use of country houses and gardens as places to demonstrate an interest in both new and anti-<lb/>
quarian knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, late Renaissance architecture in <name type="place">Eng-<lb/>
land</name>, thanks to <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name> (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652">1652</date>), rested on the pure geometries of <name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name>'s classical style. Even in the more robust grandeur of <name type="pname">Jones</name>'s succes-<lb/>
sors&#x2014;<name type="pname">Christopher Wren</name> (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723">1723</date>), <name type="pname">Nicholas Hawksmoor</name> (<date when="1661">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1736">1736</date>), and <name type="pname">John Vanbrugh</name> (<date when="1664">1664</date>&#x2013;<date when="1726">1726</date>)&#x2014;English architecture shunned the abso-<lb/>
lutist overtones of the decoratively refined French style and avoided the flamboyance of the exuberantly ornamental Italian Baroque. This fact necessarily bore consequences for landscape design. <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s spare yet Olympian style was vigorously revived by <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name>'s circle in the eighteenth century, when architectural simplicity based upon ancient models gained even greater political connotations than in the seventeenth. The Palladian style helped place English landscape design upon an Italian foundation. Further, the scale of English gardens remained closer to the relatively intimate scale of Italian ones, and English topography provided more opportunities for terrac-<lb/>
ing in the Italian manner than did the plains of <name type="place">France</name> or the lowlands of <name type="place">Northern Europe</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>

Engraving c. <date when="1632">1632</date>. The garden proper consisted of three principal divisions built around the central axis. Near the house this avenue was flanked with square compartments of <hi rend="italic">broderie</hi> overlooked by terraced walks. The middle section contained a pair of arbor-bracketed groves (counterparts of the French <hi rend="italic">berceaux</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi>) through which ran the Nadder. This stream was not canalized, as would have been the case in a French garden, but left to take a naturally irregular course traversing the symmetrical groves. At the far end, in front of <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name>'s fine architectural grotto, was a lawn divided by curving tree- and hedge-lined walks, in the center of which stood a bronze cast by <name type="pname">Hubert Le Sueur</name> of the antique sculpture known as the Borghese Gladiator. On either side of it were arbors for strolling on hot days.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>The conflation of antiquarian interest with polit-<lb/>
ical values received a further boost from travel. Eng-<lb/>
lish aristocrats, already steeped in Latin literature, formed strong direct associations with <name type="place">Italy</name> in the sev-<lb/>
enteenth century, when taking the Grand Tour became practicable and fashionable. Thus, Italian gar-<lb/>
den influence unmediated by that of <name type="place">France</name> played a greater role in <name type="place">England</name> than on the Continent. Sev-<lb/>
eral garden patrons attempted to recapture the idyl-<lb/>
lic spirit of the ancient gardens of literature, as well as to imitate the poetic associations found in Italian Renaissance gardens such as that of the Villa d'Este through the use of statuary and grottoes in axial ter-<lb/>
raced compositions.</p>
<p>These English nobles had a strong interest in scientific discovery. This helps account for their fas-<lb/>
cination with the technological aspects of garden hydrology as embodied in the ingenious automata&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">giocchi d'acqua</hi>&#x2014;they had seen in Italian gardens. A popular treatise by <name type="pname">Salomon de Caus</name> (c. <date when="1577">1577</date>&#x2013;<date when="1626">1626</date>), <hi rend="italic">Les Raisons des forces mouvantes</hi> (<date when="1615">1615</date>), made the mechanics of automata familiar to them. De Caus, a French Huguenot, had spent three years in <name type="place">Italy</name> as a young man and, upon coming to <name type="pname">James I</name>'s court in <date when="1610">1610</date>, introduced waterworks technology, terracing, and other Italian gardening concepts. The English aristocratic mania for grotto construction reflected a desire to emulate the grottoes of Italian gardens and to establish the grotto's status as a place for sci-<lb/>
entific study.<ref target="#CH6-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref> Like the popular contemporary cabi-<lb/>
nets of curiosities, these grottoes contained mineral and rock specimens as well as collections of marine shells. They also served as laboratories for a variety of experiments combining hydraulic machinery with natural forces.</p>
<p>Garden prospects, including the scenery beyond the garden boundaries, served the same function as perspective backdrops in the theater. "Prospect" was an early and often-cited value in the development of the English garden. By evoking ancient Roman forms and including real British ruins&#x2014;mostly those of old monasteries, for which there was much antiquarian enthusiasm&#x2014;these English gardens became mem-<lb/>
ory theaters and palimpsests of an ennobled past. Stages for social intercourse and entertainment, they also became arenas of philosophical contemplation and dramatic meditation upon national and family history. At <name type="pname">Wilton</name> and other seventeenth-century gar-<lb/>
dens, the prospects contained elements of association with imperial <name type="place">Rome</name>. In addition, the notion that the
<pb n="201"/>
<pb n="201" type="orig"/>
ruins of medieval <name type="place">Britain</name> could express <name type="place">England</name>'s own antique greatness was gaining currency.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Isaac de Caus</name> (fl. <date when="1612">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1655">1655</date>), the son or nephew of Salomon de Caus, collaborated with <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name> on the design of the most famous garden in <name type="place">England</name> in its day, that of <name type="pname">Wilton House</name> (fig. 6.9). The visitor to <name type="pname">Wilton</name> today is scarcely aware of the buried splen-<lb/>
dor of the original garden because it has been revised several times over the years, most notably during the eighteenth century by the ninth Earl of Pembroke. His Palladian bridge of <date when="1737">1737</date> and towering cedars remain as relics of the eighteenth century, but they are only the most visible parts of the palimpsest. There are the remains of a splendid grotto (now a schoolhouse) and other scattered fragments of the garden that was the pride of <name type="pname">Philip Herbert</name>, fourth earl of Pembroke, in the <date when="1630">1630</date>s. Then, <name type="pname">Wilton</name>'s greatly admired garden offered hospitality to the fashionable and learned world.</p>
<p>The earl's gardeners laid out a symmetrical land-<lb/>
scape along a central axis leading to <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name>'s por-<lb/>
ticoed structure and beyond to a green amphitheater and wooded grove. There the prospect culminated in a Roman-style triumphal arch topped by an eques-<lb/>
trian statue. Behind the loggia of <name type="pname">Jones</name>'s structure, which was decorated with marble bas-reliefs and may have served as a banqueting chamber, and beneath the terrace connecting the garden with the wooded slope beyond, was an extraordinary three-chambered grotto, a particular source of <name type="pname">Wilton</name>'s fame.</p>
<p>Within it, automata, mechanically propelled waterworks, delighted the earl's guests. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s influence later demystified grottoes and made such mechanical marvels as the ones <name type="pname">Isaac de Caus</name> installed at <name type="pname">Wilton</name> seem puerile. But in early-seventeenth-cen-<lb/>
tury <name type="place">England</name>, where there was little distinction between science and art, the two were combined in many ingenious experiments.</p>
<p>The pleasures represented by <name type="pname">Wilton</name> ceased and garden making stopped during the Commonwealth (<date when="1649">1649</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660">1660</date>). Throughout these Puritan times, agri-<lb/>
cultural prosperity was encouraged, but ornamental horticulture was not. Several old gardens were inten-<lb/>
tionally destroyed, and in <name type="place">London</name> some of the royal parks were actually put up for sale. Following the Restoration in <date when="1660">1660</date>, however, royalty and aristocracy vigorously resumed their garden-building activities. The French garden designer <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name> (d. c. <date when="1665">1665</date>), who had introduced the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi> to <name type="place">England</name> during the reign of <name type="pname">Charles I</name>, returned and took up the position of Royal Gardener at <name type="pname">St. James</name> and other royal palaces.</p>

</figure>
<p>The royal gardens where <name type="pname">Mollet</name> worked are now urban parks, greatly altered through time, and most of the ones of the seventeenth-century nobility have vanished or, like <name type="pname">Wilton</name>, have been revised over the centuries in accordance with new styles and cul-<lb/>
tural values. But the forms of many of these survive in the engravings of <name type="pname">Johannes Kip</name> (<date when="1653">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1722">1722</date>) and <name type="pname">Leonard Knyff</name> (<date when="1579">1579</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649">1649</date>), whose topographical bird's-eye views were published in the early eighteenth century in both English and French: <hi rend="italic">Britannia Illus-<lb/>
trata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Nouveau Th&#x00E9;&#x00E2;tre de la Grande Bretagne</hi>. Con-<lb/>
temporary with <name type="place">Versailles</name> and sometimes vast in scale, the gardens depicted by <name type="pname">Kip</name> and <name type="pname">Knyff</name> include those at Badminton in <name type="place">Gloucestershire</name>, built by <name type="pname">Henry</name>, <name type="place">duke of Beaufort</name>, in <date when="1682">1682</date>, and <name type="pname">Chatsworth</name> in <name type="place">Derbyshire</name>, seat of the dukes of Devonshire, laid out in <date when="1685">1685</date>.</p>
<p>Although their many intricately designed sec-<lb/>
tions were planned symmetrically, these gardens lack the cadenced thrust of strong principal axes and hence the controlling organization and compositional unity found in contemporary French examples (fig. 6.11). Indeed, the transverse axes in these gardens often gain as much as or more importance than the central one. They are Dutch-influenced, and relatively anti-author-<lb/>
itarian in spirit. Many were built following the Glori-<lb/>
ous Revolution of <date when="1688">1688</date> and during the constitutional monarchy of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>. They perhaps also illustrate a characteristically British sense that reti-<lb/>
cence and understatement are nobler attributes of the great and wealthy than ostentatious display.</p>
<p>Dutch influence in British garden design, with its inference of decorous bourgeois prosperity, was carried to some parts of colonial <name type="place">America</name>, notably <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, <name type="place">Virginia</name>. In <name type="place">England</name>, it was evident in the increased use of topiary and canals as garden fea-<lb/>
tures. These canals were not employed in the French manner as extensions of the principal axis; instead, as in the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, designers placed independent bod-<lb/>
ies of water at one side of the garden, often with one or more attendant pavilions, as at Westbury Court, begun at the end of the seventeenth century by <name type="pname">May-<lb/>
nard Colchester</name> on his ancestral estate in <name type="place">Glouces-<lb/>
tershire</name> (fig. 6.12).</p>
<p>Wishing to avoid the bad air of <name type="place">London</name> and the importunate courtiers massed at the old ramshackle palace of Whitehall, <name type="pname">King William</name>, who was asth-<lb/>

<pb n="203"/>
<pb n="203" type="orig"/>
the atmosphere of court intrigue she had witnessed as the daughter of <name type="pname">James II</name>, chose Hampton Court as their principal residence. They incorporated <name type="pname">Charles II</name>'s initial garden design into a new plan, summoning <name type="pname">Daniel Marot</name> to create the Great Parterre as a plant showcase similar to the one he had made at <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>'s palace of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>. <name type="pname">Queen Mary</name>'s Glass Case Garden for tender exotic plants and elaborate topiary&#x2014;pyramidal yews, clipped box, and globular mounds of bay and holly&#x2014;recalled similar features of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>. The monarchs also summoned <name type="pname">Christo-<lb/>
pher Wren</name> to build a large new palace adjacent to <name type="pname">Thomas Cardinal Wolsey</name>'s Tudor one. Two impres-<lb/>
sive sides of the proposed square palace block were completed: the facade to the east facing the main gar-<lb/>
den, known as the Great Fountain garden for its large central fountain, and the one on the south looking out upon the Privy Garden.</p>
<p>In <date when="1699">1699</date>, <name type="pname">Henry Wise</name> (<date when="1653">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) lowered and lengthened the Privy Garden in order to provide a view of the river Thames and the Barge Walk. Wise was a partner with <name type="pname">George London</name> (d. <date when="1714">1714</date>) in their recently formed Brompton Park Nurseries in Kens-<lb/>
ington, suppliers of much of the plant material in, as well as designers of, many of the gardens surround-<lb/>
ing the great country seats depicted in the engravings of Kip and Knyff.</p>
<p>Today the enormous overgrown yews in the Great Fountain Garden at Hampton Court, their pyramidal outlines blurred after they were no longer clipped, serve as reminders of the disfavor into which the Anglo-Dutch garden fell in the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. By contrast, within the principalities of <name type="place">Germany</name>, where aristocratic authoritarianism still prevailed, the classical splendor of <name type="place">Versailles</name> became an almost uni-<lb/>
versal model for courtly gardens and urban planning, although, at least initially, some Italian currents ran northward as well.</p>

<p>Northern humanism, as developed by <name type="pname">Erasmus</name>, was more religious in nature than that of <name type="place">Italy</name>, a cultural fact that influenced landscape design. Although the first Renaissance gardens to be observed and imitated in such prosperous cities as <name type="place">Augsburg</name>, <name type="place">Nuremberg</name>, and <name type="place">Frankfurt</name> were those of <name type="place">Italy</name>, German gardens did not readily incorporate the pagan images and erotically charged atmosphere of Italian models until the liber-<lb/>
tine atmosphere of the eighteenth century permitted such license. The vigorous new garden art that flour-<lb/>
ished in <name type="place">Germany</name> combined French and Dutch influ-<lb/>
ences with Italian ones. Not surprisingly in a country of so many regional power centers, these influences were never amalgamated into a distinctive national style. The many Renaissance gardens that were laid out beside town houses, the residences of archbishops, and the castles of princes were enclosed, compart-<lb/>
mentalized rectangular spaces, axially disconnected from the edifices to which they were attached, with intricately designed <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, tunnel-like arbors, balustraded terraces, tubs of plants, sculptural foun-<lb/>
tains, aviaries, grottoes, and gazebos (fig. 6.13).</p>

<p>The most famous German garden in its day was the <name type="place">Hortus Palatinus</name> in <name type="place">Heidelberg</name>, begun in <date when="1615">1615</date> by <name type="pname">Salomon de Caus</name> for <name type="pname">Elizabeth Stuart</name>, daughter of <name type="pname">King James I</name> of <name type="place">England</name>, and her hus-<lb/>
band, <name type="pname">Elector Friedrich V</name> of the Palatinate (fig. 6.14). The garden sits high above the Neckar Valley and consists of a series of L-shaped descending terraces, which were originally subdivided into squares out-<lb/>
lined by pergolas and hedges and ornamented with gazebos, fountains, and statuary. De Caus, being a hydrological engineer and specialist in automata, built numerous grottoes and other water features, which when mechanically activated sounded musi-<lb/>
cal notes and even in some cases played melodies

<p>After the Thirty Years' War ended, garden patrons looked almost entirely to <name type="place">France</name> for inspira-<lb/>
tion, as that country was increasingly the center of economic energy and artistic imagination. German princes imported gardeners and fountain engineers along with design theories as they modified French style to suit their tastes. Dutch influence was also pres-<lb/>
ent, particularly in <name type="pname">Lower Saxony</name> at <name type="place">Hanover</name>, where <name type="pname">Sophie</name>, the daughter of <name type="pname">Frederick V</name> of the Palatinate, who had married <name type="pname">Duke (later Elector) Ernst August</name>, oversaw the creation of the <name type="pname">Grosser Garten</name> at <name type="place">Her-<lb/>
renhausen</name> (fig. 6.15).</p>
<p>In the politically unstable atmosphere of sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century <name type="place">Germany</name>, authority was fragile and transient, and the princely landscape was often con-<lb/>
structed as a symbolic expression of absolutist power, an assertion of control over potentially fractious municipalities. Karlsruhe, the creation in <date when="1715">1715</date> of <name type="pname">Mar-<lb/>
grave Karl Wilhelm</name> of Baden-Durlach, makes this statement with its spiderweb of avenues radiating out-<lb/>
ward from the palace (fig. 6.16). Their indeterminate length made the entire surrounding countryside appear subservient to the margrave.</p>
<p><name type="place">Vienna</name> itself, the imperial capital, continually feared invasion by the Turks, and it was not until after the decisive victory of <date when="1683">1683</date> that garden build-<lb/>
ing on a significant scale occurred there. In <date when="1693">1693</date>, <name type="pname">Prince Eugene</name> of Savoy, a much-admired hero in the recent war, acquired land outside the southern wall of the city and set about building his Belvedere palace and gardens in the French style, a project not completed until <date when="1732">1732</date> (fig. 6.17). Designed by <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois Girard</name> in collaboration with the architect <name type="pname">Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt</name> (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>), the gar-<lb/>
dens, with their broad terraced <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, fountain basins, cascades, clipped hedges, and boxlike pavil-<lb/>
ions facing the Orangery, contain faint but percepti-<lb/>
ble echoes of <name type="pname">Vaux-le-Vicomte</name> and <name type="pname">Marly</name>, evidence of Austrian acceptance of French influence with regard to landscape design. However, in <name type="pname">Hilde-<lb/>
brandt</name>'s architecture, which is strongly indebted to the Italian Baroque style of Francesco Borromini, an underlying Austrian anti-French sentiment is perhaps more evident. Other nobles also built luxurious palaces and gardens nearby as <name type="place">Vienna</name> flourished in its status as a world capital.</p>
<p>In <date when="1693">1693</date>, <name type="pname">Emperor Leopold</name> ordered the court architect <name type="pname">Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach</name> (<date when="1656">1656</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723">1723</date>)<ref target="#CH6-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> to convert the hunting lodge and park at Sch&#x00F6;nbrunn 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the cen-<lb/>
ter of the city into a palace and grounds that would symbolize in its grandeur and magnificence not only Hapsburg imperial power, but also the triumph of the Christian West over Ottoman rule. The original scheme, determinedly Italian rather than French, placed the palace like a beacon on a hill. This plan was too costly and impractical, however, even for an impe-<lb/>
rial purse, and a revised design located it on the plain below (fig. 6.18).</p>
<p>In <date when="1770">1770</date>, <name type="pname">Empress Maria Theresa</name> commissioned the design services of <name type="pname">Ferdinand Hetzendorf</name> in preparing a final plan for the park. In keeping with
<pb n="205"/>
<pb n="205" type="orig"/>
the taste of the age, the architect added an obelisk and an artificial ruin at the terminus of a new diagonal avenue. At the base of the hill he constructed the Nep-<lb/>
tune pool, and, at the end of the long axis on top, he placed a handsome <hi rend="italic">gloriette</hi>, a neoclassical eye-catcher, that brought the august composition to a fitting cli-<lb/>
max (fig. 6.19).</p>
<p>Near Munich, beginning in <date when="1701">1701</date>, <name type="pname">Max Emanuel</name>, elector of Bavaria, began remodeling the Nymphen-<lb/>
burg, the palace and garden built by his father, <name type="pname">Elec-<lb/>
tor Ferdinand Maria</name>, as a present for his mother, <name type="pname">Henriette Adelaide</name> of Savoy, upon his birth. To accomplish this project he sent the architect <name type="pname">Joseph Effner</name> (<date when="1687">1687</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>) to <name type="place">Paris</name> to study the principles of French landscape design. But it was not only the les-<lb/>
sons of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> that Effner carried home from abroad; he also imbibed the more relaxed spirit of the Rococo, the lighthearted, intimately scaled orna-<lb/>
mental style that originated in <name type="place">France</name> in the early eighteenth century. In essence, the Rococo style con-<lb/>
stitutes a last phase of the Baroque, and it is not as robust in its forms or as sober in its iconography as the Baroque. Rococo designers especially prized ele-<lb/>
gant curvaceousness and delicacy of detail. They put a premium on naturalistic floral and rustic forms as well on the creation in gardens of highly picturesque rustic scenery. They extended the long popularity of the grotto, often incorporating into their plans <hi rend="italic">rocaille</hi>, the amorphous, frequently shell-encrusted, artificial rockwork suggestive of coral reefs and caves.</p>
<p>In Rococo design, Baroque forms have been playfully recast to reflect the mores of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi>, which was bored with the grandeur of author-<lb/>
itarian monarchy, even though most aristocrats still adhered to this collapsing political system. Because of increased Western contact with <name type="place">China</name> and a growing enthusiasm for the decorative arts of that country among European aristocrats, the Rococo style also embodies elements of <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>, the decorative rein-<lb/>
terpretation of Chinese forms that first appeared in the seventeenth century and assumed its full propor-<lb/>
tions in the eighteenth century, when pagodas, "Chi-<lb/>
nese" bridges, and tea pavilions became popular features in Western gardens. Rococo designers put a premium on exoticism in general, incorporating into their landscape plans such ornamental structures as "Egyptian pyramids" and "Turkish tents," festively painted wooden pavilions built in imitation of the silk caravan tents of Islamic royalty.</p>

ment, and the Magdalenenklause (<date when="1725">1725</date>), which he designed as a hermitage. The elements of escapist fantasy and hedonistic gaiety that are the essence of Rococo art and that continue to delight visitors to Nymphenburg can be seen in many other Bavarian gardens including the Hofgarten at Veitsh&#x00F6;chheim near Munich (fig. 6.21). The sensual and amorous spirit of the Rococo even conquered Prussian Pots-<lb/>
dam under <name type="pname">Frederick II</name> (ruled <date when="1740">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786">1786</date>).

In one of the <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> beyond the canal that defined the boundary of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> terrace, frivolity and exoticism found full expression in B&#x00FC;ring's Chinese Tea House (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757">57</date>) (fig. 6.23).</p>

<p>French landscape style, particularly after its develop-<lb/>
ment into an eighteenth-century Rococo design idiom, was adopted by princes in <name type="place">Hungary</name>, <name type="place">Poland</name>, and <name type="place">Bohemia</name>. Here where the climate is drier than in <name type="place">France</name>, designers omitted the long canals and ornamental lakes that helped drain French gardens and that were used to brilliant effect by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his followers.</p>
<p>When the Hapsburgs expelled the Turks from <name type="place">Hungary</name> in <date when="1686">1686</date>, several Renaissance palaces, which had been neglected since the Ottoman occupation of <date when="1541">1541</date>, began to be restored. The Austrian architect <name type="pname">Johann Lukas van Hildebrandt</name>, built a summer palace for <name type="pname">Prince Eugene</name> of Savoy on one of the islands in the Danube. It was surrounded by a garden that com-<lb/>
bined the French and Italian influences. Although this garden has now vanished, the one built somewhat later during the <date when="1760">1760</date>s at Esterh&#x00E1;za, the estate in Fer-<lb/>
t&#x00F6;d of Prince Mikl&#x00F3;s Esterh&#x00E1;zy, has been preserved and restored. Esterh&#x00E1;za exemplifies the courtly style that prevailed throughout eastern <name type="place">Europe</name> at this time when the Rococo taste was at its height (fig. 6.24). The layout of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden, with its flower-<lb/>
edged beds, sandstone urns, statuary, and fountains, was based upon an engraving in <hi rend="italic">Le Jardin de plaisir</hi> (<date when="1651">1651</date>) by <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name>. Garden temples, a pair of cas-<lb/>
cades, and a triumphal arch ornamented the <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> surrounding this garden. A Chinese pavilion was built
<pb n="207"/>
<pb n="207" type="orig"/>
in honor of Empress Maria Theresa's visit in <date when="1773">1773</date>. In addition, Esterh&#x00E1;za boasted an opera house, a music building, and a puppet theater. Upon the historic occa-<lb/>
sion of the empress's visit, the court composer, <name type="pname">Franz Joseph Haydn</name>, created two operas to entertain the royal guest. Beyond the ornamental gardens lay a deer park with crisscrossing <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> and also a boar park with avenues radiating from a <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi>.</p>
<p>Although firmly reasserting European stylistic dominance, eighteenth-century Hungarian gardens maintained some of the horticultural elements bequeathed to them by the earlier period of the coun-<lb/>
try's Turkish occupation. These included citrus plants, pomegranates, tulips, and other exotic species. The gardens of the nobility also became showcases for additional non-native species derived from botanical exploration, such as chestnut, catalpa, locust, and hornbeam trees. Like the Rococo follies nearby, exotic plants were prestigious symbols of the garden own-<lb/>
ers' cosmopolitan perspective and scientific interest.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a reaction through-<lb/>
out <name type="place">Europe</name> to the kind of landscapes that perpetu-<lb/>
ated an increasingly discredited authoritarian taste. As we shall see, beginning in the first third of the eigh-<lb/>
teenth century, the English began to produce gardens that were less regular and more naturalistic than those descended from <name type="place">Versailles</name> and derived from the Dutch influence under <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>. As <name type="place">England</name>'s power as a nation rose, English garden design influ-<lb/>
enced Continental taste to an increasing degree. Near the end of the eighteenth century, many European princes and other aristocrats adopted the style known as <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi>&#x2014;and also as <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi>&#x2014;for their garden-building projects. Further, many of their descendants tore out the garden designs they had inherited when the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> reached the height of fashion in the nineteenth century. The popularity of the new English landscape style in the latter part of the eighteenth century helps explain why the Rococo effects of this period, such as <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>, were employed equally in both geometrically formal gar-<lb/>
dens and informal ones and also why the naturaliza-<lb/>
tion of exotic plants went on at the same time in the two kinds of landscape. By turning Baroque forms into whimsy, Rococo ornament became suitable within settings that relied on a naturalistic aesthetic as well as within those that still retained classical design principles of axiality and symmetry. Similarly, exotic plants complemented the penchant for the bizarre found in French Rococo gardens, but these could be also naturalized within a less contrived "Eng-<lb/>
lish" landscape.</p>

These designers modified the

<p>The gardens of the royal palace of <name type="place">Drottning-<lb/>

terwork of <name type="pname">Tessin</name> the Younger (figs. 6.27, 6.28). In the sections of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>'s <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la prac-<lb/>
tique du jardinage</hi> that he later copied as an instructive text for his son, <name type="pname">Carl Gustaf</name>, <name type="pname">Tessin</name> appended commentaries relating to the adaptation of French landscape principles to Nordic conditions. At <name type="place">Drot-<lb/>

He organized these along a single longitudinal axis. Where he could not remove a particularly massive outcrop, he disguised it by building across its face an architectural cascade. To have excavated a canal like the one at <name type="pname">Vaux-le-Vicomte</name> would have been exceed-<lb/>

<p>The landscape style carried out by <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> was a highly cosmopolitan one. Although derived principally from <name type="place">France</name>, it was also shaped by contributions from Italian and Dutch sources. The teams of foreign and native architects and the army of serf laborers who built it were part of an even greater enterprise begun by <name type="pname">Peter</name> in <date when="1712">1712</date>: the construction of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, a capital, industrial city, and naval and mercantile port on the muddy banks of the Neva River. The story of its creation is in this chapter's dis-<lb/>
cussion of the application of the principles of Baroque landscape design to urban planning.</p>
<p>By the time of <name type="pname">Catherine the Great</name> (ruled <date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">1796</date>), English influence had superseded the French in <name type="place">Russia</name>. The empress, who professed to Voltaire in <date when="1772">1772</date>, "I now love to distraction gardens in the English style," hired the English-trained landscape gardener <name type="pname">John Busch</name> (fl. <date when="1730">1730</date>s&#x2013;<date when="1790">1790</date>s) to create a pic-<lb/>
turesque park with meandering water bodies at the summer palace of <name type="pname">Tsarskoye Selo</name> outside <name type="place">St. Peters-<lb/>
burg</name>. The plan for this landscape, which lies adjacent to the earlier Baroque <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi>, bears a superficial resemblance to that of the park that <name type="pname">Gus-<lb/>
tav III</name> and <name type="pname">Piper</name> built next to the French-inspired gar-<lb/>
dens at <name type="place">Drottningholm</name>. <name type="pname">Tsarskoye Selo</name>, like the Swedish royal gardens, boasts several <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>-style pavilions. But to appreciate the breadth of stylistic possibilities found in eighteenth-century landscape design, one must mentally traverse the European con-<lb/>
tinent to its westernmost extremity where French and English influence remained slight, allowing a vigor-<lb/>
ous Iberian version of Baroque and Rococo garden art to flourish.</p>

<p>The Portuguese conquerors who garnered imperial wealth from the <name type="place">East Indies</name> and <name type="place">Brazil</name> built churches, palaces, and monasteries. They also ornamented their small, hilly country with many beautiful gardens that creatively amalgamated several foreign influences. Because of the country's favorable climate, they were able to naturalize many exotic plant species collected by <name type="pname">Jesuit</name> missionaries from abroad. The marquess of Pombal established a botanical garden at Coimbra, the seat of an important Portuguese university, in <date when="1772">1772</date>, and a botanical garden was set up at the same time in Lisbon.</p>
<p>The Portuguese were the heirs of Islamic <name type="place">Spain</name>. Glazed tiles&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">azulejos</hi>&#x2014;painted with arabesque and geometric designs in tones of yellow, blue, and green, had long been manufactured there, and by the fif-<lb/>
teenth century, these were being imported to <name type="place">Portu-<lb/>
gal</name> where they were applied to many kinds of walls and floors, including those found in several gardens.</p>
<p>The Portuguese established their own tile fac-<lb/>
tories as the craft waned in <name type="place">Spain</name>. They expanded their palette of colors and substituted pictorial motifs for the abstract ones required by Islam. At the same time, they devised composite images by fitting together several square tiles. As Baroque and Rococo motifs gained artistic currency, the Portuguese became the undisputed masters of tile design, creat-<lb/>
ing numerous exuberant patterns. This tilework con-<lb/>
stitutes an important element in their virtuosic blending of Islamic, Spanish, Italian, and French influences into an original national landscape style (figs. 6.31, 6.32).</p>
<p>Water tanks, an Islamic legacy, are particularly important features in Portuguese gardens. In sum-<lb/>
<pb n="211"/>
<pb n="211" type="orig"/>
mer droughts, they ensured both the residential water supply and the irrigation of the garden's plants. They were usually placed in a fairly elevated position to allow the water to be distributed by force of gravity. Here the reflectivity of both water and tile combine with the designer's imagination to make these utili-<lb/>
tarian structures into delightfully decorative garden features, as at the Quinta da Balcalhoa and the Pal&#x00E1;-<lb/>
cio dos Marqueses de Fronteira (figs. 6.33, 6.34).</p>
<p>Replete with ornament and sculpture, seven-<lb/>
teenth- and eighteenth-century Portuguese gardens are nevertheless conservative in their overall design. Although some box parterres were laid out in <hi rend="italic">broderie</hi> designs, the design of others, such as that at the Pal&#x00E1;-<lb/>
cio Fronteira, where there is an intricate maze, harks back stylistically to the Renaissance. Decorative shell-<lb/>
work similar to that found in Italian Mannerist grot-<lb/>
toes is abundant here. Even more important, these Portuguese gardens are spatially contained; they are old-fashioned for their day in having walls and also in their absence of strong axial organization. Garden designers adapted their schemes to existing topogra-<lb/>
phy and did not practice extensive regrading, as was the case in contemporary gardens elsewhere in <name type="place">Europe</name>. Their loggia terraces were built for viewing <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs from above, but otherwise they have no connection with the plan of the garden. Although backward-looking in these ways, the gardens that were built in <name type="place">Portugal</name> at this time are highly original. In their exuberant exploitation of the design oppor-<lb/>
tunities inherent in a regional commodity&#x2014;glazed tiles&#x2014;the Portuguese confidently forged their own distinctive landscape idiom.</p>

<p>By the eighteenth century, the Picturesque style had begun to establish a powerful counterinfluence to that of <name type="place">Versailles</name>. Aristocrats felt increasing financial con-<lb/>

<p>Although many notable gardens were produced by the fusion in the eighteenth century of the pre-<lb/>
dominant French influence with that of other tradi-<lb/>
tions, of even greater consequence was the more far-reaching and long-lasting effect of landscape design from this era on the planning of cities. Increasingly, as monarchical authority sought to glorify itself on a public scale, not just the royal demesne but the entire capital city became the focus of monumental urban-<lb/>
ism. The idea that cities could be planned according to Baroque and French seventeenth-century design principles was suited, moreover, to the rising tide of nationalism and the desire to find an urban form that was expressive of the power of the state.</p>

<div type="section">

<p>By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the appearance of cityscapes owed much to the lessons landscape design professionals had learned in the sev-<lb/>
enteenth century. Axial extension, <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> defined by ranks of trees, intersections marked with fountains or other central features, sculpture and monuments with programmatic content&#x2014;these are, as we have seen, the basic ingredients of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s garden style. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had conceived the plan for the town of <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name> as integral with that of the gardens of the palace, and <name type="pname">Margrave Karl Wilhelm</name> had treated town and park in a similar fashion at Karlsruhe (see fig. 6.16). But royal patronage was not strictly necessary for the further development of this style of urbanism. Throughout the seventeenth century, with the rise of the middle class, cities gained increasing autonomy and became more than court appendages, episcopal seats, or mere trading centers. National governments and municipal corporations employed architects, engineers, and artists to revise and extend their lay-<lb/>

moted state and civic pride.</p>
<p>The resulting form of urbanism, which has remained a valid paradigm for planners down to modern times, was thus concomitant with the growth of nation-states and the status of the city as an expression of the wealth and virtue of its citizenry. The premise of infinitely extensible axes that is cen-<lb/>
tral to this manner of design foreshadowed the dis-<lb/>
appearance of city walls as nations came into
<pb n="213"/>
<pb n="213" type="orig"/>
existence and city-states ceased to function as inde-<lb/>
pendent and autonomous political units. In addition, with the seventeenth-century technical invention of spring suspension and the introduction of plate-glass windows, carriage travel became a sociable pastime as well as a comparatively efficient means of loco-<lb/>
motion, and this fact had obvious consequences for the scale of streets and the design of cities.</p>

<p>The first step in the transformation from high-walled citadel to the modern city occurred when military engineers developed a new system of defense employing projecting bastions instead of battlements. With their "ears" and pointed triangular "demi-lunes," these strategic constructions were built to withstand cannon siege while allowing the defending artillery maximum protection as they fired back along a series of intersecting diagonal sight lines. In plan, they form starburst patterns. Like the gardens of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, they thrust outward, metaphorically invading space.<ref target="#CH6-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> As interior cities became increasingly secure behind chains of fort cities constructed along their frontiers, their fortifications began to be eliminated, and even the new bulwarks in time gave way to boulevards, tree-planted ring roads that attracted recreational activity, notably carriage driving and promenading, which in turn gave rise to nineteenth-century shop-<lb/>
ping and caf&#x00E9; life.</p>
<p>Military engineers such as <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s contem-<lb/>
porary <name type="pname">S&#x00E9;bastien Le Prestre de Vauban</name> (<date when="1633">1633</date>&#x2013;<date when="1707">1707</date>) were frequently called upon to lay out cities.<ref target="#CH6-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> Their plans demanded the abandonment of the "organic" approach to urbanism characteristic of many older cities and the subordination of everyday life to a con-<lb/>
ceptual order based on symbolical intent as well as practical considerations. Even where the perennially useful grid was employed, the underlying symbolism of the Baroque cityscape, which pressed Renaissance humanism into the service of proclaiming princely power, demanded its ruthless interruption by radials emanating like the rays of the sun from the court or seat of government. It is because of its indifference to the requirements of the daily lives of ordinary indi-<lb/>
viduals that urban historians&#x2014;<name type="pname">Lewis Mumford</name>, for one&#x2014;have judged this kind of authoritarian planning harshly. But its compensatory offering was theatri-<lb/>
cality and a new vision of the dignity of public space and public life in which a reciprocity of sight lines between civic institutions symbolically expressed the political and cultural aspirations of the society.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi> with its long vistas along the straight diagonals of the hunting park provided a new model for radial thoroughfares emanating from a cir-<lb/>
cle in a star pattern, facilitating both the movement of ordinary traffic and military troops in an emer-<lb/>
gency, while considerably increasing the dynamism and drama of city space. The tree-lined <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> found in French gardens provided a model for street tree planting. They are the progenitors not only of broad avenues for pleasant strolling, but also of tree-lined processional and parade routes like the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es in <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Avenue in <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington, D.C.</name> Embellished by obelisks, portals, arches, fountains, monuments, and sculptures that serve as place fixers for squares and circles that punctuate their length and provide a cadence to the movement along them, these ceremonial axes dramatize the city and articulate messages of civic pride and national power.</p>
<p>Urban squares were intentionally designed as stages for public life and heroic commemoration. Even without the foci of fountains and monuments, these architecturally conceived spaces conveyed a powerful sense of place and became elements of the imagery that gave each city its individual character in the minds of its citizens and visitors. In addition, the Baroque cityscape was one in which heights were dramatized; the lofty church or palace, the proud hill-<lb/>
top monument, the urban cascade, and the grand stairway provided urban distinction and sense of place.</p>
<p>The Baroque cityscape married the apprecia-<lb/>
tion of real and symbolic order characteristic of French classicism to the instinct for dramatic siting and theatrical effects found in Italian landscape design. The combined genius of <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>, <name type="pname">Bernini</name>, and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> helped shape a new urban form that inspired plans for the layout of cities on a grand scale suitable to new modes of transportation. More orderly than any plans since the days of the Roman Empire, these also envisioned new standards of public sanitation and safety as well as new standards of public recre-<lb/>
ation and entertainment.</p>

<p>In Bernini, <name type="place">Rome</name> had a sculptor capable of aggrandizing the urban plan of <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> which we examined in Chapter Four. He brought to the secular imagery of the city's public spaces the same powers of dramatic composition one finds in his commissions for the Counter-Reformation Church. In addition to remodeling the <name type="pname">Acqua Vergine Antica</name>,<ref target="#CH6-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> he created two fountains at the Piazza Barberini&#x2014;the Fountain of the Triton and the Fountain of the Bees from the Barberini pope's coat of arms (fig. 6.36). His master-<lb/>
piece stands at the center of the Piazza Navona: the Fountain of the Four Rivers, with its four symbolic river gods. These figures are not self-contained and lan-<lb/>
guidly at rest like the river gods of antiquity, but actively twist and gesture like actors in a dramatic tableau.</p>
<p>From today's vantage point, it is sometimes dif-<lb/>
ficult to remember that even with the construction of new streets and significant works of architecture, seventeenth-century cities were far more rural in char-<lb/>
acter than ours. Though some streets were paved, many were not, and we see with surprise in seven-<lb/>
teenth- and eighteenth-century prints of <name type="place">Rome</name> the still-rough, undressed character of the surrounding ground plane and the quasi-rustic character of the public life within the spaces that envelop these archi-<lb/>
tectural and sculptural masterpieces. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, <name type="place">Rome</name> was the most sophisticated and urbane city in the West-<lb/>
ern world. With its numerous ruins as testaments of its historical greatness, it was a place in which one felt the poetics of the collapsed centuries. Added to this was the festive air of papal pomp and worldly pleas-<lb/>
ure made manifest in stone. These provided ample basis for <name type="place">Rome</name>'s growing international reputation as a place of unrivaled wonders.</p>
<p>With its new fountains and treasure trove of ancient artifacts ready-made for urban scenography, <name type="place">Rome</name> provided a vocabulary of forms for cityscapes elsewhere. It also initiated the characteristically Baroque concept of dynamic movement through space, an idea that had its roots in the Mannerists' con-<lb/>
cern with perspective and that now made a sensual experience of the eye's journey through space. Baroque spatial organization was not merely hori-<lb/>
zontal; the architectural embellishment of heights with buildings, monuments, and grand stairs of ascent gave a vertical dimension to movement. The animated movement of water rising and falling into Roman fountains and, in addition, the gestural sculp-<lb/>
ture that ornamented them added further spatial drama to the urban scene.</p>
<p>Essentially plastic in their formal orientation and theatrical in their approach, Roman designers devel-<lb/>
oped an urbanism that thrived on incident, creating a street network of interrelated points of interest rather than, as in <name type="place">France</name>, an exploration of the possi-<lb/>
bilities of space for its own sake. Roman urbanism contained a celebratory message, one that sought to dazzle the senses and awe the mind with the reaf-<lb/>
firmed glory of the Catholic Church and the resur-<lb/>
rected splendor of the imperial past. French urbanists, on the other hand, with less emotional exuberance, greater reliance on intellect and reason, and a gift for centralized administration, dramatized the power of the modern state. The manifestation of this power in an overall plan for <name type="place">Paris</name> in which <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s seem-<lb/>
ingly infinite axes were applied on a civic scale would, given <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s preoccupation with <name type="place">Versailles</name>, nec-<lb/>
essarily await a later age, that of <name type="pname">Napoleon III</name> in the nineteenth century (see Chapter Ten). As we saw in Chapter Four, the groundwork for that urbanistic feat had already been laid even before the time of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> in the series of projects undertaken in <name type="place">Paris</name> during the rule of <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> at the dawn of the seventeenth century.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="place">Paris</name> After <name type="pname">Henry IV</name></hi></head>
<p>In <name type="place">Paris</name>, as in <name type="place">Italy</name>, the invention of the spring-sus-<lb/>
pension carriage had made straight avenue circulation a new priority in urban design. In <date when="1616">1616</date>, in imitation of the Corso on the outskirts of her native Florence, <name type="pname">Henry IV</name>'s widow, Marie de M&#x00E9;dicis, had the Cours-<lb/>
la-Reine laid out for carriage promenaders on the out-<lb/>
skirts of the city along the banks of the Seine to the west of the Tuileries (fig. 6.37). Quadruple rows of elms created three avenues almost a mile in length, bringing not only the amenity of the tree-lined street to <name type="place">Paris</name>, but also the socialization of urban space. Peo-<lb/>
ple had discovered, along with the visual and physical enjoyment of movement itself, the theatrical possi-<lb/>
<pb n="215"/>
<pb n="215" type="orig"/>
bilities of street life with its daily spectacle of carriages and promenaders. Bewigged and dressed in silks and lace, the socially ambitious saw themselves as pro-<lb/>
tagonists in the diurnal drama of meeting and greet-<lb/>
ing one another in public. The Cours-la-Reine was soon thronged with carriages, one more opulently appointed than the next, and its popularity was so great that on the opposite side of town the <name type="pname">Cours St.-<lb/>
Antoine</name> was inaugurated on the rue <name type="pname">St.-Antoine</name>, the main ceremonial entry to <name type="place">Paris</name> from the east along the road from Vincennes. Here the trees were planted to form twin all&#x00E9;es for promenading with a broad car-<lb/>
riage drive in between. To extend it eastward, the Cours de Vincennes was built in the <date when="1660">1660</date>s.</p>
<p>The most important <hi rend="italic">cours</hi> of all was that initi-<lb/>
ated by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> around <date when="1670">1670</date> when the axis of the Tuileries, called the Grand Cours, was extended approximately a mile into the open countryside to the &#x00C9;toile, as the <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi> with its starburst of radiating avenues is called. Between this axis and the Cours-la-<lb/>
Reine beside the Seine, royal gardeners planted a stretch of ground as a quincunx&#x2014;a regular arrange-<lb/>
ment of trees set in a pattern composed of multiple units of five, in which four trees comprise the angles of a square or rectangle, while the fifth serves to mark its center. The poetic name for this grove was Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, meaning the Elysian Fields. Another short axis connected the Cours-la-Reine with the wide, tree-<lb/>
bordered carriage drive and promenade of the Grand Cours. Today the Grand Cours bears the name of the old grove beside it and is known as the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es. Since <name type="pname">Napoleon</name> located his Arc de Triomphe in the center of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s &#x00C9;toile, <name type="place">Paris</name> has effectively faced west instead of east toward Vincennes, and while the recreational nature of the Grand Cours still lingers in the recently restored promenades and caf&#x00E9;s lining the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, the route has also served for the last two hundred years as the city's principal ceremonial thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Under <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, military engineers began con-<lb/>
struction of a new system of <hi rend="italic">boulevarts</hi> (bastions), and from the beginning these were designed to form a green girdle of wide tree-lined carriage drives and promenades, the forerunner of the circumferential modern boulevards built at grade level when the <hi rend="italic">boulevart</hi> walls were at last removed. Since the con-<lb/>
struction of these new bastions stretched well into the eighteenth century, it became increasingly appar-<lb/>
ent that even their modest pretence at defense was both useless and unnecessary, and the city began to spread freely, incorporating into itself the surround-<lb/>
ing <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi>. Moreover, it probably became apparent to government authorities that, although they served as a convenient customs barrier and a good lookout for patrolling sentinels posted to keep the peace, the walls might even assist rebellion and mob usurpation of power within <name type="place">Paris</name> if a revolutionary force gained control of them. Thus the primary function of the boulevards, or <hi rend="italic">remparts</hi>, as they continued to be called, was one of recreational circulation, and cafes and other places of entertainment eventually sprang up along the more frequented ones such as the popular Boulevard du Nord.</p>

<p>One can only imagine what <name type="place">Paris</name> might have looked like today had <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> chosen to follow <name type="pname">Col-<lb/>
bert</name>'s advice and made it his capital. Since the king visited the city only four times during the last twenty-<lb/>
two years of his life, it is understandable that <name type="place">Paris</name> received but two new squares during his reign: the Place des Victoires (<date when="1682">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687">87</date>) and the Place <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> (<date when="1699">1699</date>, today the Place Vend&#x00F4;me). Both were built by <name type="pname">Jules Hardouin-Mansart</name>, the court architect, as squares defined by uniform architectural facades, spaces in which to place a statue of the king. Of greater consequence to the welfare of the city's pop-<lb/>
ulation, <name type="pname">Colbert</name> had fifteen new public fountains built and torch lamps installed for nighttime illumination. Nevertheless, not having the king's firm backing for comprehensive urban planning, he left <name type="place">Paris</name> a city bet-<lb/>
ter known abroad for its offal-filled streets than for this modicum of public health and security or its iso-<lb/>
lated architectural gems and new rampart boulevards.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Louis XV</name> (<date when="1710">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1774">1774</date>) left his mark on eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century <name type="place">Paris</name> with the construction of several squares, of which the most notable is the Place <name type="pname">Louis XV</name> renamed the Place de la Concorde (<date when="1763">1763</date>). Located at the junction of the Tuileries axis with that of the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, it was designed by <name type="pname">Jacques-Ange Gabriel</name> (<date when="1698">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782">1782</date>) with eight stone pavilions repre-<lb/>
senting the provincial capitals of <name type="place">France</name>. These framed the square; its centerpiece was a bronze sculp-<lb/>
ture of the king. Because of its prominence and asso-<lb/>
<pb n="216"/>
<pb n="216" type="orig"/>
ciation with royalty, it became the site of many guil-<lb/>
lotine executions during the Rev-<lb/>
olution, including that of <name type="pname">Louis XVI</name> (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">1792</date>). To replace the central sculpture which had been destroyed during the Rev-<lb/>
olution, the Obelisk of Luxor, commemorating the deeds of <name type="pname">Ramesses II</name> and originally located in front of the Temple of Thebes in <name type="place">Upper Egypt</name>, was pre-<lb/>
sented by the viceroy of <name type="place">Egypt</name>, <name type="pname">Muhammad &#x00C1;li</name>, to the French king <name type="pname">Louis-Philippe</name> (ruled <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>) in <date when="1831">1831</date>. This valued gift enabled <name type="place">Paris</name> to follow the example set by <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> in <name type="place">Rome</name> by establishing an Egyptian obelisk as the focus of an important urban square (fig. 6.38; see fig. 4.38).</p>

<p>The fixity of human settlement is such that, unless a powerful authoritarian will can exert control, patterns of land occupancy generally resist radical alteration. Even when opportunities to rebuild anew arise after such calamities as war and fire, in their efforts to re-<lb/>
establish property ownership and a sense of histori-<lb/>
cal continuity and place, people prefer old circulation patterns and building lot configurations to new ones, although the new ones may be considerably more convenient and attractive. In such dire circumstances, people become instinctive preservationists. The urbanistic history of seventeenth-century <name type="place">London</name> proves the point.</p>
<p><name type="place">London</name>'s disastrous fire of <date when="1666">1666</date> destroyed almost 400 acres within its walls and an additional 60 outside, leaving a huge semicircle of smoldering ruins. In addition to eighty-seven parish churches and many other public buildings including those housing the entire financial and mercantile districts, 13,200 houses went up in flames leaving nearly a quarter million people homeless.<ref target="#CH6-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref> While this was a disaster of greater magnitude than the historic loss of the Vesuvian cities in 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> because of <name type="place">London</name>'s larger population, it also provided an opportunity to rebuild the urban core and its surrounding precincts. Following the fire, <name type="pname">Christopher Wren</name>, <name type="pname">John Evelyn</name>, and others presented plans that incorporated the lessons of both <name type="place">Versailles</name> and <name type="place">Rome</name>. But these were soon shelved, and <name type="place">London</name> rebuilt itself not according to a grand plan, but piece-<lb/>
meal over the next fifty years along the lines of its old streets and lanes.</p>
<p>The walls of <name type="place">London</name>, like those of <name type="place">Paris</name>, grad-<lb/>
ually fell into disuse, and, with the city's continued res-<lb/>
idential growth as its population climbed to overtake that of any European city, a number of residential squares were laid out by developers. In Westminster and the West End, as well as in Bloomsbury east of those areas, leaseholds to great mansions and their gardens were sold to building developers, but the landowners' names and titles were commemorated in the new streets and squares that took their place. The notion of the symmetrical planned square with architecturally unified building facades and a ground-<lb/>
floor arcade had been borrowed from <name type="place">Italy</name> by <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name> (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652">1652</date>) when he built Covent Garden as a speculation for the fourth earl of Bedford in <date when="1639">1639</date> (fig. 6.39). Specifically, the great neo-Palladian architect had modeled his plan for Covent Garden on that of the Piazza d'Arme built by the Medici dukes in the fortress and port town of Livorno at the end of the sixteenth century, a symmetrical square of arcaded buildings (fig. 6.40).<ref target="#CH6-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> Initially an address for the well-born, Covent Garden became a market square in <date when="1671">1671</date> and,
<pb n="217"/>
<pb n="217" type="orig"/>
with the licensing of the nearby <name type="pname">Drury Lane Theater</name>, the nucleus of the performing arts district that flour-<lb/>
ished there in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>At the same time that Covent Garden Piazza (as it was first called) was being built, the layout of another group of speculative houses around <name type="pname">Lincoln'</name>s Inn Fields was under way. In the early <date when="1660">1660</date>s at Bloomsbury Square, the fourth earl of Southampton set the pattern of residential development that became common in <name type="place">London</name> after the Great Fire as land-owning aristocrats realized the profits to be made by turning landlord. Bloomsbury Square lots varied in size, and leases specified only that houses be reasonably large and of a suitably dignified character. From this point forward, the squares of <name type="place">London</name> assumed a more heterogeneous, less authoritarian appearance than their Continental counterparts. They were greener, too, for, whereas Parisian squares had been planned as public spaces, in <name type="place">London</name>, where there was no tradition of their public use as promenades or arenas for spectacles, they were often designed as fenced and locked gardens, with keys provided only to those whose houses fronted upon them. This dif-<lb/>
ference between the squares of <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name type="place">London</name> was perpetuated in the nineteenth century when <name type="pname">Baron Haussmann</name>, <name type="pname">Louis-Napol&#x00E9;on</name>'s Prefect of the Seine, built several new ones as landscaped islands within <name type="place">Paris</name>'s improved circulation system, whereas those of <name type="place">London</name> continued to be planted as quasi-private gar-<lb/>
dens for adjacent residents.</p>
<p>In the busy building years following the Great Fire, many of the <name type="place">London</name> squares that today con-<lb/>
tribute greatly to the city's green and pleasant char-<lb/>
acter took shape. With the development of elegant Grosvenor Square between <date when="1725">1725</date> and <date when="1731">1731</date>, <name type="place">London</name>'s largest square with the exception of <name type="pname">Lincoln</name>'s Inn Fields, Mayfair became the district of choice for many titled people (fig. 6.41). On the neighboring estate to the east, <name type="place">Berkeley</name> Square continued the now-familiar pattern of Georgian town houses facing a common green. With the exception of Covent Garden, which early assumed its character as a public space, most of these greens remained discreetly sequestered behind iron palings and off limits to passersby. It was not until <date when="1832">1832</date> with the creation of Trafalgar Square, where ten years later the naval victory of <name type="pname">Lord Nelson</name> was memorialized with a 145-foot- (44-meter-) high col-<lb/>
umn, that <name type="place">London</name> received a nonresidential public square and urban landmark similar in spirit to the piazzas of <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>

<p>Seventeenth-century <name type="place">London</name> offered other places in which the gregarious could congregate. The same cultural forces that were at work in <name type="place">Paris</name> and else-<lb/>
where were at work in <name type="place">London</name>, too, creating a new element of the population attached to the court yet flourishing with growing independence from it. With increased wealth derived from manufacturing and trade and the first wave of riches from overseas colonies, "society" had come into being. The growth of cities during this period was accompanied by a change in their character. They no longer functioned simply as fortified centers of production, exchange, and religious celebration. Cities in the seventeenth century, especially capital cities like <name type="place">London</name> and <name type="place">Paris</name>, became places of pleasure and, to a greater degree than was true of cities since antiquity, places where ideas as well as goods were traded, the wombs of intellectual discovery and ideology. The need of the new leisure class for entertainment as well as for intel-<lb/>
lectual and social stimulation brought into being new urban forms: the coffeehouse and its French variant the caf&#x00E9;, as well as the theater and the promenade.</p>

tise marriageability (or availability if one was a cour-<lb/>
tesan)&#x2014;for these and other reasons one needed a public sphere, a defined space where, with predictable regularity, one could be sure of meeting and greeting one's own kind. The promenade, or the parade as it was also called, served this function. In the same way that boulevards came to lose their association with fortifications and began to be built independent of the location of former city walls, malls for prome-<lb/>
nading&#x2014;the descendants of the once-popular game of pall-mall, which originated in <name type="place">Italy</name>&#x2014;became urban features in their own right. <name type="pname">Samuel Pepys</name>'s diary brings the public life of all these sociable public spaces vividly to life, coloring in their outlines with con-<lb/>
temporary observation and anecdotal detail. Pepys and his fellow government servants, together with all elements of society could be seen parading whenever the weather was fine in <name type="pname">St. James</name>'s Park along <name type="pname">Charles II</name>'s pall-mall alley, which was surfaced with well-<lb/>
watered pulverized cockleshells. Nearby the king built <name type="pname">Catherine</name> Street, named for the queen. It soon assumed its popular name, Pall Mall, as it has been known ever since (fig. 6.42).</p>
<p>Although the royal parks belonged to the crown, it was customary by the seventeenth century for royalty to share them with the public. In Green Park, <name type="pname">Charles II</name> enjoyed fraternizing with his subjects as he took his daily stroll along Constitution Hill, as the broad walk at the southern end of the park is still called. In the eighteenth century, Queen Caroline, the wife of <name type="pname">George II</name>, had the Queen's Walk built along its less public eastern border, for by that time the park had become crowded with Londoners enjoying them-<lb/>
selves as they strolled along its crisscrossing web of gravel paths set amid green grass. During its long his-<lb/>
tory as an urban public space, Green Park also served as a place for military parades, public celebrations, duels, and in the nineteenth century, numerous hot-<lb/>
air balloon ascents.</p>
<p>Long popular as the scene of May Day celebra-<lb/>
tions, Hyde Park, which had been sold by Parliament in the time of <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>, was repossessed in <date when="1660">1660</date> by <name type="pname">Charles II</name> and turned into a resort of fashion (fig. 6.43). The park was enclosed by a brick wall and the Ring, first called the Tour, was laid out by the king as a carriage promenade for the <hi rend="italic">beau monde</hi>. <name type="pname">Rotten Row</name>, a corruption of <hi rend="italic">route du roi</hi>, the link between Ken-<lb/>
sington and <name type="pname">St. James</name>'s Palaces, became the first illu-<lb/>
minated thoroughfare in <name type="place">England</name> when <name type="pname">William III</name> ascended the throne and, upon taking up residence in Kensington Palace, had some 300 lamps installed in the branches of the trees along its borders as a deterrent to the highwaymen who threatened night-<lb/>
time security.</p>
<p>Like the gardens of Buckingham Palace today, Kensington Gardens was in the beginning reserved for the private enjoyment of the king and queen. <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> had the gardens laid out in the Dutch fashion by <name type="pname">Henry Wise</name> (<date when="1653">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) and <name type="pname">George London</name> (d. <date when="1714">1714</date>). Considerably altered by <name type="pname">Queen Anne</name>, they were not opened to the public until <name type="pname">George II</name> permitted "respectably dressed people" to frequent them on Saturdays. By granting this per-<lb/>
mission he turned the Broad Walk into a fashionable promenade running from north to south in front of the palace.</p>
<p><name type="place">London</name>, then, was throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a city growing piecemeal, district by district, as the properties of several noble families who had the good fortune to own land were turned into profitable real-estate speculations. It there-<lb/>
fore had no sense of overall order based upon a com-<lb/>
prehensive plan. Its character is limned by historical circumstance rather than by a grand design. As will become apparent from an examination of the history of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, bold urban design visions stand a greater chance of realization where there is no pre-<lb/>
existing urban fabric and where there is sufficient cen-<lb/>
tralized authority to ensure their construction in accordance with a master plan.</p>

<p>If <name type="place">London</name> provides an early example of laissez-faire capitalism as one of the driving forces of city develop-<lb/>
ment, <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> provides its opposite: an autocratic city created by fiat and planned entirely by government decree. The story of its founding is legendary.</p>
<p>We may imagine <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name>, the imperi-<lb/>
ous autocrat portayed in &#x00C9;tienne Maurice Falconet's bronze equestrian sculpture and Pushkin's sinister poem <hi rend="italic">The Bronze Horseman</hi>, bestriding the banks of the Neva, commanding the waves to subside and an army of conscripted serfs to implement his vision of a mighty Baltic port, <name type="place">Russia</name>'s "window to the West." The historic decision was made in <date when="1703">1703</date> after his return from Holland and <name type="place">England</name> where, traveling incognito, he had worked as a ship's carpenter and studied shipbuilding at the Royal Navy's impressive modern dockyard at Deptford. Determined to recon-<lb/>
quer the Baltic provinces that had been lost to <name type="place">Swe-<lb/>
den</name>, he set about building the Fortress of <name type="pname">St. Peter</name> and <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> on an island at the mouth of the river. Here the Neva&#x2014;named for its chief characteristic, mud&#x2014;had formed a swampy delta. Its branches had created a series of islands that, together with the mainland on the left bank, became the site of the future capital. Only the mightiest act of will bolstered by supreme authority and supported by the callous consumption of virtually unlimited human resources could have turned this desolate northern outpost on a remote fringe of <name type="place">Russia</name>, occupied by only a few rude cottages of Finnish fishermen, into one of the world's most beautiful cities.<ref target="#CH6-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Peter's victory over the Swedes at Poltava in <date when="1709">1709</date> provided the necessary security for him to move the Russian capital from <name type="place">Moscow</name> to <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>. In spite of uncontrolled periodic disastrous flooding, fires, and wolves roaming the streets, it was soon the home of the imperial family, and a decree of <date when="1716">1716</date> enjoined a hundred noble families to also take up res-<lb/>
idence in these Baltic wilds. Another edict that year conscripted 40,000 workers from the provinces. All stone construction was forbidden in <name type="place">Moscow</name> in order to channel both masons and that scarce building material into <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>. Personally indifferent to luxury, Peter nevertheless imposed building regula-<lb/>
tions that dictated a standard of grandeur for the palaces that his reluctantly relocated nobles were forced to build.</p>
<p>The appearance of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> was to be unequivocally Western. In <date when="1703">1703</date>, Peter appointed the Italian architect <name type="pname">Domenico Trezzini</name> (<date when="1670">1670</date>&#x2013;<date when="1734">1734</date>) as his first Master of Building, Construction, and Fortifica-<lb/>
tion. After <date when="1713">1713</date>, Trezzini was succeeded by the Ger-<lb/>
man Andreas Schl&#x00FC;ter (c. <date when="1659">1659</date>&#x2013;<date when="1714">1714</date>), who brought in his train several younger architects. These young men were able to provide the talent necessary to keep up the frantic pace of building after Schl&#x00FC;ter's death the following year. In <date when="1716">1716</date>, <name type="pname">Alexandre Le Blond</name> signed a contract to serve as architect general of <name type="place">St. Peters-<lb/>
burg</name> for five years. To carry out his designs he brought with him several skilled artisans and workmen.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-265">
<graphic url="CH6_047.jpg"/>
<figDesc>6.44. Plan of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name></figDesc>
</figure>
<p><name type="pname">Le Blond</name> laid out the Nevsky Prospekt, the northern arm of what was to become three radial avenues focused on the Admiralty, which was topped with a 235-foot- (71.6-meter-) tall spire that, like a mag-<lb/>
net, drew the city toward its symbolic and actual <hi rend="italic">rai-<lb/>
son d'&#x00EA;tre</hi>, the great docking facility beside the swift-flowing Neva (fig. 6.44). Stretching for 2.75 miles southeast, the Nevsky Prospekt crossed the Moika River and the Katherine and Fontanka Canals before bending and narrowing somewhat as it continued toward its conclusion at the <name type="pname">Alexander Nevsky Monastery</name> At first it was simply a 115-foot- (35-meter-) wide, straight, stone-paved avenue lined with trees. Then, in the nineteenth century, it was developed into an arcaded shopping street offering English, French, and German luxury goods.</p>
<p>In building <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> had envisioned not only a city with the grandeur of <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name>, but one also reminiscent of <name type="place">Amsterdam</name>, another great commercial port. He had especially admired the Dutch city's new series of concentric canals bordered by tree-lined promenades and unbro-<lb/>
ken rows of town houses, and he had left orders in <date when="1716">1716</date> that, while he was away with the army, a similar
<pb n="220"/>
<pb n="220" type="orig"/>
series of canals was to be laid out on Vasilevsky Island. Upon his return two years later he found that the canals were too small to be navigable. They were therefore filled in, and this part of the city acquired instead a uniform grid of streets.</p>
<p>As <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> became more cosmopolitan, the aristocracy no longer came reluctantly, but gladly forsook their estates for this northern capital with its whirl of social life centered upon the court and the imperial family. A number of Italian architects were commissioned to work alongside the Russian archi-<lb/>
tects to build palaces and otherwise embellish the city. <name type="pname">Bartolomeo Rastrelli</name> designed the Winter Palace, now part of the Hermitage Museum, and several other grandiose structures in the Rococo style. Later in the century, under <name type="pname">Catherine</name> the Great, the Neoclassicism associated with the French Enlightenment prevailed over this more flamboyant architectural idiom.</p>
<p>In her inaugural year of <date when="1762">1762</date>, <name type="pname">Catherine the Great</name>, extolled for having found a city of wood and left one of stone, formed the Commission for the Masonry Construction of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>. In keeping with the forceful role of government in controlling the development of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, rules were codi-<lb/>
fied to ensure architectural conformity of building heights and facades.</p>
<p>The elegance of the Russian capital under <name type="pname">Catherine the Great</name> lay in the ordered grandeur that resulted from these controls as well as in the city's wide modern streets. It was also apparent in a host of decorative details: wrought-iron grilles and gates, rail-<lb/>
ings and lampposts, trees and statues. Under <name type="pname">Czars Alexander I</name> and <name type="pname">Nicholas I</name>, the talented architect <name type="pname">Carlo Rossi</name> (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>) built Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace, one of the world's largest squares and most impressive public spaces (fig. 6.45). Defined by the curving arms of his General Staff Building, which forms a hemicycle on its southern side, the square is given a central focus by the 154-<lb/>
foot- (47-meter-) tall <name type="pname">Alexander Column</name> of polished red Finnish granite, believed to be the largest single stone ever cut.</p>

<p>By the nineteenth century, <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> had become a pleasure capital for the rich. With its uni-<lb/>
versity and Academies of Arts and Sciences, its daily spectacle of carriages and shoppers along Nevsky Prospekt, its theaters and ballet, its German private schools and French restaurants, it was, for those who could afford it, an extremely agreeable and cosmo-<lb/>
politan milieu. Although no one was more aware of the repressive terror that undergirded the city darkly, the poet <name type="pname">Alexander Pushkin</name> (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>) gave delight-<lb/>
ed voice to its violent gaiety, its regimented design, and its military spectacle in <hi rend="italic">The Bronze Horseman</hi>.</p>
<p>The masters of the modern socialist state who succeeded the czars who built <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> found its grand design congenial. The heroic scale of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>'s streets and squares, the regimentation of its architecture, the iconography of power con-<lb/>
veyed by its public sculpture&#x2014;all these brilliantly served as the model that <name type="place">Russia</name>'s twentieth-century Communist rulers appropriated in the planning of <name type="place">Moscow</name> and other cities where they wished to pro-<lb/>
claim both doctrinaire political authority and a con-<lb/>
servative modernity.</p>
<p>By contrast, monumental planning in a sym-<lb/>
bolic sense held small appeal to the shapers of a dem-<lb/>
ocratic country whose fundamental goal was the pursuit of immediate wealth through free enterprise. The opportunities inherent in a seemingly limit-<lb/>
less supply of land and the hardships attendant upon occupying it were such that practicality, not pomp, was the order of the day in colonial <name type="place">America</name>. Only when freedom from British rule was achieved did the founders of the new United States, supported in their aesthetic ideals by the presence in their country of French allies following the war for independence, commission an architect from <name type="place">France</name>, Pierre L'En-<lb/>
fant, to prepare a plan for its new capital of <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington, D.C.</name> (see fig. 6.54). As we shall see, this initial exercise in American urban grandeur was confined to this one city and was only fully realized in the twen-<lb/>
tieth century. For the most part the serviceable grid employed by Spanish colonial settlers proved of equal merit to the British, whose cities became the models for the western expansion of the United States of <name type="place">America</name> after independence was achieved.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">III. Nature's Paradise: <name type="place">America</name> in the Colonial and Federal Periods</hi></head>
<p>The European arrival in <name type="place">America</name> had profound con-<lb/>
sequences for landscape design. Sixteenth- and sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century explorers and colonists, whose motives were primarily economic, sought wealth in the form of ore, minerals, timber, and other natural resources. In appropriating a new continent, they had scant regard for the customs, ritual centers, and atti-<lb/>
tudes toward nature of the native occupants, the traces of whose presence within the landscape were by and large effaced. Spanish, Dutch, French, and Eng-<lb/>
lish traders and settlers came, some to build towns and farm the land, others to convert souls, trap ani-<lb/>
mals, or mine gold and silver. Although all of these European cultures left their mark, the two principal ones to imprint the American landscape in design terms were the Spanish and the English.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Spanish Colonial Settlements</hi></head>
<p>The first European power to establish settlements in the Americas, <name type="place">Spain</name> began its colonizing activities immediately following <name type="pname">Christopher Columbus</name>'s momentous discovery. At first, when it was still believed that Columbus's landfall had occurred in the Indies, government-sponsored expeditions were moti-<lb/>
vated purely by the desire for trade and the appro-<lb/>
priation of riches. But the dimensions and natural resources of a vast continent gradually revealed them-<lb/>
selves. By <date when="1550">1550</date>, Spanish explorers had ventured from Cuba north to the peninsula they named <name type="place">La Florida</name>, continuing west as far as present-day <name type="place">Arkansas</name> and north along the eastern seaboard of what is now the United States. At the same time, adventurers depart-<lb/>
ing from <name type="place">Mexico City</name> traveled overland into the arid lands that became <name type="place">Texas</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, and <name type="place">Arizona</name> and by sea up the Pacific coast to the more verdant region that is now <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place">Oregon</name>. Tales of mythical cities and magical places like the Fountain of Youth and Diamond Mountain were discredited one by one, and by the first decade of the sixteenth century, it was clear that if wealth was to be gained, <name type="place">Spain</name> would have to subjugate this vast territory and build an empire based not on fabulous finds, but rather on the hard work of farming, ranching, and mining. Laying claim to the entire North American continent, <name type="place">Spain</name> began its colonization efforts.</p>
<p>The Spanish strategy of conquest was based upon three distinct types of settlement: the mission; the military <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>, or fort; and the civilian <hi rend="italic">pueblo or villa</hi>, as towns were variously called depending upon their size and importance. The missionary spear-<lb/>
headed the campaign to convert native peoples to Catholicism and Spanish cultural mores. The soldier manned the <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi> and served as the initial secular intermediary with native peoples, protecting the mis-<lb/>
sion and settlement from hostile invasion while estab-<lb/>
lishing contacts with friendly tribes. The colonist came in their wake, building the <hi rend="italic">pueblo</hi>, establishing civil law, and developing the regional economy.</p>
<p>The Spanish government issued explicit instruc-<lb/>
tions for the layout of these new towns, at first on a case-by-case basis. As settlements multiplied, how-<lb/>
ever, colonial administrators found it necessary to cod-<lb/>
ify their planning prescriptions in a royal ordinance called the <hi rend="italic">Recopilaci&#x00F3;n de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, which <name type="pname">Philip II</name> promulgated in <date when="1573">1573</date>. Pragmatic in its objectives and designed to create a simple paradigm that could be easily followed by architecturally inexperienced men in remote lands, the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi> ignored the innovative urban schemes of contemporary late Renaissance planners, opting instead for the ancient Roman formula for mil-<lb/>
itary encampments and new towns as set forth by <name type="pname">Vit-<lb/>
ruvius</name> around 30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and summarized by <name type="pname">Alberti</name> in his fifteenth-century treatise <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>. In this way, the orthogonal streets and central forum of the ancient colonial city became the plaza-centered grid settlement of <name type="place">Spanish America</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>After the colonists had selected an appropriately healthful site and performed the required rituals&#x2014;usually the saying of mass&#x2014;they marked off a rec-<lb/>
tangular area for the town and built the protective <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>. Their next task was to construct a water sup-<lb/>
ply and irrigation system and to lay out and allot fields outside the town. Then they began filling in its out-<lb/>
lines, first reserving a central space for a plaza of rec-<lb/>
tangular proportions, its recommended length, according to the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi>, being at least one and a half times its width inasmuch as "this proportion is the best for festivals in which horses are used." Whereas, as dis-<lb/>
cussed in Chapter One, the plazas of the Native Amer-<lb/>
ican pueblos were cosmologically aligned according to religious custom with each side facing one of the cardinal directions, Spanish colonial plazas had each corner pointing in a cardinal direction because the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> proclaimed that this prevented undue exposure "to the four principal winds." Four main thorough-<lb/>
fares ran from the middle of each side of the plaza across the length and breadth of the town, and the borders of the plaza were defined by secondary streets. The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> directed that other streets be laid out "con-<lb/>
secutively around the plaza." This injunction almost invariably resulted in a checkerboard or grid pattern. This grid layout was useful for parceling real estate among the settlers of the <hi rend="italic">pueblo</hi>. At the same time, it
<pb n="222"/>
<pb n="222" type="orig"/>
asserted symbolically the authority of the crown over both the settlers and the native population.</p>
<p>Building lots around the plaza were reserved for administrative and other public purposes as well as for shops and dwellings for merchants. The remaining lots in this location were to be distributed by lottery, and the crown held those not distributed for future allocation. It was recommended that the main church be freestanding, sited in an elevated location, and fur-<lb/>
nished with its own adjacent plaza. The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> further enjoined those responsible for laying out the town to reserve outside the palisade a common large enough so that if the town grew "there would always be suf-<lb/>
ficient space for its inhabitants to find recreation and for cattle to pasture without encroaching upon pri-<lb/>
vate property."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> instructed town planners to give the plaza and the four main streets diverging from it arcades "for these are a great convenience for those who resort thither for trade." In <name type="place">Santa Fe</name>, <name type="place">New Mex-<lb/>
ico</name>, and in other Spanish colonial settlements one may still find sidewalks around the plaza sheltered by <hi rend="italic">por-<lb/>
tales</hi>, or porticoes, more rustic in character but nev-<lb/>
ertheless derived from those found along the principal thoroughfares of ancient Roman and Renaissance cities (see fig. 6.40). These <hi rend="italic">portales</hi> sometimes exten-<lb/>
ded along the four principal streets as well as along the eight streets running from the corners of the plaza. If the town planners followed the injunction set forth in the colonial ordinance, the <hi rend="italic">portales</hi> at the corner streets would not obstruct the street crossing, being arranged so that "the sidewalks of the street can evenly join those of the plaza." Particularly after native uprisings made their overseers wary, settlers were directed to fortify the houses around the plaza.</p>
<p>In practice, there were deviations from the rules for town planning set forth in <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, but their intentions were honored widely throughout <name type="place">Spain</name>'s two hundred years of North American colo-<lb/>
nization. The Spanish "old towns" of several con-<lb/>
temporary cities reflect this heritage, later emphasized by the neo-Spanish-Colonial architecture of many buildings in southern <name type="place">California</name> and throughout the American Southwest. Thus we find at the beginning of the eighteenth century, when new forms of plan-<lb/>
ning inspired by French practice and Italian precedents were changing the appearance of European cities, that such <hi rend="italic">pueblos</hi> as <name type="place">San Antonio</name>, <name type="place">Texas</name>; <name type="place">Santa Fe</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>; and <name type="place">Los Angeles</name>, <name type="place">California</name>, were being laid out as grid cities with a central plaza.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">British Colonial Settlements</hi></head>
<p><name type="place">England</name>'s two first American settlements&#x2014;Jamestown, <name type="place">Virginia</name> (<date when="1607">1607</date>), and <name type="place">Plymouth</name>, <name type="place">Massa-<lb/>
chusetts</name> (<date when="1620">1620</date>)&#x2014;were laid out in a regular fashion as fortified villages within palisaded enclosures. Because of the extreme hardships their settlers endured in inhospitable locations, these villages did not develop into significant towns, much less cities. The colonial governors&#x2014;or the proprietors in the case of the townships of <name type="place">New England</name>&#x2014;who laid out subse-<lb/>
quent settlements acquired land-planning experience that enabled their communities to succeed better. This planning occurred on a regional scale inasmuch as lands granted by crown charter were distributed to colonists in the form of nucleated farming com-<lb/>
munities resembling European villages where farm-<lb/>
ers lived and went into the surrounding countryside to tend their fields.</p>
<p>However, in a land-rich country occupied by independent-minded people already of a migratory disposition, decentralizing forces were immediately at work. Plantation owners who grew tobacco in <name type="place">Vir-<lb/>
ginia</name> and <name type="place">Maryland</name> succeeded in shipping it from their own wharves in spite of the protests of gover-<lb/>
nors who wanted to consolidate colonial trade in port towns; the crown proclamations designating locations for these would-be towns were more than once repealed under pressure. In <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, following the pacification of the native inhabitants and the fail-<lb/>
ure of the first efforts to perform the work of agri-<lb/>
culture and animal husbandry in common, <name type="pname">Governor William Bradford</name> (<date when="1590">1590</date>&#x2013;<date when="1657">1657</date>), the English Puritan who settled and guided the <name type="place">Plymouth Colony</name> for thirty years, found that in order to tend their stocks of cattle the colonists were taking up residence upon their "great lots," the outlying fields allocated to them. He lamented their desertion of "the town, in which they lived compactly until now," and feared that this population dispersal "will be the ruine of <name type="place">New-Eng-<lb/>
land</name>, at least of the Churches of God ther."<ref target="#CH6-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref></p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="place">New England</name> Townships</hi></head>
<p>In spite of <name type="pname">Bradford</name>'s fears, the settlement of the older parts of <name type="place">New England</name> by groups of proprietors who were tied to one another by common religious belief, kinship, and economic interest did result in a village-<lb/>
centered occupancy of the land unlike that of the scat-<lb/>
tered farmsteads that later became the dominant pattern as the American frontier moved west. For these reasons as well as for security and adherence to tradition, most early <name type="place">New England</name> settlers lived in dis-<lb/>
tinctively defined communities, even as some were dispersing because their agricultural domains and greater opportunities lay at a distance.</p>
<p>Today many of these villages and the towns that grew from them constitute a cherished part of the American landscape. They vary in form but fall roughly into three basic types: "linear" towns such as <name type="place">Salem</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>; compact "square and gridded"
<pb n="223"/>
<pb n="223" type="orig"/>
communities such as <name type="place">Cambridge</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, and <name type="place">New Haven</name>, <name type="place">Connecticut</name>; and "organic" settlements such as <name type="place">Exeter</name>, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>; <name type="place">Woodstock</name>, <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
mont</name>; and <name type="place">Boston</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>.</p>
<p>Historic <name type="place">Salem</name>, or its Indian place name, Nehum-kek, by which it was known to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay Colony settlers, consists of a single irregular street running along high ground between the North and South Rivers. Branching off at intervals on either side of this spine, short streets lead to one or the other river. Along its north side lies the town common, now lined with handsome brick houses.</p>
<p><name type="place">New Haven</name> was settled in <date when="1638">1638</date> as a nine-square grid&#x2014;that is, a square composed of nine blocks, each measuring 825 feet (251.5 meters) square&#x2014;fitted between two streams entering a harbor on the north shore of Long Island Sound (fig. 6.46). The central square, reserved as a green to be held in common, thus constitutes one-ninth of the town, an unusual amount of public space for that period, even in <name type="place">New England</name> where commons were an important feature of town planning. The meetinghouse, the central institution of the religiously ruled <name type="place">New England</name> com-<lb/>
munity, was always given pride of place in any plan-<lb/>
ning scheme, being located atop a prominent topographical elevation or, in the case of <name type="place">New Haven</name> and many other towns, adjacent to, or within, the cen-<lb/>
tral common. Outside the town boundaries lay the fields, which were typically laid out as long narrow strips of land and parceled to proprietors by lottery or some other equitable means. In this suburban zone were additional common lands reserved as cattle pas-<lb/>
tures and timber lands. As <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s population expanded, its green was bisected, with three churches occupying one half, while the other half remained as open public space. In addition, each of its eight remaining blocks was subdivided into four smaller blocks as townsmen surrendered for houses the areas reserved for garden plots. Houses also lined the radial thoroughfares leading from the boundaries of the nine-square grid to the waterfront and to the fields, for at its inception <name type="place">New Haven</name> had attracted more settlers from <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> than the originally planned number of 250. The town's importance increased when, in <date when="1717">1717</date>, the newly founded Yale Col-<lb/>
lege was moved from Saybrook to one of the blocks adjacent to the green.</p>
<p>The foresight demonstrated in <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s planning and that of other <name type="place">New England</name> towns does not entirely account for their scenic character. The combination of site and architecture, the latter a prod-<lb/>
uct of several generations of thoughtfully erected buildings using a limited range of visually pleasing materials, produced the townscape that is admired today wherever it has not been sacrificed to meet the needs of the automobile. The ordered serenity of these towns, which are often nestled in the folds of the glaciated <name type="place">New England</name> landscape with its natu-<lb/>
rally picturesque ponds and hills, provides modern vacationers with a glimpse of an earlier <name type="place">America</name> that is still capable of stirring emotions both patriotic and nostalgic. Save for a few well-tended historic sites, there is little evidence of the rude and cramped houses of the first settlers. Instead, especially in towns where historic preservation is fueled by sufficient afflu-<lb/>
ence, one finds a harmony of later architectural styles. The Neoclassicism favored by the builders of the young republic is seen in columned porticoes and broad pediments, while nearby the turreted solidity of neo-Romanesque rusticated stone betokens the prosperity of the victorious Union after the Civil War when manufacturing wealth made possible the fur-<lb/>
ther architectural adornment of this part of the coun-<lb/>
try. But sadly missing are most of the elms that, before the twentieth-century blight of Dutch elm disease, lifted their graceful canopies over village greens, college campuses, and roadways.</p>

<p>This generally satisfying townscape is the result of a consensual attitude on the part of the inhabi-<lb/>
tants regarding those elements that collectively por-<lb/>
tray community. Perhaps more than elsewhere in the United States, one apprehends in the physiognomy of the <name type="place">New England</name> town American republican polit-<lb/>
ical values. Not surprisingly, the nineteenth-century French student of democracy Alexis de Tocqueville, in tracing the modern origins of this experiment in human governance, emphasized the formative influ-<lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
<pb n="224" type="orig"/>
ence of the colonial <name type="place">New England</name> township. But underlying this expression of a democratic social structure was a basic Puritan one that had envisioned a controlled hierarchical ordering of the town.<ref target="#CH6-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> If not prescribed in the manner of the Spanish <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, this paradigm did have an ex post facto cod-<lb/>
ification in an anonymous and less detailed docu-<lb/>
ment entitled "The Ordering of Towns." It presupposed townships 6 square miles (9.7 square kilometers) in area, which were to be arranged in six concentric zones around a central meetinghouse, with outlying lands held as commons in the manner of English villages before the enclosure movement. The allotment was to be in accordance with "the con-<lb/>
dition of mankind," or according to social and eco-<lb/>
nomic status, with the fifth ring of settlement having the largest and most desirable parcels consisting of 30 to 40 acres of arable land, woodlot, and meadow.</p>
<p>In spite of the lament of <name type="pname">Governor Bradford</name> and sermons by divines such as Cotton Mather castigat-<lb/>
ing land-hungry "outlivers," those who settled more than half a mile distant from the meetinghouse, this strongly nucleated ideal was destined to be modified as the first settlers began to produce surplus livestock for sale to newcomers and the need for additional lands grew apace. More and more outlying land became owner-occupied as the commodities it pro-<lb/>
duced engendered trade, and convenience and secu-<lb/>
rity dictated that entrepreneurial settlers take up residence on their properties. Thus, from the begin-<lb/>
ning, commercial forces vied with those that pro-<lb/>
moted compact community settlement. The spatial configuration of the <name type="place">New England</name> town was there-<lb/>
fore the result of the modification of sectarian atti-<lb/>
tudes and the adaptation of the agrarian mores brought from <name type="place">Old England</name> to a new physical, social, and economic environment.</p>

<p>If sectarian fervor combined with an increasingly trade-oriented population characterized the early set-<lb/>

<p>As governor and proprietor of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> under a charter granted by <name type="pname">King Charles II</name> in <date when="1681">1681</date>, <name type="pname">Penn</name> approached the task of colonization as an administrator and businessman. He developed a land distribution program that granted city lots on a basis proportionate to the size of a purchaser's overall land holdings. He sent three commissioners with the first group of settlers, enjoining them to select a healthy and navigable site for the city, which they had located by the summer of <date when="1682">1682</date> on land midway between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers.</p>
<p>The plan <name type="pname">Penn</name> envisioned for his city was one in which uniform streets were to stretch from the country bounds to the water's edge. With <name type="place">London</name>'s Great Fire of <date when="1666">1666</date> still fresh in his memory, he wrote, "Let every house be placed, if the person pleases, in the middle of its plat, as to the breadth of it, that so there may be ground on each side for gardens or orchards, or fields, that it may be a green country town, which will never be burnt, and always be whole-<lb/>
some."<ref target="#CH6-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref> In this fashion did <name type="pname">Penn</name> enunciate the ideal that homeowning Americans have embraced over the course of three hundred years&#x2014;a freestanding house surrounded by its own plot of land. To assist in the task of laying out the new city, he appointed <name type="pname">Captain Thomas Holme</name> as surveyor general.</p>
<p>With <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s arrival in <date when="1682-10">October 1682</date>, the plan for the city began to take shape under his personal direction. He had Holme draw a gridiron bounded on the east by the Delaware and on the west by the Schuylkill, with a central square at the crossing of its two principal axes, Broad Street and High Street (fig. 6.47). Familiar with <name type="pname">Lincoln</name>'s Inn Fields and Moor-<lb/>
fields&#x2014;open spaces accessible to the general public in <name type="place">London</name>&#x2014;the city's recently developed private res-<lb/>
idential squares, and probably at least one of the sev-<lb/>
eral post-Great Fire plans calling for urban green space, he directed Holme to place a square within each quadrant of the city. <name type="pname">Penn</name> was explicit that they be open to all members of the community, unlike the new <name type="place">London</name> squares, which were reserved for the exclusive use of neighboring property owners.</p>
<p>The public square, along with the freestanding home with its adjacent garden, was <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s important contribution to the future American cityscape, for the
<pb n="225"/>
<pb n="225" type="orig"/>
gridiron plan, punctuated with one or more of these green spaces, became the model that settlers applied almost ubiquitously to new communities as they moved westward. Sometimes occupied by court-<lb/>
houses or other public buildings, such squares every-<lb/>
where denote civic intention and community focus.</p>
<p>As in <name type="place">New Haven</name>, <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s generously scaled blocks became subdivided as row houses were built along narrow streets inserted where gardens had been intended. This happened also in other cities as popu-<lb/>
lation growth accelerated and speculation in urban land increased. Where land speculators platted grids designed to realize a maximum profit from lot sales, the squares of <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s "green country town" were often eliminated or reduced to a single token public space. There existed, however, another important example of American colonial planning in which a gra-<lb/>
cious and livable city&#x2014;Savannah, <name type="place">Georgia</name>&#x2014;was built and maintained over a long period of time according to the intentions of its founder.</p>
</div>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">James Oglethorpe's Savannah</name></hi></head>
<p>In <date when="1732">1732</date>, <name type="pname">James Oglethorpe</name> (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785">1785</date>), an English philanthropist and member of Parliament who was interested in prison reform, secured a charter from <name type="pname">King George II</name> for the founding of the colony of <name type="place">Geor-<lb/>
gia</name>. Here he hoped, with a subscription of funds raised from a group of humane aristocrats, to transport incarcerated debtors who wished to seek a fresh start in life as well as persons experiencing religious perse-<lb/>
cution and others eager for economic opportunity. The following year found him working indefatigably alongside the 114 original colonists, supervising the clearing of a large rectangular area of the tall pine for-<lb/>
est where his town was to be laid out along a crescent bend in the Savannah River 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) inland from the sea. A palisade was soon erected and the first houses built even as the terms of property deeds were being defined. These deeds demonstrate the regional scope of <name type="pname">Oglethorpe</name>'s plan, which granted each settler a house lot measuring 60 by 90 feet (18.3 by 27.4 meters), a 5-acre garden plot, and a 44-acre farm, with the stipulation that he must con-<lb/>
struct a house within an eighteen-month period and cultivate at least 10 acres of his outlying farmland.</p>
<p>Like <name type="pname">Penn</name>, <name type="pname">Oglethorpe</name> was familiar with the pattern of residential development in <name type="place">London</name> whereby groups of houses were being built specula-<lb/>
tively around green squares, a process that the pros-<lb/>
perity of <name type="place">Georgian England</name> had accelerated. He was probably also familiar with the plans for <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> and <name type="place">New Haven</name>. But the original and ingenious fea-<lb/>
ture of his plan for Savannah was the concept of the ward as a group of forty house lots laid out as four tithings," or blocks of ten houses each, with the blocks ranged beside a central green, next to two sides of which two large lots were reserved for churches and other public and semipublic buildings such as stores. Savannah therefore was not to be laid out, like <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> or <name type="place">New Haven</name>, as an urban grid with one or more spaces exempted from develop-<lb/>
ment; rather the grid was to be formed additively by ward units, each with a green square in the center. This meant that, as the city grew, it could never become a solid urban mass because it would always have an open green square within each new ward (figs. 6.48, 6.49).</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">American Colonial Gardens</hi></head>
<p>Because life for the first American colonists in <name type="place">New England</name> was extremely harsh, such gardens as they made were purely utilitarian, providing food and medicinal herbs. While Puritans may have had little interest in ornamental horticulture, the settlers sent over by the Dutch West India Company remembered from their homeland such small intricate late Renais-<lb/>
sance gardens with <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> beds, topiary, arbors, and fountains as are seen in the garden pattern books of <name type="pname">Hans Vredeman de Vries</name> and <name type="pname">Jan van der Groen</name> (see figs. 6.2 and 6.3). <name type="pname">Peter Stuyvesant</name>, the Director Gen-<lb/>
eral of the Dutch West India Company in <name type="place">New Ams-<lb/>
terdam</name> between <date when="1646">1646</date> to <date when="1664">1664</date>, had, for example, next to his residence on the Battery in Manhattan a gar-<lb/>
den with <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and fruit trees arranged around a simple axis. Most of the Dutch colonists he oversaw, however, practiced a utilitarian horticulture, and early views of the island show several <hi rend="italic">bouweries</hi>, as they called their small farms with orchards.</p>
<p>Promotional tracts aimed at recruiting colonists extolled the natural bounty of the land, making <name type="place">America</name> sometimes appear as a second Eden. In <name type="place">Vir-<lb/>
ginia</name> and the Carolinas, where climate and soil were especially hospitable for gardening and novel speci-<lb/>
mens abundant, settlers combined in their gardens the plants grown in their native <name type="place">England</name> with botan-<lb/>
ical discoveries from their new homeland. Like colonists elsewhere, their interest was primarily in plants that could nourish them or cure their ills. <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, the colonial capital <name type="pname">Governor Francis Nicholson</name> (<date when="1655">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) and his successor <name type="pname">Alexander Spotswood</name> (<date when="1676">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740">1740</date>) planned with a degree of ele-<lb/>
gance beginning in <date when="1699">1699</date>, became an important cen-<lb/>
ter for the development of gardening in <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="pname">Nicholson</name>, when he was governor of <name type="place">Maryland</name>, had laid out Annapolis in a novel manner for colonial <name type="place">America</name>. His plan for that city featured two large cir-<lb/>
cles and radial steets intersecting grid blocks. Now he brought his planning experience to bear on <name type="place">Williams-<lb/>
burg</name>, achieving a dignified urban design with the Capitol at the eastern end of its principal axis&#x2014;Duke of Gloucester Street&#x2014;and the newly founded Col-<lb/>
lege of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> at the western. At a right angle to Duke of Gloucester Street, a broad grassy swath known as the palace green led to the site of the Governor's Palace.</p>

<figDesc>6.50. Governor's Palace and Gardens, <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, <name type="place">Virginia</name></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>When Spotswood came to occupy this mansion in <date when="1710">1710</date>, he continued the axis of the palace green in the gardens he laid out behind it and encouraged as the mark of genteel civilization the planting of orchards and gardens here and at the college (fig. 6.50). An intelligent site planner, Spotswood also helped place several buildings in the new town in relationship to open spaces and view lines. Unfortu-<lb/>
nately, he abused an informal understanding he had with another prominent colonist, <name type="pname">John Custis</name> (<date when="1678">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1749">1749</date>), when he cut down several more trees than anticipated on the latter's property in order to open up a "visto," probably that along the palace green. He also aroused the ire of the House of Burgesses when he transformed the ravine behind the Governor's Palace into a series of elaborate terraces and built a rectangular canal connected to a fish pond and a large park. The legislators balked at the earth-moving and excavation costs incurred in building "the Fish-Pond and Falling gardens," putting to an end Spotwood's landscaping efforts at <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, but not before he had set the tone for its future development.</p>
<p>In the affluent western half of the town, colonists laid out utilitarian gardens that were, nev-<lb/>
ertheless, modeled on those of the Governor's Palace, their straight gravel paths flanked by topiary after the fashion established a few years earlier in the royal gar-<lb/>
dens of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> and those of the country estates designed during their English reign (see figs. 6.10&#x2013;6.12). In his garden Custis displayed some of the botanical specimens that were then arousing scien-<lb/>
tific curiosity as a lively transatlantic seed exchange began to occur. Nearby plantation owners, notably <name type="pname">William Byrd</name> and his son, <name type="pname">William Byrd II</name>, both mem-<lb/>
bers of <name type="place">London</name>'s Royal Society, were active in recruit-<lb/>
ing such naturalists as <name type="pname">William Banister</name> (<date when="1654">1654</date>&#x2013;<date when="1692">1692</date>) to come to <name type="place">Virginia</name> to study the flora of the region, and their activities also promoted the use of native plants in town gardens. The Byrds' Westover planta-<lb/>
tion served as a laboratory for botanical experiments in which Banister, who also had his own botanical garden, assisted until his untimely death on a collect-<lb/>
ing expedition with the elder Byrd.</p>
<pb n="227"/>
<pb n="227" type="orig"/>
<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century, <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, like <name type="pname">Charleston</name>, had become an impor-<lb/>
tant center for the transmission of botanical knowl-<lb/>
edge among plantation owners, town gardeners, and interested parties back home in <name type="place">England</name>. Many of <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>'s gardens were reconstructed by the Rockefeller Foundation beginning in <date when="1926">1926</date> (see Chap-<lb/>
ter Fifteen). The landscape architect in charge, <name type="pname">Arthur Shurcliff</name>, researched the Dutch-English landscape style of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> prevailing at the time of the town's foundation, studying existing <name type="place">Virginia</name> site plans and archaeological remains. He subsequently created geometric <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and topiary as well as a holly maze in the same configuration as the one of yew at Hampton Court.</p>
<p>The most splendid gardens of the colonial period were those belonging to wealthy southern plantation owners who enjoyed the benefits of a mild climate and were able to employ a large workforce of slaves in garden construction. In the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury, as <name type="place">Virginia</name> and the Carolinas became the locus of much botanical activity, these southern gardens displayed many plants new to horticulture.</p>
<p>Along the James River in <name type="place">Virginia</name>, tobacco gen-<lb/>
erated the wealth that enabled great estate holders to landscape their properties with graceful terraces lead-<lb/>
ing to river landings, the usual means of approach to a plantation mansion, although they also dignified their inland entrance drives by planting long <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> of trees on either side. <name type="pname">Carter</name>'s Grove, the plantation begun in <date when="1751">1751</date> by <name type="pname">Carter Burwell</name>, was ambitiously landscaped in this fashion. Near Charleston, <name type="place">South Carolina</name>, where rice and indigo were the basis of a prosperous colonial economy, the terraced slopes of the gardens above the Ashley and Cooper Rivers were called falls. Many of the once-great gardens that lined the banks of these two rivers succumbed to the Amer-<lb/>
ican Revolution and the Civil War as well as to natu-<lb/>
ral disasters and the misfortunes of time. There remains, however, one excellent representative exam-<lb/>
ple, Middleton Place, which is open to the public. Descendants of the original owner, <name type="pname">Henry Middle-<lb/>
ton</name>, have restored the gardens their ancestor laid out in <date when="1741">1741</date> beside the Ashley River (figs. 6.51, 6.52).</p>
<p>Although it is an eighteenth-century garden, Middleton Place does not stand within the tradition of contemporary English landscape design, but rather harks back to the earlier style of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> exemplified at <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>. From the Charleston Road on the inland side a long drive becomes a sweep-<lb/>
ing oval turnaround, carrying the visitor past the sta-<lb/>
bles to the point where the main house once stood. This principal axis continues opposite the house site, becoming the spine of the gardens' most original fea-<lb/>
ture, the falls, a series of five gracefully bowed grassy terraces, the curves of which are echoed in the pair of lakes that form the shape of a butterfly where the garden meets the plantation's low-lying rice fields and the causeway leading to the river landing.</p>

<p><name type="pname">George Washington</name> (<date when="1732">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799">1799</date>) was a <name type="place">Virginia</name> landowner whose prosperity depended upon rev-<lb/>
enues derived from agriculture and livestock. His home at Mount Vernon, high above the Potomac, was one of five farms he worked on the banks of the river. As a son of the Enlightenment, he followed with keen interest not only those developments in botan-<lb/>
ical science that were of benefit to agronomy but also the exciting discoveries that were enriching the palette of ornamental horticulture. Although he lacked <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>'s firsthand knowledge of contem-<lb/>
porary English and French landscape design, he owned engravings by <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name> and responded aesthetically to the Picturesque and sublime, which he found at hand in the unspoiled beauties of the American scene. With no more professional advice than that found in his garden books, including a copy of <name type="pname">Batty Langley</name>'s <hi rend="italic">New Principles of Gardening</hi>, he fash-<lb/>
ioned the grounds around his Mount Vernon resi-<lb/>
dence and took considerable pleasure in growing his fruit trees, planting evergreen and flowering shrubs, and propagating plants in his greenhouse.</p>
<p>The drawing by <name type="pname">Samuel Vaughan</name> (<date when="1787">1787</date>) of <name type="place">Washington</name>'s plan for laying out the grounds at Mount Vernon shows the house with its broad veranda facing the river (fig. 6.53). To the rear of the house, a circular drive outlines a round lawn, and a pair of serpentine, symmetrical drives define a large pear- or bell-shaped bowling green before converg-<lb/>
ing in the drive leading to the highway. Two "wilder-<lb/>
nesses" at its western end and a surrounding belt of trees, many of them native species&#x2014;crab apple, poplar, locust, pine, maple, dogwood, black gum, ash, elm, holly, mulberry, hemlock, magnolia, laurel, wil-<lb/>
low, sassafras, linden, arbor vitae, aspen, pine&#x2014;gave further definition and enclosure to the bowling green. A conservatory housed his collection of rare botani-<lb/>
cal specimens.</p>
<p>On opposite sides of the bowling green <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington</name> placed two gardens, one for flowers and the other for vegetables. He laid these out as geometric beds and screened them from the more informally composed adjacent grounds with walls, curving their ends in order to mediate the visual transition between their lines and those of the serpentine walks. In addi-<lb/>
tion to planting thickly the space in between the gar-<lb/>
den walls and the bowling green, he constructed two earthen mounds next to the entrance drive, setting weeping willows beside them while leaving open a view of the distant woods.</p>
<p>Two groves of trees flanked the house on the east, and here he turned the sloping grounds into a deer park and planted low-growing shrubs so as not to interrupt the vista framed by his classical portico of rising hills ranging into the blue distance. A ha-ha, or continuous ditch, served as an invisible fence, thus preventing deer from grazing adjacent to the house. In keeping with contemporary practice for rural bur-<lb/>

vated ground overlooking the river.</p>

At the same time, practical and scientific horticulture continued to be for him a lively passion. He corresponded with nurserymen and botanists in <name type="place">America</name> and abroad and placed orders for trees, shrubs, and seeds. He visited the gardens of the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> plantsman <name type="pname">John Bartram</name> and the newly established Prince nursery in Flushing, Long Island.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Washington</name> may perhaps be credited as being the father of that important national institution, the American lawn. Another contemporary visitor, <name type="pname">Julian Niemcewicz</name>, a Polish aristocrat, called Mount Ver-<lb/>

<p>Unable on political grounds to choose as a national capital one among the colonial cities of the thirteen states that formed the original federation, the founders of the new nation decided for reasons both practical and symbolical to create an entirely new city in the sparsely settled countryside bordering <name type="place">Maryland</name> and <name type="place">Virginia</name>. Shortly after Congress enacted the legislation that created a federal district in <date when="1790">1790</date>, <name type="pname">Washington</name> retained Pierre Charles L'Enfant (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>) to pre-<lb/>
pare a plan for it (fig. 6.54). L'Enfant, a French artist and architect who had come to <name type="place">America</name> as a volunteer in the cause of the Revolution, had risen to the rank of major in the Corps of Engineers. After the war, he stayed on to find work in the new United States. It was a time when other young French professionals, deprived of their former <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> patrons by the revolution in <name type="place">France</name>, were emigrating to the bur-<lb/>
geoning eastern seaboard cities in this country Upon hearing of the decision to establish a new capital, L'En-<lb/>
fant, who was designing and remodeling mansions in <name type="place">New York City</name>, wrote to <name type="pname">Washington</name> offering to draw up a plan for the new city. In accepting the French archi-<lb/>
tect's offer, <name type="pname">Washington</name>, whether he realized this irony or not, was, in effect, importing a planning vision expressive of autocratic monarchy as the paradigm for a new kind of national grandeur based upon the prin-<lb/>
ciples of revolution and the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>L'Enfant had, in fact, spent eight of his boyhood years at <name type="place">Versailles</name> where his father, Pierre L'Enfant, was employed in decorating the building of the Min-<lb/>
istry of War. He had subsequently enrolled in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in <name type="place">Paris</name> and was therefore aware of all the developments, both royal and private, to embellish that capital. His first assignment from <name type="pname">Washington</name> was to assess the topo-<lb/>
graphic qualities of the site, and in accordance with the theory of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>, the plan that he proposed did not imply the arbitrary imposition of a preconceived scheme upon nature, but rather used existing landforms as the basis of design. In particu-<lb/>
lar, <name type="pname">Jenkin</name>'s Hill, the area's highest eminence, was sin-<lb/>
gled out as the "pedestal waiting for a superstructure," the suggested site for the United States Capitol in the memorandum that L'Enfant submitted with his final version of the plan in <date when="1791-08">August 1791</date>.<ref target="#CH6-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>L'Enfant's plan disposed buildings and streets in a manner that brought the various elements of the union&#x2014;executive and legislature as well as the sev-<lb/>
eral states&#x2014;into a subtly conceived iconographic fed-<lb/>
eration.<ref target="#CH6-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref> Like <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>, who had also drawn up a plan for the new capital in <date when="1791">1791</date>, L'Enfant pro-<lb/>
posed a street grid. But instead of <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s uniform grid, L'Enfant's was overlaid with another diagram consisting of squares and circles connected by diago-<lb/>
nal avenues. The plan was comparable to that of L'En-<lb/>
fant's boyhood town of <name type="place">Versailles</name>, a grid punctuated with squares and set within a framework of super-<lb/>
imposed diagonal axes.</p>
<p>Although the urban scale fostered by an ambi-<lb/>
tious monarch at <name type="place">Versailles</name> was expansive, that of <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, was more so. The new capital city set at the edge of a vast continent was proportioned to reflect the the opportunity of abundant untenanted land as well as the ambitions of its founders. The major avenues were 160 feet (49 meters) wide, with 80 feet (24 meters) reserved for the roadbed and 30 feet (9 meters) for flanking walkways. These walk-<lb/>
ways were defined by double rows of trees, and there was an additional 10-foot strip separating the trees from the adjacent building lots on either side.</p>
<p>These great tree-lined avenues were named for the then-existing states and grouped roughly accord-<lb/>
ing to their geography with the northeastern states in the northern part of the district, the mid-Atlantic states in the center and the southern states in the southeastern section. <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Avenue, the cor-<lb/>
ridor linking the Capitol on <name type="pname">Jenkin</name>'s Hill and the Pres-<lb/>
ident's House, which was sited on an alluvial escarpment sloping up from the Potomac, was given pride of place, thereby honoring the importance of that state as host to the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitutional Convention. Similarly, the intersection of <name type="place">New York</name> Avenue with the square in which the President's House was located commemorated <name type="place">New York City</name>'s former status as the capital of the Continental Congress and the site where <name type="pname">Washington</name> took the presidential oath of office.</p>
<p>The Mall (abbreviated from Pall Mall) was described by <name type="pname">L'Enfant</name> as a "grand Avenue, 400 feet in breadth, and about a mile in length, bordered with gardens, ending in a slope from the houses on each side."<ref target="#CH6-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref> This Mall, which in L'Enfant's words would give <name type="pname">Washington</name> "a superiority of agreements" over most other cities, was to be the home of "theaters, assembly halls, academies"&#x2014;purpose-built structures catering to the entertainment, social, and intellectual needs of a democratic society. L'Enfant's plan also included Judiciary Square, the site chosen for the Supreme Court, and fifteen other squares. These were to be assigned to the then-existing states (<name type="pname">Ken-<lb/>
tucky</name> and <name type="pname">Tennessee</name> had recently joined the thirteen colonial states that formed the union) with the hope that their citizens would appropriate, through private subscription, funds for their improvement.</p>
<p>In brief, given the equivalent of a blank slate upon which to work, L'Enfant transcended the con-<lb/>
joined garden-town model of his native <name type="place">Versailles</name>, creating in <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, a city with many gar-<lb/>
dens within it. This combination of green openness and urban monumentality constitutes the American capital's uniqueness.</p>
<p>It is clear from the foregoing that cities were devel-<lb/>
oping in a manner that made them physically and conceptually different from their predecessors. They were expanding and becoming ungirdled, their walls torn down, a physical metaphor perhaps for the way in which philosophers were embracing open-ended scientific inquiry. Furthermore, in the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury, their cultural contents were enlarged as new institutions were incorporated into the urban fabric. Formerly the province of princes or private universi-<lb/>
ties, botanical and zoological gardens, libraries, muse-<lb/>
ums, theaters, and opera houses were now considered the rightful legacy of the urban bourgeoisie. A fun-<lb/>
damental result of the American and French Revolu-<lb/>
tions was the creation of a sense of popular entitlement. By the nineteenth century, cultural insti-<lb/>
tutions were considered an essential part of the pub-<lb/>
lic domain. One institution, the public park, became an especially important element in the altered social structure of cities. From its inception, one American city, <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, contained many parklike ele-<lb/>
ments; in building Central Park a little over a half cen-<lb/>
tury later <name type="place">New York City</name> spearheaded a movement for the creation of public parks throughout the nation, in which the notion of <hi rend="italic">rus en urbe</hi>, an artful fusion of country and city, was promoted as an essential moral and public health benefit.</p>
<p>In summary, the urban fabric was becoming more loosely woven and of more generous dimen-<lb/>
sions. As cities grew, tore down their walls, and blurred the line between urban and rural, the human attitude toward nature was significantly transformed. The spreading city gradually engulfed the rural coun-<lb/>
tryside, and nature became an increasingly important component within the urban framework. The cre-<lb/>
ation of naturalistic parks, however, did not occur without a cultural shift. That change was becoming apparent in the relaxation of French landscape design norms at the end of the seventeenth century. But to grasp the character of this change more fully, we must turn to eighteenth-century <name type="place">England</name>.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>he concept of landscape as varied and diverse scenery to be contemplated and appreciated rather than nature demanding to be tamed and ordered, was a novel one at the dawn of the eigh-<lb/>
teenth century. Both poetry and the development of landscape painting as a specific genre stimulated and influenced a growing taste for rural scenery and landscape designs that reflected the mind's sensations and moods.</p>
<p>With the couplet that serves as his memorable epi-<lb/>
taph&#x2014;"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night,/God said, 'let <name type="pname">Newton</name> be,' and all was light"&#x2014;poet, essayist, and garden enthusiast <name type="pname">Alexander Pope</name> (<date when="1688">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1744">1744</date>) epitomized the place in history of the great English physicist and mathematician <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name> (<date when="1642">1642</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727">1727</date>). With the discovery of the optical properties of light, definition of the laws of motion, develop-<lb/>
ment of an infinitesimal calculus, and formulation of the law of universal gravitation, <name type="pname">Newton</name> effectively laid the foundations of modern science. What followed was an unprecedented con-<lb/>
fidence in human reason. <name type="pname">Newton</name> fathered the Enlightenment and was a correspondent and later president of the Royal Soci-<lb/>
ety, which promoted open-ended scientific discovery in an era when the universities still taught according to an Aristotelian pedagogy that presupposed the systematization of scholarship within an all-encompassing, self-contained framework.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Newton</name>'s contemporary <name type="pname">John Locke</name> (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704">1704</date>) was a philosopher whose vision of epistemology, politics, education, and medicine helped lay the groundwork for a new human psy-<lb/>
chology as well as for a new empirical approach to science. Taking issue with Descartes's belief in the mind as a repository of innate ideas, he declared that, to the contrary, all knowledge of the world must rest on sensory experience. This concept of the mind as an instrument for inductive reasoning and a theater for personal experience, rather than as a receptacle for revealed Truth and immutable law, had an important effect on garden design in the eighteenth century as landscapes were contrived to furnish the sensate mind with specific mental associations and impressions.</p>
<p>As a physical manifestation of the intellectual philosophy laid out in <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</hi> (<date when="1690">1690</date>), and the consequent authority granted to individual sen-<lb/>
sibility, the garden assumed a new character and function. Its role as a place of authoritarian power, display, and social enter-<lb/>
tainment was diminished as it became a place of meditation, reflection, and friendship. <name type="pname">Locke</name> provides the key to under-<lb/>
standing the emphasis upon the associative potential of garden scenes in the eighteenth century. As the intellectual tradition of Neoplatonic classicism waned and landscape design based upon the notion of an underlying normative order of harmonic pro-<lb/>
portion ceased to be influential, the desire to produce stimuli for a wide range of mental experiences and emotions fostered a new kind of garden making. Its orientation toward sensibility, rather than abstract beauty, caused patrons and designers to value ancient architectural styles, ruins, commemorative monuments, and a richly varied natural scenery. These provoked admiration and reflection, induced moral instruction, and created pleasur-<lb/>
able surprise.</p>
<p>The intellectual freedom engendered by <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s fresh examination of the workings of the human mind fostered and supported the contemporary climate of political change. <name type="pname">Locke</name> was taken into the household of <name type="pname">Baron Ashley</name> (later the first earl of Shaftesbury) as a physician. He proved to be an influential confidant of that statesman as well, working toward the goals of increased civil liberty, constitutional monarchy, parliamentary rule, religious toleration, Protestant succession, and mercantile trade. Thus, although the actual gardens of his own day were the

French-inspired ones of the Restoration and the Anglo-Dutch gardens of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>, <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s belief in political free-<lb/>
dom, together with his seminal ideas on sensory awareness, provided the intellectual soil for the gardens of <name type="pname">Georgian England</name>. The result was a more naturalistic style, with architec-<lb/>
tural and ornamental elements used as images to stimulate ideas of a historical, ethical, partisan, or sentimental nature, thus pro-<lb/>

ian garden.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</name> (<date when="1712">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">1778</date>), in his philosophical and political discourses on the importance of reverie and the power of the imagination, extended <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s influence. The mind as a self-aware organ, capable of feats of intuition as well as reason, could produce visions of a more perfect human soci-<lb/>
ety. Inspired by images of ancient Sparta and republican <name type="place">Rome</name> as well as of his native city of Geneva, he set forth in <hi rend="italic">The Social Contract</hi> (<date when="1762">1762</date>) a doctrine of human equality and political democracy.</p>
<p>Believing in the innate goodness of "natural man" and in the inspirational character of nature, <name type="pname">Rousseau</name> became a prophet not only for the political revolutionaries who read in him their own social visions, but also of Romanticism. This movement, which gained force at the end of the eighteenth century and extends into our own day, posed a spiritual counterbalance to the scientific rationalism of the Enlightenment. Emotion and visionary intuition as a mode of human perception became as important as thought and rational calculation. <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s phi-<lb/>
losophy, which enlarged the freedom <name type="pname">Locke</name> had granted the senses, was instrumental in reinvesting classicism with poetic visions of a lost Golden Age. It is understandable, therefore, that the eighteenth-century garden&#x2014;a place particularly congenial to reverie, recollection, reflection, and imaginative participation in an ideal world beyond "corrupt" civilization&#x2014;owed a debt to his theories. Appropriately, it was in the romantically conceived garden of the <name type="pname">Marquis de Girardin</name> at Ermenonville that <name type="pname">Rous-<lb/>
seau</name> sought refuge at the end of his life.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Rousseau</name> was the intellectual heir not only to <name type="pname">Locke</name>, but also to Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury (<date when="1671">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1713">1713</date>), an Enlightenment writer who, like <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>, believed in the innate goodness of natural man and of nature. Shaftesbury saw landscapes as having personality; he cried out to the "Genius of the Place,"<ref target="#CH7-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> the spirit that interacts with the human mind, eliciting emotions, fostering perceptions, stimu-<lb/>
lating both memory and curiosity. Shaftesbury advocated grot-<lb/>
toes, cascades, and other dramatically charged landscape forms as a means of stimulating mental associations with nature's mysteries. His thoughts influenced Addison and Pope, writers whose garden theories were influential at the time when a series of emblematically significant English gardens&#x2014;including most notably Stowe and <name type="pname">Castle Howard</name>&#x2014;were being created.</p>
<p>As the associative potential of gardens to thematically por-<lb/>
tray a particular ideology became less compelling and the enclo-<lb/>
sure movement gathered force, English landscape design tradition evolved into the abstractly expressive style of <name type="pname">"Capa-<lb/>
bility" Brown</name> and, subsequently, into the Picturesque style with its Rococo inflection, which proved especially popular in <name type="place">France</name>, where the style's variant of the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> was termed the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi>. The Picturesque theorists who set themselves in opposition to <name type="pname">Brown</name> engendered a great deal of spirited debate because the eighteenth-century garden remained an arena of aesthetic idealism even after it had become less didactically explicit. The relationship between landscape and political and intellectual philosophy was important not only in <name type="place">Europe</name> but also in the newly formed <name type="place">United States of Amer-<lb/>
ica</name> where <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name> imaginatively took up the task of garden design while also shaping a vision for an agrarian nation of continental dimensions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important eighteenth-century minds besides <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s to further the trend toward Romanticism in the West and to anticipate the coming age's commitment to industrial capitalism and democracy were those of the German polymath and poet <name type="pname">Goethe</name> and the seminal English poet <name type="pname">Word-<lb/>
sworth</name>. Although both had practical experience in garden design, their influence was more broadly cultural. <name type="pname">Goethe</name> saw nature as a source of experiential ecstasy that could, if carried to excess as was the tendency of his time, be debilitating as well as exhilarating. In <hi rend="italic">Faust Part II</hi> he also anticipated the dark Romanticism implicit in Nietzsche's notion of a Superman. By portraying his famous protagonist in the guise of industrial developer&#x2014;Faust's ultimate quest for experience and ascen-<lb/>
dance over nature and the rest of humankind&#x2014;<name type="pname">Goethe</name> foresaw the exponential release of new sources of energy and capitalist power that would occur as the Industrial Revolution gained momentum. <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s poems also encouraged intense and intimate communion with and reflection upon nature. For <name type="pname">Word-<lb/>
sworth</name>, love of nature was inevitably conjoined with reverence for the human mind, the noble instrument of Lockean percep-<lb/>
tion, without which nature's marvelous beauty would be as naught. In addition, <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> fostered empathy for common humanity, finding simple, honest beauty in the quotidian expe-<lb/>
rience of ordinary lives. Thus, <name type="pname">Goethe</name> and <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> are piv-<lb/>
otal, carrying forward into the nineteenth century the strikingly important eighteenth-century concept that "the genius of the place" and human genius, a gift to all mortals, are inextricably allied.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Genius of the Place: Forging a New Landscape Style through Literature, Art, and Theory</hi></hi></head>
<p>Many advocates of the naturalistic garden read into <name type="pname">John Milton</name>'s description of Eden in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> a vision of a new style innocent of "nice Art / In Beds and curious Knots. &#x2026; / A happy rural seat of various view. &#x2026;"<ref target="#CH7-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> But <name type="pname">Alexander Pope</name> was the poet most responsible for turning English garden design in a dif-<lb/>
ferent direction. By his writing and example, Pope actively publicized the style of landscape design favored by the <name type="pname">Whig</name> aristocracy and gentry as well as their literary and artistic friends. These <name type="pname">Whig</name> land-<lb/>
owners, often with Pope's advice, initiated projects that wed English taste for country houses in the archi-<lb/>
tectural style of <name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name> with English scenery, creating landscapes that attempted to evoke "the genius of the place."</p>
<p>Their creation of a new landscape style was less radical, and more evolutionary, than subsequent chau-<lb/>
vinistic generations would like to believe. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s follower <name type="pname">Antoine-Joseph</name> <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name> (<date when="1680">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765">1765</date>) published in <date when="1712">1712</date> an English edition of his <date when="1709">1709</date> influential treatise <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pratique du jardinage</hi> in which he proposed that art give way to nature. The variety and irregularity he advocated within his otherwise geometrical plans showed the gradual relaxation of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s authoritarian style around the time of the king's death when a more lib-<lb/>
eral culture began to be reflected in all the arts. While envisioning a different end from that which Pope had in mind when advising <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name> to "Consult the Genius of the Place in all," it was <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>, not an Englishman, who first suggested the ha-ha, a contin-<lb/>
uous ditch that acted as a sunken fence permitting the visual unification of the garden and its surrounding countryside. But the naturalistic style soon became almost exclusively identified with <name type="place">England</name>. This was due substantially to the pains <name type="pname">Whig</name> aristocrats took to express belief felt in their country's civil liberties.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Literary Proponents of a New Style</hi></hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Joseph Addison</name> (<date when="1672">1672</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719">1719</date>) in his essays in <hi rend="italic">The Tat-<lb/>
ler</hi>_and <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi> argued for a kind of landscape improvement that was anti-authoritarian and practical. He thought that "a Man might make a pretty Landskip of his own Possessions" merely by planting oaks on his hilltops, recognizing the beauty of his willow-filled marshes and fields of grain and improving these and his wildflower meadows by maintaining the paths between them. He scorned Dutch taste, deploring the fact that "Our Trees rise in Cones, Globes, and Pyra-<lb/>
mids &#x2026; [with] the Marks of the Scissars on every Plant and Bush."<ref target="#CH7-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref> The liberation of the English garden from artifice and constraint in the eighteenth century mirrored, in Addison's mind, the country's freedom from autocratic rule.</p>
<p>Addison recommended to his readers the gar-<lb/>
dens of <name type="place">China</name>, which "conceal the Art by which they direct themselves."<ref target="#CH7-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref> Chinese porcelains were begin-<lb/>
ning to appear in <name type="place">England</name> with the burgeoning of the export trade, and Matteo Ripa's engraved landscape views, reputedly the first illustrations of Chinese gar-<lb/>
dens to reach the West, were in the hands of <name type="pname">Lord Bur-<lb/>
lington</name> after <date when="1724">1724</date>. Addison's recommendation of the apparent artlessness of Chinese gardens as a stimulant to the "Imagination" prodded landowners to new pos-<lb/>
sibilities. Like the "fantastical phenomenon" dis-<lb/>
cussed by <name type="pname">Locke</name> in <hi rend="italic">Some Thoughts on the Conduct of the Understanding in the Search of Truth</hi> (<date when="1690">1690</date>), they provided images and, thereby, a variety of sensory impressions that induced in the mind a state of reverie. Thus, the need arose for a shifting panorama of visual associations to feed the voracious human imagina-<lb/>
tion.<ref target="#CH7-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The ingredients for sensory entertainment of the imagination lay no farther away than the fields and libraries of the great country estates. In reading the ancient Greek and Roman poets, especially Virgil, a rusticating aristocrat could find support for delighting in simple rural scenes, for as Addison remarked, "Vir-<lb/>
gil has drawn together, into his <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, all the pleasing Scenes [that] his Subject is capable of admitting, and in his <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> has given us a Collection of the most delightful Landskips that can be made out of Fields and Woods, Herds of Cattle, and Swarms of Bees."<ref target="#CH7-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The <name type="pname">Whig</name> landowner to whom <name type="pname">Addison</name> and <name type="pname">Pope</name> appealed liked to see himself as a Horace or a Pliny the Younger, a practitioner of an eighteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury version of <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>, the use of rural leisure as an intellectual stimulus, when he returned to his estate after a term in Parliament. His sympathy with classical subjects and appreciation of the relaxed relationship that existed between art and nature in Roman times had been nourished by a receptive reading of the ancient poets and statesmen. The agricultural self-suf-<lb/>
ficiency of Pliny's villas, their function as places of private retirement and social entertainment, their attention to human comfort and scenic prospect&#x2014;all these things inspired an agrarian emphasis in eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century English gardens. This, in turn, influ-<lb/>
enced the emblematic character of garden ornament as numerous statues of <name type="pname">Ceres</name>, <name type="pname">Flora</name>, and <name type="pname">Bacchus</name> took up residence in English fields alongside of those tra-<lb/>
<pb n="235"/>
<pb n="235" type="orig"/>
ditional garden deities, <name type="pname">Pan</name> and <name type="pname">Venus</name>. So compelling was the hold exerted by <name type="place">Rome</name> on the eighteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury English imagination that <name type="pname">Richard Boyle</name>, third earl of Burlington (<date when="1695">1695</date>&#x2013;<date when="1753">1753</date>) financed <name type="pname">Robert Castell</name>'s publication in <date when="1728">1728</date> of <hi rend="italic">Villas of the Ancients</hi>, a recon-<lb/>
struction in plan (somewhat mistakenly along sym-<lb/>
metrical Palladian lines) of Pliny the Younger's two villas, Tusci and Laurentinum.</p>
<p>Because of this sympathy for the poets of the early Roman Empire, the first two decades of the eigh-<lb/>
teenth century in <name type="place">England</name> are sometimes called an Augustan Age. In keeping with his self-image as a latter-day Augustan at the moment in history when <name type="place">England</name> was on the verge of garnering an empire, the <name type="pname">Whig</name> lord's great house was frequently designed in the Palladian style. The simple dignity of this form of classical architecture and its relatively modest scale evoked more effectively the virtues of the antique world than did the more flamboyant and grandiose architecture of the contemporary Baroque style.</p>
<p>An amateur architect and the center of an influ-<lb/>
ential artistic and literary coterie, <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name> cre-<lb/>
ated his villa at <name type="pname">Chiswick</name> as a small-scale version of <name type="pname">Palladio's Villa Rotonda</name> (fig. 7.1). The landscape he created there over a twenty-year period beginning in <date when="1725">1725</date> pioneered the marriage of a symmetrical Palla-<lb/>
dian house with an artfully irregular landscape that nevertheless preserved elements of Continental classi-<lb/>
cal order. Within the garden were winding paths and long perspectival corridors of greenery framing obe-<lb/>
lisks and several small Palladian temples and pavil-<lb/>
ions.</p>
<p>Other <name type="pname">Whig</name> lords were also amateurs in the orig-<lb/>
inal sense of the word: lovers of literature and the arts and sciences. They were students of the classics, trav-<lb/>
elers abroad and connoisseurs of painting, sculpture, and architecture. In addition, they were active on behalf of liberal reform and jealous guardians of recently granted political freedoms (including the freedom to disagree overtly with their government). Owners of large tracts of newly enclosed rural land, they solicited and implemented the advice of their lit-<lb/>
erary mentors. Their patronage of a new generation of designers transformed garden design from an art based on architectural geometry to one based to a large degree on techniques of painterly composition. Their gardens were no longer created with "rule and line," but rather as a painter would compose a subject on a canvas. In them, poetry and history were employed as resources for various thematic itineraries.</p>
<p>As we walk today through some of these now-historic English gardens, it is difficult to remem-<lb/>
ber how filled with associative meaning they were to their first visitors. Indeed, even by the middle of the eighteenth century, as we shall see, general acquain-<lb/>
tance with old mythologies and their imagery was disappearing and the emblematic character of land-<lb/>
scape was being replaced by a less didactic approach to design, one that the garden historian <name type="pname">John Dixon Hunt</name> calls "expressive." This type of garden relied less on such keys to understanding as <name type="pname">Cesare Ripa</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Iconologia: or Moral Emblems</hi> and more completely on nature unadorned, but carefully arranged, for its expressive effect.<ref target="#CH7-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Although we have used the term <hi rend="italic">landscape design</hi> throughout this book to define the professional activ-<lb/>
ity associated with the creation of gardens, parks, and urban plans, the word <hi rend="italic">landscape</hi> as applied this way gained currency only in the eighteenth century. Addi-<lb/>
son led others in using it to imply the arrangement of landscape forms so that they resembled painting. The educated <name type="pname">Whig</name> aristocrats who spearheaded the evo-<lb/>
lution of a naturalistic idiom of gardening in the first decades of the eighteenth century did so in conscious imitation of the landscape paintings they collected. The French seventeenth-century painters <name type="pname">Claude Lor-<lb/>
rain</name> (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1682">1682</date>) and <name type="pname">Nicolas Poussin</name> (<date when="1594">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665">1665</date>) were especially esteemed; <name type="pname">Claude</name> in particular embodied for these lords the spirit of Virgil and a van-<lb/>

<p>Like <name type="pname">Poussin</name>, <name type="pname">Claude</name> had lived and painted in <name type="place">Rome</name>. He painted figures in a half-wild bucolic land-<lb/>

tionship between art and nature, would inspire the design of Stowe and Stourhead, Painshill and Esher Place. These gardens were arranged as theaters of meditation, a series of staged scenes where the human visitor was both spectator and actor. But unlike the theater, where pastoral dramas were enacted before the stationary spectator, here the viewer moved from scene to scene, and the scenes themselves were only allusive settings in which the dramatic action existed solely in the mind of each visitor. Indeed, the human mind itself was the protagonist in these green theaters.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Alexander Pope</name> both promoted the new concept of gardening in print and demonstrated it in his own garden adjacent to his Thames-side villa at Twicken-<lb/>

<p>The English anecdotist <name type="pname">Joseph Spence</name> (<date when="1699">1699</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768">1768</date>), in his <hi rend="italic">Observations, Anecdotes, and Charac-<lb/>
ters of Books and Men</hi>, quotes Pope as saying, "All gardening is landscape-painting. Just like a landscape hung up." Pope maintained this visual approach to poetry as well; his translation of <name type="pname">Homer</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> shows a keen picturesque sensibility as he organizes several memorable scenes in the manner of <hi rend="italic">tableaux vivants</hi>.</p>
<p>Although a <name type="pname">Catholic Tory</name>, <name type="pname">Pope</name> was a friend to the progressive Whigs whose interests he shared. Like other members of <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name>'s coterie, he admired Palladian architecture and was deeply com-<lb/>
mitted to the classical traditions of ancient <name type="place">Rome</name>. Like Addison, he scorned topiary and faulted symmetry because it produced monotony and lack of variety, well-ordered variety being perhaps the single most esteemed trait in Pope's theory of design.</p>
<p>His own garden at Twickenham was famed above all for its remarkable three-chambered grotto, the walls of which were studded with mineral speci-<lb/>
mens, shells, and mirrors to reflect and multiply the view, a place where Pope could engage in reverie, lit-<lb/>
erary pursuit, or conversation with his constant stream of visitors. This grotto was conceived as a dream chamber, a place both to soothe and stimulate the mind. While this eighteenth-century version of a clas-<lb/>
sical <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi>, with its artificial stalactites, imbed-<lb/>
ded minerals, and dripping water, was obviously the height of artifice, Pope was proud to boast that he had "strictly followed Nature" in creating it. And, from his perspective, he was correct. He had eschewed the elaborately artificial hydraulics and arcane mytholog-<lb/>
ical decorative programs of Renaissance grottoes in favor of a more naturalistic cave in which he had arranged his geological specimens so as to simulate a quarry or mine. Pope's grotto was, above all, a highly personal expression, containing associations with the many friends whom he had entertained there and reminding him through its numerous geologic speci-<lb/>
mens of the correspondents who had sent them to him.</p>
<p>Another popular and influential poet, <name type="pname">James Thomson</name> (<date when="1700">1700</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748">1748</date>), saw the English garden as a metaphor for British freedoms. He is remembered for
<pb n="237"/>
<pb n="237" type="orig"/>
his long poem and life work <hi rend="italic">The Seasons</hi>, a paean to British landscape that anticipates Romanticism in its religious attitude toward nature. His reverential awe for nature's bounty and beauty was coupled with the growing pride the English felt in the loveliness of their countryside, particularly as the wave of landscape improvement swept the nation. For Thomson the realm of imagination and the realm of landscape were intertwined. The mind itself was a kind of landscape: "the varied scene of quick-compounded thought," in which "visionary vales," "weeping grottoes," and "prophetic glooms" provoked reflection. It was "the mind's creative eye" that gave meaning to sensation.<ref target="#CH7-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref></p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Landscape Theorists and Practitioners</hi></hi></head>
<p>The philosophy that saw the mind as a theater of sen-<lb/>
sation and therefore landscape experience as a stimu-<lb/>
lus to reflection caused some landed Englishmen to think about their properties in a new way. Ordinary farmland could be ornamented with monuments that evoked sensations, heightening interest and stimulat-<lb/>
ing emotion. A farm could therefore be both practical and poetic. The notion of the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi>, or farm-as-<lb/>
landscape, was first proposed in <name type="place">England</name> by the nurs-<lb/>
eryman and garden designer <name type="pname">Stephen Switzer</name> (c. <date when="1682">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>).<ref target="#CH7-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> His influential volume <hi rend="italic">The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation</hi> of <date when="1715">1715</date> was expanded in <date when="1718">1718</date> into the three-volume <hi rend="italic">Iconographia Rustica</hi>. It was again augmented in a <date when="1742">1742</date> edition with progressive ideas derived from two decades of landscape design development. It is against the back-<lb/>
ground of the enclosure movement that Switzer's pop-<lb/>
ularity and that of later garden theorists and practitioners can be best understood.</p>
<p>Since the waning of the Middle Ages, as <name type="place">Britain</name>'s population swelled and sheep and cattle grazing became a dominant agrarian activity, ancient forestland and inhospitable heath had been converted to hedged fields and pastures, notably in the southern counties. Around certain ancient villages, where there were additional grassy downs for grazing, some of the open fields, which had formerly been held as commons and tilled by allotment, were enclosed by contract agreement. This process of enclosure accelerated in the eighteenth century when more than 3 million acres of arable land were enclosed by acts of Parliament and private treaty as the economic value of improved turf for grazing transformed British agriculture from a community-<lb/>
based system of open-field cultivation and common pasturage to one of private ownership.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, in response to <name type="place">England</name>'s timber famine in the seventeenth century, <name type="pname">John Evelyn</name>'s influential book <hi rend="italic">Sylva</hi> had promoted a tree-planting program, and the reforestation of the countryside in order to increase the production of wood for fuel, ship-<lb/>
building, and other forms of construction was now fully under way. The enclosed lands, a combination of rectangular fields hedged with white hawthorn inter-<lb/>
spersed with ash and elm trees, were called parks. Where foxhunting was a sport, there were occasional copses between the fields. The increased control over water supplies by wealthy owners, who were able to impound it in ponds and pump it through pipes, made possible a far greater independence in the siting of houses than heretofore. This permitted a thorough consideration of the presentation of the residential seat and the views to be enjoyed from its windows. The vast amount of estate improvement attendant upon enclosure effectively transformed the English coun-<lb/>
tryside into the landscape we know today. This tre-<lb/>
mendous beautification effort came at the price of a great deal of human suffering. Enclosure took pastur-<lb/>
age rights away and forced the majority of rural peo-<lb/>
ple to become tenant farmers.</p>
<p>This is the context in which Switzer enthusiasti-<lb/>
cally claimed the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> to be derived from "some of the best Genius's of <name type="place">France</name>," as well as from <name type="place">Rome</name> where it had been proved "the truest and best Way of Gardening in the World, and such as the polit-<lb/>
est and best Genius of all Antiquity delighted in." These were encouraging words for literary and aes-<lb/>
thetically inclined landowners who wanted to incor-<lb/>
porate poetic and painterly sensation into their recently enclosed utilitarian landscapes. But Switzer was, after all, a professional man dependent upon the favor of his clients. As many of these still owned the kind of gar-<lb/>
dens that had been laid out in the French classical tra-<lb/>
dition, he advanced his ideas more cautiously than did the literary advocates and their friends, the <name type="pname">Whig</name> land-<lb/>
owners.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Batty Langley</name> (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751">1751</date>) represents to an even greater degree than Switzer the lingering influ-<lb/>
ence of French classical tradition in <name type="place">England</name>. Arguing for variety and respect for natural landscape features in his <date when="1728">1728</date> <hi rend="italic">New Principles of Gardening</hi>, <name type="pname">Langley</name> nevertheless gives formulaic prescriptions, and his illustrations consist of ornate labyrinthine paths that twirl and squiggle like elegant Rococo exercises within highly regular garden plots. Geometric basins in the French manner form the centerpieces of these curious mazes, and elsewhere in his "grand, beautiful and natural" gardens he advocates broad, straight ave-<lb/>
nues and geometrically shaped lawns. Like Switzer's, his is a how-to book. In appealing to a clientele less educated than the artists, architects, and writers of the Burlington circle, he is concerned less with the poeti-<lb/>
cal values and literary associations of classical sculp-<lb/>
<pb n="238"/>
<pb n="238" type="orig"/>
ture than with the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain mythological figures in relationship to partic-<lb/>
ular kinds of scenery&#x2014;for instance, the correct place-<lb/>
ment of Pomona in the fruit garden, Ulysses near a body of water, <name type="pname">Pan</name> in the grove, Flora in the flower garden, and <name type="pname">Bacchus</name> in the vineyard.</p>
<p>By contrast to <name type="pname">Langley</name>'s simplistic approach by rule rather than by inspiration, <name type="pname">Thomas Whately</name> (d. <date when="1772">1772</date>), a government official writing as a landscape connoisseur in <date when="1765">1765</date>, after landscape had been fully "released &#x2026; from the restraints of regularity," pro-<lb/>
vides both a valuable record of the appearance of some of the important gardens designed in the first half of the eighteenth century and an understanding of the transformation of landscape gardening aesthetics as the century continued. While gardening for the Brit-<lb/>
ish Augustans was an art in which the emblems of classical literature, friendship, family, and nation were important, in <name type="pname">Whately</name>'s day, the deities and heroes could quietly steal away as the expressive qualities of nature's own materials&#x2014;"ground, wood, water, and rocks"&#x2014;became the sole means of composing land-<lb/>
scapes. Though shorn of temples and other symbolic structures, a well-designed landscape could, nonethe-<lb/>
less, evoke a range of moods. <name type="pname">Whately</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</hi> (<date when="1770">1770</date>) helped promote land-<lb/>
scape design as one of the liberal arts. The naturalistic approach it recommended found a receptive audience in <name type="place">France</name>, where this style was known as the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi>. The book was so popular that a second edition was published the same year as the first.</p>
<p>The kind of gardening <name type="pname">Whately</name> advocated was based on the theories <name type="pname">Edmund Burke</name> (<date when="1729">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797">1797</date>) had expounded in <date when="1757">1757</date> in <hi rend="italic">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beau-<lb/>
tiful</hi>. <name type="pname">Burke</name>, as a follower of <name type="pname">Locke</name>, strove to define the correspondences between certain human emotions and particular categories of sensory impression. Sub-<lb/>
limity lay in those scenes that, because of their awe-<lb/>
some size, sharp colors, loud sound, association with the unknown, and often abrupt irregularity, caused sensations best described as a kind of admiring terror or fearful wonder. Beauty, on the other hand excited "the passion of love, or some correspondent affection" and could be found not, as Descartes and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had found it, in mathematical proportion, but rather in such qualities as smallness, smoothness, delicacy, soft hues, melodious music, gently undulating surfaces, and curving lines. For gardeners, this last quality was of the greatest importance, accounting for the almost complete abandonment of straight lines in favor of the continuous S-curve known as Hogarth's line of beauty after <name type="pname">William Hogarth</name> (<date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764">1764</date>), whose treatise on aesthetics, <hi rend="italic">The Analysis of Beauty</hi> (<date when="1753">1753</date>), held that wavy and serpentine lines were inherently pleasing to the eye</p>
<p><name type="pname">Whately</name>'s writing reflected the shift from emblematic to expressive means on the part of contem-<lb/>
porary landscape designers. This was reinforced by a growing belief in the power of ruins to inspire a mood of elegiac melancholy, of dark-toned vegetation to turn the thoughts into paths of somber reflection, of bright green meadows to soothe the agitated soul, of sunny fields reminiscent of harvest revels to raise the spirits to the level of gaiety, of still brooks and placid lakes to speak of peace and serenity, of loud tumbling water-<lb/>
falls to induce a thrilling fear. Water, in particular, was for <name type="pname">Whately</name> a practically indispensable element in the garden. Indeed, according to him, "So various are the characters which water can assume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an impression which it cannot enforce."<ref target="#CH7-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><name type="pname">Whately</name>'s contemporary, <name type="pname">Horace Walpole</name> (<date when="1717">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797">1797</date>), like Pope, enjoyed the charms of a Thames-side villa. Like <name type="pname">Whately</name>, he used his pen to advance the fame of the English garden; between <date when="1771">1771</date> and <date when="1780">1780</date> he wrote the first history of the devel-<lb/>
opment of the new style.<ref target="#CH7-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref> Less theoretical and philo-<lb/>
sophical than <name type="pname">Whately</name>, <name type="pname">Walpole</name> chose to assign the chief credit for the landscape innovations he both practiced and witnessed all around him not to any gen-<lb/>
eral aesthetic evolution but to the imaginative genius of certain individuals, notably <name type="pname">Charles Bridgeman</name> (c. <date when="1680">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) and <name type="pname">William Kent</name> (<date when="1685">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748">1748</date>).</p>
<p><name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> gave practical expression to the ideas of Pope and Addison, retaining some geometrical lines while banishing topiary, turning <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> into lawns, and opening views into the surrounding countryside. He also gave tangible form to the writings of <name type="pname">Stephen Switzer</name>, combining poetical allusions with practical landscapes in the "rural and farm-like way of garden-<lb/>
ing." <name type="pname">Walpole</name> credits <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> with inventing the ha-ha and loosening up the garden's stiff formality. <name type="pname">Kent</name>, however, is his hero. Indeed, <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s lasting renown is due in no small part to <name type="pname">Walpole</name>'s character-<lb/>
ization of him as "painter enough to taste the charms of landscape, bold and opinionative enough to dare and to dictate, and born with a genius to strike out a great system from the twilight of imperfect essays. He leaped the fence and saw that all nature was a gar-<lb/>
den."<ref target="#CH7-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> Some garden authorities now interpret <name type="pname">Walpo-<lb/>
le</name>'s assertions as British chauvinism, an attempt to discredit French seventeenth-century landscape style, which had, in fact, already "leaped the fence" when <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> flung axes toward the distant horizon.<ref target="#CH7-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In addition to substituting techniques of painterly composition for those of architecture, the <name type="pname">Whig</name> patri-<lb/>
ots who championed the new garden style went
<pb n="239"/>
<pb n="239" type="orig"/>
beyond mere reverence for the classicism of ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> to seek inspiration in their own native past, which they conceived as a conflation of Saxon and Gothic legend and history. Just as Pope had been praised for making <name type="pname">Homer</name> "speak good English," so the works of classical antiquity and the Renaissance were given a new grammar. While <name type="pname">Palladio</name>, in effect, was becoming an Englishman as architects gave his style a native inflection, the Society of Antiquaries, formed in <date when="1718">1718</date>, gave new credibility to <hi rend="italic">local</hi> anti-<lb/>
quarian research. In this way such legendary native heroes as <name type="pname">King Alfred</name> acquired new dignity as "wor-<lb/>
thies" in the <name type="pname">Whig</name> political pantheon.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Kent</name>'s work during the <date when="1730">1730</date>s significantly revised the designs of <name type="pname">Charles Bridgeman</name>, which had been considered progressive in the <date when="1720">1720</date>s when his simplified and naturalized versions of the French classical garden were created to complement the boldly theatrical and allusive architecture of <name type="pname">Sir John Vanbrugh</name> (<date when="1664">1664</date>&#x2013;<date when="1726">1726</date>). <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s own importance in the evolving art of landscape design should not be underestimated. His background as a dramatist and his grasp of a site's scenic potential as a setting for works of architecture, together with his considerable talent as an architect, account for his legacy of impressive works. <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name> realized the "roman-<lb/>
tick" qualities of <name type="pname">Claremont</name>, buying the property for his own country retreat and then, in <date when="1711">1711</date>, selling it to <name type="pname">Sir Thomas Pelham Holles</name>, later earl of Clare, who subsequently employed him to design a striking bel-<lb/>
vedere as well as a garden, which he surrounded with high bastion walls. (In order to unite the garden and surrounding fields visually, <name type="pname">Kent</name> later removed and replaced these with a gently curving ha-ha.) <name type="pname">Bridge-<lb/>
man</name>'s most striking contribution to <name type="pname">Claremont</name> was the construction of a large turf amphitheater of con-<lb/>
cave and convex tiers (fig. 7.3).</p>
<p>At <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>, <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name> and <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> collab-<lb/>
orated in the creation of the original landscape. <name type="pname">Van-<lb/>
brugh</name> built the palace and the exceptionally grand neoclassical bridge, and <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> determined the axial lines and principal features of the landscape. At <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>, as at <name type="pname">Claremont</name>, <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name> surrounded the garden with bastionlike walls, but <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> later removed the section around the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> beds. <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s greatest commission came when he was called, probably at <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s suggestion, to design the gardens at Stowe.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s and <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s careers were often intertwined as they worked together or in sequence. <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>, who possessed a technical skill and hor-<lb/>

<p>The sober grandeur of Palladianism, the elevated moral tone of classical ornament, the fascination with real and fabricated ruins, the thematic itineraries of allegorical heroism: it was by these symbolic means that many eighteenth-century upper-class Englishmen invested their country estates with the ideal of their nation as a new <name type="place">Rome</name>. These landscapes became through acts of imagination and arrangement emblematic of the Arca-<lb/>
dian scenery associated with an ancient Golden Age or, more specifically, with the period when the Roman republic was turning toward imperial greatness. Their owners intended them to evoke the paintings by <name type="pname">Claude</name> and <name type="pname">Poussin</name> that hung in the galleries of their great houses. Thus was national ambition wedded to the serenely smiling, architecturally ornamented native landscape in a vision of nature as blessed, beautiful, and peculiarly English yet also Roman, an idyll with a political subtext.</p>

<p>Stowe, the seat of <name type="pname">Richard Temple</name> (<date when="1675">1675</date>&#x2013;<date when="1749">1749</date>), first viscount of <name type="pname">Cobham</name>, was an early and preeminent example of this ideal. Because <name type="pname">Cobham</name> was an influ-<lb/>
ential and vocal <name type="pname">Whig</name> politician and hired landscape designers who mirrored his libertarian values in their transformation of Stowe's grounds from a plan of geometricized regularity to one of naturalistic free-flowing lines, it occupies a place of influence in garden history almost comparable to that of <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name>. Stowe was also a cultural mecca, as visits by the poets Pope and Thomson and the dramatist <name type="pname">Wil-<lb/>
liam Congreve</name> (<date when="1670">1670</date>&#x2013;<date when="1729">1729</date>) attest. As its pioneering position in the development of the new landscape style was quickly realized, Stowe became a favorite stop for eighteenth-century tourists.</p>
<p>With the passage of control of Parliament to the Tories in <date when="1713">1713</date>, <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name> was dismissed from government office. Already, like other rusticated Whigs, he had started to channel his energy into revising the old-fashioned terraced garden adjacent to the original seventeenth-century red-brick house of his ancestors into the most admired and progres-<lb/>
sively modern landscape garden in <name type="place">England</name> as well as the center of <name type="pname">Whig</name> party politics. <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s work there, in association with <name type="pname">Kent</name>, continued until his death in <date when="1738">1738</date>. It shows a masterly and flexible adaptation of axes, boundaries, and architectural fea-<lb/>
tures to the irregularities of the site. <name type="pname">Kent</name>, however, proved to be the bolder collaborator in developing the new direction in landscape design, successfully mediating between older and newer gardening styles. As has already been suggested, in his essay <hi rend="italic">On Mod-<lb/>
ern Gardening</hi>, <name type="pname">Horace Walpole</name> exaggerated in claiming that <name type="pname">Kent</name> "leaped the fence," thereby creat-<lb/>
ing in one bold stroke the naturalistic garden style.<ref target="#CH7-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>An artisan of humble origins and a painter of modest talent, <name type="pname">Kent</name> had an engaging and witty per-<lb/>
sonality, and this made him a likable prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; for <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name> and <name type="pname">Thomas Coke</name>, earl of Leicester. It was as a traveling companion to them that <name type="pname">Kent</name> received his education in architecture and landscape as he visited Florence, Genoa, and the Palladian villas of the Veneto in <date when="1709">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719">19</date>. He was familiar as well with Tivoli, Frascati, and Palestrina outside <name type="place">Rome</name> where he saw such famous ruins as the Temple of Vesta, Hadrian's Villa, and Praeneste, as well as the Villa d'Este, Villa Aldobrandini, and other late-six-<lb/>
teenth- and early-seventeenth-century wonders. The villas of <name type="place">Rome</name> itself, with their works of sculpture, paintings, objects of art, and large hunting parks, pro-<lb/>
vided more stimuli for his impressionable senses. <name type="pname">Kent</name> was also a stage set designer, and as such he recognized and appreciated the theatrical aspects of Italian gardens and their function as places of luxury and sensory delight.</p>
<p>In <date when="1733">1733</date>, <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name> retired permanently from active political life. <name type="pname">Kent</name> was summoned to Stowe to begin its most innovative design phase. This consisted of creating the Elysian Fields in the valley through which had formerly run the road that approached the house from the east. With the road and the village clustered around Stowe Church removed, the valley could be incorporated into the garden as both a demonstration of the new naturalism and a thematic manifestation of political opinion and idealistic patriotism (figs. 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8).</p>
<p>In <date when="1740">1740</date>, young <name type="pname">Lancelot "Capability" Brown</name> found employment at Stowe. <name type="pname">Brown</name>, who soon became head gardener, is thought to have contributed some of his early-blooming talent to the last land-<lb/>
scape completed in <name type="pname">Cobham</name>'s lifetime: the Grecian Valley. The sinuous lines of the valley's tree border complement its gently undulating greensward, giving this part of Stowe a particularly Arcadian effect. The seeming simplicity of this design is, in fact, the result of the same extensive excavation and regrading that characterize <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s later landscape compositions. It is in this impression of serenity and breadth that <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s work is distinguished from <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s, a fact that becomes apparent as we examine <name type="pname">Rousham</name>, <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s finest work and an expression of his genius for compressing a great deal of poetic power into a small compass.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">Rousham</name></hi></hi></head>
<p>As a painter and theater set designer, <name type="pname">Kent</name> thought scenically, not architecturally. Attention to the tonal-<lb/>
ity of vegetation and the effects of perspective achieved through contrasting light and dark foliage; expressive use of evergreens and other trees as screens and as a means of modulating otherwise vapid stretches of lawn; creation of both expectation and surprise by withholding choice prospects from immediate view; and the use of classical (and antique British) structures to enliven the distant scene; juxta-<lb/>
position of the working landscape with the idyllic&#x2014;these were <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s techniques as a designer. At <name type="pname">Rousham</name>, in <name type="place">Oxfordshire</name>, <name type="pname">Kent</name> gave full expression to these painterly concepts of landscape design.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Rousham</name>, which is still owned by the <name type="pname">Dormer</name> family, was the eighteenth-century estate of <name type="pname">Colonel Robert Dormer</name> and his younger brother <name type="pname">James</name>, a lieu-<lb/>
tenant-general. Pope was a friend and correspondent of both brothers and a frequent visitor to <name type="pname">Rousham</name>. <name type="pname">Kent</name>, who was brought to <name type="pname">Rousham</name> by <name type="pname">General Dor-<lb/>
mer</name> following his brother's death in <date when="1737">1737</date>, was com-<lb/>
missioned to develop a garden within the framework of <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s plan of the <date when="1720">1720</date>s. It is likely that <name type="pname">Kent</name> visited <name type="pname">Rousham</name> while he was working at
<pb n="241"/>
<pb n="241" type="orig"/>
Stowe, and he may have collaborated with <name type="pname">Bridge-<lb/>
man</name>, sketching some of the ideas that <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>, with his superior technical ability, subsequently incorporated in the finished plan.</p>
<p>Because of its cramped and highly irregular site, everything depended upon enlarging the garden's apparent extent by, in Pope's words, "calling in the country" beyond the ha-ha. The river <name type="pname">Cherwell</name>, which traverses the property, serves in effect as part of the encompassing ha-ha system, and the bucolic views of the fields lying on its opposite bank were, even in <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s early plan, essential components of <name type="pname">Rousham</name>'s landscape. To these <name type="pname">Kent</name> added a sham ruin, built to resemble a single gabled wall with arches, which rose at the top of a ridge about a mile from the river and was known simply as "the Eye-<lb/>
catcher." Near the river, he restyled an old mill, rechristened the Temple of the Mill, in the Gothic manner to add further picturesque interest to the scene. <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> had already replaced the old ter-<lb/>
raced garden in front of the house with a large rectan-<lb/>
gular bowling green. Its raised borders are defined by ranks of trees channeling the view to the gently roll-<lb/>
ing fields beyond the <name type="pname">Cherwell</name>. <name type="pname">Kent</name> sited <hi rend="italic">Lion Attacking a Horse</hi>, a copy of an antique sculpture, at the end of the bowling green in front of the open slope leading to the river.</p>
<p>The path from the bowling green leads to the narrowest part of the garden facing the river's sharp elbow-bend. Because of the angle cut by the river, the garden is severely pinched at this point, but <name type="pname">Kent</name> cleverly turned a defect into an asset, making this "hinge" the site of his Praeneste Terrace, so named because of his familiarity with the ruined arcades built in tiers on the hillside at Palestrina (ancient Prae-<lb/>
neste) from which his design, abbreviated to a single arcade, took its inspiration. The visitor is invited to tarry here on an elegant stone settee sheltered within one of the niches of the arcade.</p>
<p>West of the Praeneste Terrace, the slope cradles a gentle valley. <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name> had remodeled a series of descending fishponds into a chain of ornamental basins. <name type="pname">Kent</name> reconfigured these when he formed the idyllic Vale of <name type="pname">Venus</name> (fig. 7.4). Beyond the <name type="pname">Venus</name> Vale, in a thickly planted grove of trees, he placed a sinuous rill. This narrow channel forms an elegant wavy line leading the eye from the Octagonal Pond beneath the arched cascade, over which <name type="pname">Venus</name> with her attendant swans and cupids presides, to the Cold Bath, a much smaller octagonal pool reflecting the dappled light of the small glade in which it is set.</p>
<p>From a lower path, there are uphill views of the Vale of <name type="pname">Venus</name>, where <name type="pname">Pan</name> emerges from the trees to spy on <name type="pname">Venus</name>. One can also see the Praeneste Terrace and, beyond the sharp bend in the river, <name type="pname">Bacchus</name>, <name type="pname">Mercury</name>, and <name type="pname">Ceres</name> assembled in a semicircular glade. Although these sculptures evoke the antique world, they do not furnish the garden with as explicit an iconography as that found at Stowe. This may be so because <name type="pname">Kent</name>, by temperament and because he lacked a classical education, hewed to a decorative and scenographic approach to landscape design.</p>
<p>By contrast, there were several aristocratic cognoscenti who wanted to infuse their landscape improvements with literary themes as well as paint-<lb/>
erly perspectives. <name type="pname">Virgil</name>, <name type="pname">Ovid</name>, and <name type="pname">Milton</name> were never far from their minds as they set about this task, nor were the sentiments expressed by their contemporary, Thomson, who wrote the ode "Rule, Britannia." It is not surprising therefore to see in the gardens of these British Augustans patriotic evocations of a new impe-<lb/>
rial Golden Age. In Alberti, whose <hi rend="italic">De re aedificato-<lb/>
ria</hi> was first published in English in <date when="1726">1726</date>, they found a mentor on classical architecture and the amenities of country life. Likewise, they eagerly studied the letters of Pliny the Younger, who had divided his time between affairs of state and the pleasures of fruitful leisure at his country estates. Whether working as their own designers or with professionals to create gardens of heroic allusion&#x2014;which were, in effect, statements of pride in <name type="place">England</name>'s own embarkation upon the course of empire&#x2014;these garden owners took their place in the long tradition of Renaissance humanism.</p>

Here the visitor was given an experience to inspire the noblest patriotic thoughts. As a terminus at the eastern end of the great Cross Walk, which symbolized the route into the imagi-<lb/>

Gazing from the mound upon which it rested, one could see nearby the Temple of Modern Virtue, a sham ruin (now destroyed) bearing a sculpted headless torso, which supposedly represented <name type="pname">Rob-<lb/>

Not without humor, another niche on the back of the temple was sacred to the memory of one Signor Fido, a lamented hunting dog. The bust of Mercury, which adorns the central pyramid, symbolizes the messenger of the gods who will guide these and other wor-<lb/>
thies such as <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name> across the river Styx to take their places in the Ely-<lb/>

<q>The river Styx itself is a small stream issuing from a once-elaborate grotto. <name type="pname">Kent</name> configured it into a chain of serpentine pools by means of a dam, which he dis-<lb/>
guised as the <name type="pname">Shell Bridge <hi rend="bold">D</hi>.</name> Below the bridge, the stream widens into the Wor-<lb/>
thies River. It flows into the Lower River, a serpentine arm of <name type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s Octagon Pond. Here, at the bottom of the Elysian Fields, <name type="pname">Cobham</name> erected a monument to the playwright <name type="pname">William Congreve</name> (<date when="1670">1670</date>&#x2013;<date when="1729">1729</date>). This is a pyramid upon which sits a monkey surveying itself in a mirror, as Congreve held up a comic mirror to the foibles of society.</q>
<q>The Elysian Fields is a relatively inti-<lb/>

cally compressed a great deal of associative meaning. The continuation of <name type="pname">Cobham</name>'s program of improvements to Stowe, and those of his heir and succes-<lb/>

<p>In <date when="1699">1699</date>, at the age of twenty-three, <name type="pname">Charles How-<lb/>
ard</name> became earl of <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> and took possession of his patrimony, a magnificent series of hills and vales sur-<lb/>
rounding old <name type="pname">Henderskelf</name> Castle in <name type="place">North Yorkshire</name>. Discarding a conventional design by the nurseryman <name type="pname">George London</name>, <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> called in <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name> whose robust and theatrical imagination matched his own aspi-<lb/>
rations. They took the then-radical step of conceiving of architecture in relationship to scenery, allowing the site to dictate the location of the new house parallel to, rather than on axis with, the approach road (fig. 7.10). As at Stowe, the creators of <name type="pname">Castle Howard</name>'s landscape destroyed a village without apparent remorse as the Anglo-Palladian great house with its magnificent cupola, the first of its kind in <name type="place">England</name>, took command of the sweeping view to the south.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the eastern flank of the house rose a dome-shaped hill known as Wray Wood where between <date when="1718">1718</date> and <date when="1732">1732</date>, possibly with advice from Switzer, <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> boldly conceived a plan of meandering paths and various fountains set within a naturalistic planta-<lb/>
tion of trees. Bisecting a stately north-south approach road about 500 yards (457 meters) west of the house, a cross avenue carried one past the entrance court to a terminus at the edge of Wray Wood. At the intersection of these two straight avenues, an obelisk (<date when="1714">1714</date>) com-<lb/>
memorates the duke of Marlborough; framing it, far-<lb/>
ther south, is the massive Pyramid Gate (<date when="1719">1719</date>) (fig. 7.11). <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s park wall, with its castellated and proto-Romantic gothicism, reminds us of the medieval origins of this eighteenth-century country seat as <hi rend="italic">Cas-<lb/>
tle</hi> <name type="pname">Howard</name>. Farther south, at the entrance to the great avenue, <name type="pname">Nicholas Hawksmoor</name>'s (<date when="1661">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1736">1736</date>) <name type="pname">Carrmire Gate</name> (<date when="1730">1730</date>), with its crenellated extension ending in a turreted round tower, elaborated the medieval theme.</p>
<p>As at Stowe, where modified tradition leapt to pure innovation, here, too, a choice was made to aban-<lb/>
don rectilinear design in favor of scenic composition. <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> turned the old lane below Wray Wood, which had led to the now-destroyed village of <name type="pname">Henderskelf</name>, into Terrace Walk, a broad grassy path with a scenic terminus in <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s Temple of the Four Winds (fig. 7.12). This structure was modeled upon <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s Villa Rotonda. To the east of the Temple of the Four Winds, <name type="pname">Hawksmoor</name>'s majestic Mausoleum, a domed rotunda with a Doric colonnade set upon a massive square plat-<lb/>
form surmounting a small knoll, gives solemn dignity to the landscape. In the middle distance, between the Temple of the Four Winds and the Mausoleum, a Pal-<lb/>
ladian bridge of about <date when="1744">1744</date> spans the serpentine river whose bed had been excavated through the fields, giv-<lb/>
ing additional classical character to the picturesque scene.</p>

<p>Although the breathtaking scope, scale, and expense of his enterprise set him apart and made <name type="pname">Castle Howard</name> unique among English landscapes, <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> represents the Augustan amateur landscape improvers in his sin-<lb/>
gle-minded pursuit of landscape perfection as his life-<lb/>
work and personal monument, as well as in the lofty idealism that allied his enterprise with national ambi-<lb/>
tion. On a much smaller scale, though as absorbing to their owners, were The Leasowes, the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> of <name type="pname">William Shenstone</name> (<date when="1714">1714</date>&#x2013;<date when="1763">1763</date>), and Woburn Farm, the estate of <name type="pname">Philip Southcote</name> (<date when="1698">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758">1758</date>). At other country seats, owners were stirred to a new apprecia-<lb/>
tion of the moldering relics of <name type="place">England</name>'s abandoned monasteries, notably at Duncombe Park and <name type="pname">Studley Royal</name>. At Duncombe, a broad, gently curving grass terrace was built to capture the view of Rievaulx Abbey, whereas at <name type="pname">Studley Royal</name>, <name type="pname">John Aislabie</name> con-<lb/>
nected his geometrically arranged water garden by a wooded walk to a romantically contrived view of Fountains Abbey, where some parts of the buildings date from the twelfth century (figs. 7.13, 7.14).</p>
<p>At Painshill in Surrey, <name type="pname">Charles Hamilton</name> (<date when="1704">1704</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786">1786</date>) proved to be another enthusiastic amateur caught up in the passion of landscape improvement. Between <date when="1738">1738</date>, when he obtained a crown lease for the property, and <date when="1773">1773</date>, when indebtedness forced him to sell it, he created an undulating circuit beside a fourteen-acre artificial lake. Visitors following it had views of Rococo features similar to those employed in contem-<lb/>
porary French gardens: a Gothic-style "temple," a sham ruin of an abbey, an elaborate grotto, a rustic her-<lb/>
mitage, a cascade, a Roman mausoleum, a Turkish tent, a Temple of <name type="pname">Bacchus</name>, and a Chinese bridge. <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> was responsible for importing many exotic plant spe-<lb/>
cies from <name type="place">North America</name> and was one of the first Englishmen to use rhododendrons. After he went bank-<lb/>

<p>Landscape building on the Augustan scale was expen-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Henry Hoare II</name> was only nineteen when he suc-<lb/>
ceeded his father as the head of the family's Fleet Street bank. From <date when="1738">1738</date> until his mother's death in <date when="1741">1741</date>, he traveled in <name type="place">Italy</name>, educating himself in the scenery of antiquity and purchasing paintings by sev-<lb/>
enteenth- and early-eighteenth-century masters, including two by <name type="pname">Poussin</name> and one by <name type="pname">Claude</name>. When he returned, he took up residence as the master of Stourhead, and shortly after he became a widower in <date when="1743">1743</date>, he began a program of garden improvements, an enterprise that lasted the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The garden historian <name type="pname">Kenneth Woodbridge</name> has made a convincing case for <name type="pname">Hoare</name>'s use of the text of Virgil's <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> as the programmatic theme of Stour-<lb/>
head.<ref target="#CH7-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> The circuit made by the visitor can be inter-<lb/>
preted as a series of stations evoking Aeneas's journey from Troy to his founding of <name type="place">Rome</name>, an odyssey that might have symbolized for <name type="pname">Henry Hoare II</name> his estab-<lb/>
lishing a family seat at Stourhead. Whether or not a specific iconographic program was in his mind, <name type="pname">Hoare</name> clearly meant the landscape of Stourhead to be a dreamworld inhabited by the gods, goddesses, and heroes of antiquity.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Henry Flitcroft</name> (<date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1769">1769</date>) was <name type="pname">Hoare</name>'s archi-<lb/>
tect for this and several other projects. He advised and helped <name type="pname">Hoare</name> plan the dam to flood the valley and enlarge its existing ponds into a lake. At the head of the lake, the Temple of Flora (<date when="1744">1744</date>; originally Ceres) bears over its portal the injunction of the Cumaean Sibyl in the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> warning Aeneas as he prepares to enter the underworld where his future as founder of <name type="place">Rome</name> will be revealed to him. Other architectural features along the path leading counterclockwise around the lake had to be built before the dam could impound the waters at the head of the Stour and give them their intended setting. Shelving banks for the future lake had to be built as well, a task that contin-<lb/>
ued until the dam's construction in <date when="1753">1753</date>. At the same time, <name type="pname">Hoare</name> began planting contrasting masses of light- and dark-toned trees against each other in the manner of Pope and <name type="pname">Kent</name>. A wooden bridge, the design of which was derived from a drawing by <name type="pname">Pal-<lb/>
ladio</name>, earned the circuit path around to the grotto over the northern arm of the lake.</p>
<p>Beyond the grotto, over the entrance to which is an inscription that alludes to the nymph-inhabited cave near Carthage where Aeneas sought refuge with his men, the path leads toward a visionary scene that bears an obvious relationship to <hi rend="italic">Coast View of Delos with Aeneas</hi>, a painting by <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name> (fig. 7.15). This painting depicts Aeneas with his father, his son, and Anius the priest standing on a terrace in front of a Doric temple, gazing at a landscape containing a round temple modeled on <name type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Pantheon in <name type="place">Rome</name>. In the Virgilian text upon which the painting is based, a travel-weary Aeneas has been praying to Apollo to grant him and his descendants a home by allowing him to fulfill his destiny by founding <name type="place">Rome</name>. <name type="pname">Hoare</name>'s Pantheon, built according to Flitcroft's design as a miniaturized version of the Roman one, is the visual and symbolical focus of the Stourhead land-<lb/>
scape (fig. 7.16).</p>
<p>Across the lake, on axis with the Pantheon, <name type="pname">Hoare</name> built a stone bridge patterned after a design by <name type="pname">Palladio</name>. In the opposite direction, toward the village, was a view of the Bristol High Cross, which marked the principal intersection of that city before it was declared an obstruction and dismantled. In <date when="1764">1764</date>, <name type="pname">Hoare</name> acquired its disassembled pieces from an English cathedral where they had been lying in a cor-<lb/>
ner. This historic trophy blends with the mellow medievalism of the village and reinforces the gar-<lb/>
den's iconographic alliance between the glories of
<pb n="247"/>
<pb n="247" type="orig"/>
classical antiquity and the British cultural heritage.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Henry Hoare</name>'s grandson, <name type="pname">Richard Colt Hoare</name>, the heir and master of Stourhead after <date when="1780">1780</date>, broad-<lb/>
ened the garden's palette of plant material as an increasing number of exotic species began to be naturalized in <name type="place">England</name>. He was an avid plantsman and a member of the Linnean Society, who planted many of the mature ornamental trees and some of the huge old rhododendrons one sees today. Like his forebears, he lived for a considerable time in <name type="place">Italy</name> where his talents as a draftsman and watercolorist flourished and his purchases increased the number of fine paintings in the house. An antiquarian and therefore something of an architectural purist, he removed Stourhead's Turkish Tent, Venetian Seat, and Chinese Alcove, garden features his grandfa-<lb/>
ther had added when such Rococo eclecticism was fashionable. At the same time, in <date when="1806">1806</date>, he gave the small cottage between the grotto and the Pantheon a Picturesque Gothic porch.</p>
<p>In removing elements he considered extrane-<lb/>
ous and developing the garden at Stourhead no lon-<lb/>
ger as a contrived sequence of emblematic associations but rather as an overall scenic idyll, Colt <name type="pname">Hoare</name> followed the taste of his time. The perception of the world in terms of Lockean sensibility was gradually giving way to the less intellectual set of values that formed the seedbed of Romanticism. His broad simplification of his grandfather's original plan and the use of natural materials as the principal expressive force in landscape design paralleled the work at Stowe that was being carried out by <name type="pname">Richard Grenville</name>, <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name>'s nephew and heir.</p>
<p>Stowe, with Grenville's simplifications and noble additions, such as the Grecian Temple, mod-<lb/>
eled on the Maison Carr&#x00E9;e, the Roman temple at N&#x00EE;mes, long remained the epitome of English Augus-<lb/>
tan garden style, an international cynosure visited by the <name type="pname">Empress Catherine</name> the Great, <name type="pname">Jean-Jacques Rous-<lb/>
seau</name>, <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>, and many others. But already the allusive garden of humanistic and heroic messages was a thing of the past, and although its style and features would be imitated on the Continent in years to come, in <name type="place">England</name> its function as a model was over.</p>
<p>In the last third of the eighteenth century, when parliamentary acts of enclosure were creating a vast number of new estates, prosperous British landown-<lb/>
ers were less interested in making neoclassical Arca-<lb/>
dias than in achieving a series of pleasing views as they toured their acres or gazed at them from their country houses.<ref target="#CH7-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref> Thus it was that the remaking of the rural landscape of <name type="place">England</name> fell into the hands of the untraveled, relatively uneducated, yet immensely capable <name type="pname">Lancelot Brown</name>.</p>

<p>British mercantile policies in the middle of the eigh-<lb/>

After <date when="1780">1780</date>, the Industrial Revolution accelerated dramatically. This process was assisted both by the invention of new production machinery and by the availability of an industrial labor force following enclosure when many tenant farmers were uprooted from the land. While <name type="place">England</name> felt the nascent surge of industrial capitalism, and its cities were beginning to increase significantly in pop-<lb/>
ulation, it was still a preindustrial country. Its wealth was based upon a greatly expanded domestic and international trade, together with a more productive animal husbandry and agriculture than had heretofore been practiced. This wealth provided the substance with which to carry out the transformation of the eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century English countryside. By most accounts, the country was fortunate in having at hand a talented individual who felt himself capable of reshaping many estates so that they expressed the new agrarian prosperity in terms of an entirely "English" ideal.</p>

<p>The <name type="place">England</name> into which <name type="pname">Lancelot "Capability" Brown</name> (<date when="1716">1716</date>&#x2013;<date when="1783">1783</date>) was born grew with him into a confi-<lb/>
dent, optimistic, and prosperous maturity. <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s considerable achievement lay in his ability to create designs that were abstract and yet harmonious with the scenery of rural enclosure. His nickname Capabil-<lb/>
ity, from his frequent assurance to his clients that their properties had the <hi rend="italic">capability</hi> of being rendered beau-<lb/>
tiful by their expenditures and his improving hand, expresses succinctly the flavor of the enterprise. Between the time he left his position as head gardener at Stowe in <date when="1751">1751</date> and his death in <date when="1783">1783</date>, he had designed or redesigned nearly two hundred proper-<lb/>
ties, and his advice had been sought on many others. He traveled tirelessly from one to another of his com-<lb/>
missions. The often-narrated anecdote about <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s turning down a job in <name type="place">Ireland</name> with the excuse that he had not finished <name type="place">England</name> yet is more than humorous: His vision was a grandly optimistic one in which he must have seen all of <name type="place">England</name> re-created as idealized rural scenery. <hi rend="italic">Taste</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi>&#x2014;operative
<pb n="248"/>
<pb n="248" type="orig"/>
words in the eighteenth century&#x2014;were, along with the financial resources necessary to activate them, all that seemed required to achieve this desirable end. The garden, which since the seventeenth century had been expanding visually to embrace spaces beyond its borders, was, in <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s terms, all of a piece with this larger landscape; a garden was simply a rural working landscape arranged so as to be at once productive and beautiful.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s style, stripped of association, was in its own way as abstractly classical as that of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, and the volume of earth movement and topographical regrading required to achieve his seemingly naturalis-<lb/>
tic results was no less monumental than that required by the French master. <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s eye was selective; it edited out the blemishes of nature, smoothing away abrupt contours and camouflaging its "accidents" with screening foliage. He was often referred to as a "land-<lb/>
scape improver,"<ref target="#CH7-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> and with the unconscious pre-<lb/>
sumption of a deity he set about <hi rend="italic">correcting</hi> nature to conform with an aesthetic ideal, which the poet Thom-<lb/>
son hailed as "purest truth." Although <name type="pname">Brown</name> left no written theory, he undoubtedly believed that through rational science landscape could be perfected to a state wherein human beings and nature could meet on equal terms, in fruitful partnership.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, other things were necessary as well, and in this regard <name type="pname">Brown</name> came to his profession far better prepared than <name type="pname">Kent</name>. Although <name type="pname">Brown</name> spent his youth in the small <name type="place">Northumberland</name> village of Kirkharle where he was born, he was able to observe the estate improvement occurring in the immediate vicinity. His walk to school in Cambo took him past Wallington Park, which, after enclosure, was enjoying various improving alterations to its previ-<lb/>
ously barren and degraded landscape. These included the kind of large-scale reforestation and hedgerow planting ubiquitous in <name type="place">England</name> at the time. In <date when="1732">1732</date>, after leaving school, he became a gardener at Kirkharle Hall where <name type="pname">Sir William Loraine</name> was creating a similar working landscape. Here <name type="pname">Brown</name> learned to drain swamps and acquired a practical knowledge of horti-<lb/>
culture. It was with these skills that he left home, in <date when="1739">1739</date>, for <name type="place">Oxfordshire</name> in the south, finding employ-<lb/>
ment first at Kiddington Hall and then, two years later, at Stowe.</p>
<p>It was <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s lucky exposure to <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s recent work in the Elysian Fields at Stowe that broadened his aesthetic horizons, while his employment by <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name> allowed him to expand his professional abili-<lb/>
ties. Surveying, hydraulic engineering, and architecture were skills he readily acquired. He became sufficiently competent as a draftsman to develop plans for various neighboring estates, whose owners soon sought his services. Site planning came easily to him, and he quickly found himself not only recommending the placement of various manor houses but designing them as well. Within the bounds of a conventional Palladi-<lb/>
anism, he provided his clients with mansions and gar-<lb/>
den buildings that were remarkable for their sound construction, comfort, and convenience.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Brown</name> was probably familiar with the aesthetics of landscape from an intellectual perspective and referred to his design activity as "Place-making."<ref target="#CH7-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref> In <date when="1753">1753</date>, <name type="pname">William Hogarth</name> (<date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764">1764</date>) published <hi rend="italic">An Analysis of Beauty</hi>, a book devoted to a minute analy-<lb/>
sis of the way in which that quality is to be found in the sinuous, rather than the straight, line. The first of several editions of <name type="pname">Edmund Burke</name>'s treatise <hi rend="italic">A Philo-<lb/>
sophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</hi> appeared in <date when="1757">1757</date>. In it <name type="pname">Burke</name> set forth his concept of beauty as a "feminine" ideal composed of smoothness and softly rounded contours. He elaborated this definition in sensuous terms, liken-<lb/>
ing beauty to the charm "of being swiftly drawn in an easy coach on a smooth turf, with gradual ascents and declivities,"<ref target="#CH7-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref> the intention thus being to produce a pleasing and harmoniously varied experience.</p>
<p>Whether or not <name type="pname">Brown</name> was a student of <name type="pname">Burke</name> and Hogarth in a conscious sense, their ideas were part of a Rococo aesthetic found in mid-eighteenth-century Georgian design, as characterized by the flowing lines and naturalistic forms of <name type="pname">Thomas Chippendale</name>'s fur-<lb/>
niture. It is not surprising, therefore, that <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s style was based upon an undulating linearity of ground plane edges, combined with rounded topographic modeling. <name type="place">Southern England</name> naturally offers just such gentle and varied beauty as that recommended by <name type="pname">Burke</name>'s definition, making the improver's art there merely one of emphasis. Thus, by rearranging certain landscape elements, <name type="pname">Brown</name> was readily able to achieve compositions that met <name type="pname">Burke</name>'s criteria for the beauti-<lb/>
ful.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Brown</name>, having discarded the emblematic garden, expressed mood through more abstract means than temples, monuments, and inscriptions. "Solemn" groves provided variety and contrast to "cheerful" fields. Placid sky-reflecting water was used almost invariably to bring an air of tranquil repose to the scene. Although he was described as working with "the Poet's feeling" and "the Painter's eye," <name type="pname">Brown</name> attempted neither to evoke Virgil nor render a three-di-<lb/>
mensional painting by <name type="pname">Claude</name>. By contrast, the very Englishness of his landscapes inspired poetry and themselves became the subjects of paintings by such British artists as <name type="pname">John Constable</name> (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>) and <name type="pname">John Mallord William Turner</name> (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>).</p>
<p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s work displays a strong plastic sensibil-<lb/>
ity. He achieved the smoothness that <name type="pname">Burke</name> prized by extensive regrading and by removing all rough obsta-<lb/>
<pb n="249"/>
<pb n="249" type="orig"/>
cles and "accidental" defects from the terrain. The resulting topography is never flat nor monotonously sloping in one direction, but shaped to form a series of gentle convex and concave curves. Where a slope meets a level plane of lawn or water, <name type="pname">Brown</name> created a soft tangential curve called a "concave scoop," and many of his finest views appear as long dells with higher ground softly swelling on either side (fig. 7.17). Trees are never planted in ranks, but rather in clumps, belts, and screens that partially reveal more distant prospects. He used both deciduous and evergreen native species for the most part, following <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s practice of contrasting light and dark foliage in order to realize effects of perspective. The curving lines of his drives, tree belts, and lake edges never run along parallel courses, but in harmonious naturalistic con-<lb/>
figurations.</p>
<p>His ha-has, placed at right angles to the line of vision, ensure that these sunk fences are imperceptible to the eye traveling to the fields beyond, and their sides slope gradually so as to permit cattle to browse at their edges, thereby eliminating obtrusive tufts of spiky veg-<lb/>
etation. Deer still graze in several of his parks, crop-<lb/>
ping the grass, and by clearing the lower branches of the trees up to a uniform line, they make possible long views through the woods.</p>
<p>A necessary component of <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s landscapes was an element of suspense. The same kind of hide-<lb/>
and-reveal tactics that we will discern when we exam-<lb/>
ine Japanese gardens can also be recognized in his. The belts of trees, designed to screen his circuit drives, some working fields, and other "eyesores" were planned with gaps to expose those aspects of the agri-<lb/>
cultural landscape that harmonized with his designs. His walks and drives were designed to entice carriage rides and perambulation, and his broad lakes invited visual exploration, but he never allowed eye and body to traverse the same route. Straight lines do not exist in <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s compositions, and it is only by means of a leisurely circuitous amble that one gains the object in view. As at Stourhead, his parks are meant to be trav-<lb/>
eled on foot or, more likely, considering their scale, by carriage, but unlike <name type="pname">Hoare</name>'s lakeside route at Stour-<lb/>
head with its Virgilian features, <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s tours are not thematic; they attempt merely to stir human emotions rather than the intellect.</p>
<p>Capability <name type="pname">Brown</name> demonstrated his greatest skill in his thorough knowledge of drainage techniques and handling of water (fig. 7.18). The gentle transition between ground plane and water surface ensured an effect of maximum reflectivity, as one does not look down into his water from above, but rather across it. By making the contours of his lakes irregular and obscuring their curving ends in the shadows of dense plantings, or screening them with foreground islands, he was able to add an air of mystery to his scenery. <name type="pname">Brown</name> also was a master builder of naturalistic cas-<lb/>
cades, and these provided additional variety and some-<lb/>
thing approaching Romantic excitement within his otherwise tranquil compositions.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s landscapes were ones in which the mar-<lb/>

ant. It was necessary that the view from the house be a controlled one, extending all the way to the horizon. If this was not possible, anything extraneous was excluded from sight by screens of trees. The siting of the house to best advantage and its status as the

<p>Like <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, <name type="pname">Brown</name> was blessed with a pleas-<lb/>
ing personality, and from his home at Hammersmith, a center of the nursery trade outside <name type="place">London</name>, he trav-<lb/>
eled throughout the countryside, particularly in the counties of Wiltshire and Hampshire, to undertake commissions both large and small. He could not have done all this without a strong administrative ability, which enabled him to subcontract work, perform on time and within budget, and obtain critical decisions from clients whom he visited personally during the course of a job.</p>
<p>His genius and ability to implement a bold vision were nowhere better expressed than at <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>, where his landscape plan was allied with <name type="pname">Sir John Van-<lb/>
brugh</name>'s robustly masculine, dramatic architecture (fig. 7.19). A gift to the duke of Marlborough after his vic-<lb/>
tory against the French at the <date when="1704">1704</date> Battle of <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>, <name type="pname">Blenheim</name> Palace was built to serve both as a country seat and national monument. Its bastion-shaped gar-<lb/>
dens, with <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> by <name type="pname">Henry Wise</name> and a mile-long triumphal avenue from the Column of Victory to the palace&#x2014;which was carried over the river Glyme by <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s massive bridge&#x2014;provided the canvas for <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s artistic labors when he was summoned there by the fourth duke in <date when="1764">1764</date>.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> were soon swept away but <name type="pname">Brown</name> retained the great triumphal avenue. His master stroke was to dam the Glyme, thereby flooding the lower piers of <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s bridge. This brought the water into scale with the bridge, lessening the bridge's impact as an isolated and somewhat pompous artifact in relation to the meager Glyme. <name type="pname">Brown</name> demonstrated as well his considerable hydrological skill in being able to assess and control its exact level. The upper parts of the bridge's arches, which remain above the level of the water, unite with their reflections in the lake to form pleasing geometries, and the bridge itself is perfectly proportioned to the lake (fig. 7.20). Upon entering <name type="pname">Blenheim</name> Park from the village of Woodstock, the vis-<lb/>
itor sees this dreamlike vision: the land sloping more steeply than usual in <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s landscapes down to the lake, the lovely bridge made poetic by the addition of a small island in front of it, and on axis with the bridge, the palace set upon its commanding plateau.</p>

<p>Success breeds enmity, and <name type="pname">Brown</name> had his detractors, the most virulent of whom was <name type="pname">Sir William Chambers</name>. <name type="pname">Chambers</name>, who had visited <name type="place">China</name> in <date when="1744">1744</date> and <date when="1748">1748</date>, set himself up as an authority on what he declared to be, quite fancifully, the Chinese taste in gardening.

dens and Waters at Hampton Court. The eigh-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Chambers</name>'s implementation of his notions of Chinese taste at Kew resulted in unbridled eclecticism. There he built a menagerie, an aviary, a "mosque," more than twenty classical temples, a Palladian bridge, a Chinese temple, a ten-story pagoda, and a Roman triumphal arch in ruins (fig. 7.21). Of this array, only the last two features remain. Notwithstanding royal patronage, <name type="pname">Chambers</name>'s ideas found a more congenial soil in which to germinate in <name type="place">France</name> and elsewhere on the Continent than at home. By contrast, <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s less theatrical landscape style gained fewer adherents abroad than in his native <name type="place">England</name> where an aesthetic appreciation of tranquil agrarian beauty was well established. As we shall see, enthusiasm for <name type="pname">Cham-<lb/>

<p>At <name type="pname">Claremont</name>, <name type="pname">Brown</name> and <name type="pname">Chambers</name> met as rivals when <name type="pname">Lord Clive</name>, who had recently bought the estate, invited both men to submit designs for a new mansion. <name type="pname">Clive</name>'s choice of <name type="pname">Brown</name> to work in col-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s abstract and nonliterary approach to landscape was fundamentally contrary to that of such scene makers as <name type="pname">Henry Hoare</name>, who worked as a lat-<lb/>

<p>In our age of adventure travel, packaged sight-seeing, and resort vacations, it is difficult to comprehend the seriousness of eighteenth-century tourists, their careful characterization of different categories of scenery, and the finely wrought discriminations they made among them. Readers of <name type="pname">Jane Austen</name>'s novels can appreciate the intensity of the aesthetic debate within polite society during this period of active transformation of the English landscape. The fervor with which this discus-<lb/>
sion of the appropriateness of a particular landscape style was conducted at that time appears comically quaint in our own when design diversity has itself become a cultural value. Vast social changes, carried by swift currents of history even as these debates occurred, soon made the practice of landscape design a public responsibility rather than a private entertainment, and the arguments over the respective merits of the Pictur-<lb/>
esque style versus the smoothly undulating landscapes of <name type="pname">Brown</name> came to seem no more consequential than a spirited difference of opinion within a gentlemen's club. But club arguments can assume a degree of rancor that divides people into ardent factions, and the charges and countercharges that are hurled in the heat of battle sometimes echo for years after their participants are gone.</p>
<p>The Picturesque controversy was taken up by the periodicals of the day, after which it became table talk in country houses throughout the land. This was so because people had begun to regard sight-seeing as a delightful form of recreation. Carriage travel had
<pb n="252"/>
<pb n="252" type="orig"/>
become relatively convenient and safe, but revolution in <name type="place">France</name> and other political disturbances made tourist excursions on the Continent difficult. Many people were therefore eager to have their eyes opened to the charms of native scenery. Instructing them in this regard and instilling in them a new concept of region-<lb/>
alism and a new approach to the aesthetics of the nat-<lb/>
ural landscape were the works of <name type="pname">William Gilpin</name>.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">William Gilpin</name>, Vicar of Boldre</hi></hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">William Gilpin</name> (<date when="1724">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804">1804</date>), who was brought up in the north of <name type="place">England</name> beside the Scottish border, was an early admirer of wilder and more rugged land-<lb/>
scapes than those of southern <name type="place">England</name>. Tutored by his father in painting and sketching, he instinctively viewed landscape as artistic subject matter wherein craggy topography and a certain roughness of objects provided greater variety and visual interest than smooth and flowing perfection. His discriminating eye led him to an appreciation of the different varieties of natural scenery as one traveled from one section of <name type="place">England</name> to another. As developed by <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>, the term <hi rend="italic">Picturesque</hi> did not apply to gardens, which "want the bold roughness of nature," and were therefore uninter-<lb/>
esting subjects for painters. For him, <hi rend="italic">Picturesque</hi> meant scenery that because of its boldly projecting outcrops of rock, contrasts of dark and light, compo-<lb/>
sitional grouping of trees, and other such attributes was either naturally suitable for picture making or, with some compositional correction to foreground, background, or middle ground, could be made so. His appreciation of scenery was as a two-dimensional framed view of a three-dimensional scene, and his visual satisfaction depended on a correspondence between the works of nature and the animated "rough-<lb/>
ness" of elements and the atmospheric light and shade that give pleasure in a painting. <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>'s imagination, therefore, was not excited by wild nature as such, but rather by nature as seen through the filter of art.</p>
<p>His own talent as a sketchbook artist admirably served his purposes as a travel writer and illustrator of a new and popular way of looking at landscape.</p>

When the dreary heath is spread before the eye, and ideas of wildness and desolation are required, what more suitable accompaniment can be imagined, than the blasted oak, ragged, scathed and leafless; shooting its peeded, white branches athwart the gathering blackness of some rising storm?"</figDesc>

<p>As a young clergyman living in <name type="place">London</name>, he visited Stowe, and in <date when="1748">1748</date>, he published anonymously <hi rend="italic">A Dia-<lb/>
logue upon the Gardens of the Right Honourable the <name type="pname">Lord Viscount Cobham</name>, at Stow in Buckinghamshire</hi>. In this "conversation" between Callophilus, a lover of beauty, and Polython, a man of sensitivity and imagi-<lb/>
nation from the north of <name type="place">England</name>, he analyzed the famous landscape as if it were a painting. Stowe's defi-<lb/>
ciency in <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>'s nonetheless admiring eye was its want of Picturesque scenery such as one found in the northern counties where craggy precipices, foaming waterfalls, hanging woods, and other scenes of rough natural beauty abounded. He held that "Regularity and Exactness excite no manner of Pleasure in the Imagi-<lb/>
nation. The fancy is struck by <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> alone; and if <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> does any thing more than just decently improve her, we think she grows impertinent. Thus a regular ragged ruin, beautifully set off with Light and Shade, and gar-<lb/>
nished with flourishing bushes, Ivy, and dead Branches, may afford a great deal."<ref target="#CH7-n25"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">25</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The growing appreciation of wild scenery, as well as the currency that the word <hi rend="italic">picturesque</hi> gained and continued to enjoy for a century or more as part of the vocabulary of landscape viewing, was due in no small measure to <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>'s influence. Yet, his career as an artist-tourist was, in fact, written in the margins of his life as a busy schoolmaster and vicar attending his needy rural parishioners.</p>
<p>Like Pope, who had employed his summers in traveling for scenic enjoyment, <name type="pname">Gilpin</name> toured the countryside during his vacations as headmaster of Cheam School. He revisited those wild landscapes that had thrilled him as a youth, and he happily spent his days sketching and his evenings writing up his "obser-<lb/>
vations," which were based on an analysis, according to his developing theories of Picturesque beauty, of the scenery he had drawn. He circulated these observa-<lb/>
tions along with sketches from his travels in Wales, the Lake District, and elsewhere in northern <name type="place">England</name> to a growing band of admirers.</p>
<p>In <date when="1776">1776</date>, he left Cheam School to become the vicar of Boldre, a parish in Hampshire on the border of the New Forest beside the southern coast of <name type="place">England</name>. There he deepened his appreciation of forest scenery and accumulated sketches and remarks on the diverse qualities of picturesqueness to be found in various spe-<lb/>
cies of trees (fig. 7.22). <name type="pname">Gilpin</name> realized at this time that he would be able to derive income beyond that of his clerical living from the publication of the observations and sketches made on his tours. <name type="pname">Horace Walpole</name> helped him find a way to mitigate the financial risk of publish-<lb/>

<p>In <date when="1782">1782</date>, <name type="pname">Gilpin</name> decided to publish one of his shorter accounts, <hi rend="italic">Observations on the River Wye</hi>, with aquatints made by his nephew <name type="pname">William Sawrey Gilpin</name> (<date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>).

<p>These books enjoyed a huge popular success and saw a heavy circulation from lending libraries for many years following their publication. "And when was the public eye ever instructed by the pen and pen-<lb/>

Both poets and prose writers began analyzing scenery in terms of the Picturesque, so much so that the excesses of the fashion were soon being satirized by some, including <name type="pname">Jane Austen</name>, who, nevertheless, was a con-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Gilpin</name>'s writings, which were translated into French and German, became revered texts both for scenic tourists and landscape gardeners. <name type="pname">Frederick Law Olmsted</name> (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903">1903</date>), the future designer of Central Park, remembered that the extended carriage tours he took through the Connecticut countryside with his father and stepmother as a boy were "really tours in search of the picturesque." He had read <hi rend="italic">Remarks on Forest Scenery</hi> in the Hartford Public Library, and it later served him as a professional tool. He put the book in the hands of his pupils, along with <name type="pname">Sir Uvedale Price</name>'s <hi rend="italic">On the Picturesque</hi>, with the instruction "to read these seriously, as a student of law would read Blackstone." <name type="pname">Henry Thoreau</name> and <name type="pname">Oliver Wendell Holmes</name> also counted themselves among <name type="pname">Gil-<lb/>
pin</name>'s American admirers.</p>
<p>With regard to landscape design, <name type="pname">Gilpin</name> felt that roughness, or ruggedness, "observable in the smaller, as well as in the larger parts of nature&#x2014;in the outline, and bark of a tree, as in the rude summit, and craggy sides of a mountain"<ref target="#CH7-n27"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">27</hi></hi></ref> provided sufficient visual interest to serve the painter and that these qualities should be prized by the landscape improver as well. Polished surfaces and carefully articulated masonry joints were tributes to good craftsmanship, but these were hardly as Picturesque as a rubbly ruin, stained by weather, encrusted with moss and sprouting wildflow-<lb/>
ers.</p>
<p>According to <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>, nature was an admirable colorist but deficient in terms of Picturesque compo-<lb/>
sition, and the estate improver's art therefore, like the painter's, was to take little liberties, particularly with regard to the foreground, adding here and there a few trees and in other ways giving an air of wildness to the place. "Turn the lawn into a piece of broken ground: plant rugged oaks instead of flowering shrubs: break the edges of the walk: give it the rudeness of a road: mark it with wheel tracks; and scatter around a few stones, and brash-wood; and in a word, instead of making the whole <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi>, make it <hi rend="italic">rough;</hi> and you also make it <hi rend="italic">picturesque</hi>."<ref target="#CH7-n28"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">28</hi></hi></ref> Similarly, grazing sheep with their rough woolly coats of "just that dingy hue, which contrasts with the verdure of the ground"<ref target="#CH7-n29"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">29</hi></hi></ref> were highly desirable in a park.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Gilpin</name>'s fellow enthusiasts for the Picturesque, <name type="pname">Richard Payne Knight</name> (<date when="1750">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824">1824</date>) and <name type="pname">Uvedale Price</name> (<date when="1747">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>), on the other hand, were less charitable in their attitude toward <name type="pname">Brown</name>. Their views were doctrinaire and uncompromising, and to their eyes, <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s work was insipid. In <hi rend="italic">The Landscape, A Didactic Poem</hi> of <date when="1794">1794</date>, <name type="pname">Knight</name> uses Pope's heroic couplets in a diatribe against the "fav'rite <name type="pname">Brown</name> whose innovating hand / First dealt thy curses o'er this fertile land." <name type="pname">Knight</name> held an almost sentimental affection for the few remaining seventeenth-century gardens of Wise and <name type="place">London</name> with their "kings of yew, and goddesses of lead," for by his time these had the virtue of having grown picturesquely decrepit with age. An old-fashioned garden of this kind, in addition, encompassed merely the immediate environs of the house where "Inclos'd by walls, and terraces, and mounds / Its mischiefs were confin'd to narrow bounds." In the same way that the eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century painter or sketch artist avoided a linear style and crisp outline in favor of chiaroscuro effects of light and shade, so according to proponents of the Pic-<lb/>
turesque, the landscape improver should avoid neat definitions of forms in favor of hazier, less distinct shapes that produced a more "artistic" appearance. <name type="pname">Knight</name>'s friend <name type="pname">Uvedale Price</name> also deplored the sacri-<lb/>
fice of the old hunting parks to the improver's hand,
<pb n="254"/>
<pb n="254" type="orig"/>
and his work <hi rend="italic">On the Picturesque</hi> (<date when="1784">1784</date>), which enjoyed several editions and was extensively read for the better part of a century, inquires "whether the present system of improving &#x2026; is founded on any just principles of taste."<ref target="#CH7-n30"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">30</hi></hi></ref> Like <name type="pname">Knight</name>, he believed that a knowledge of the works of the great masters, particularly those of <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name>, <name type="pname">Poussin</name>, <name type="pname">Salva-<lb/>
tor Rosa</name>, and the Dutch school, and an understanding of the <hi rend="italic">principles</hi> of painting&#x2014;"general composi-<lb/>
tion&#x2014;grouping the separate parts&#x2014;harmony of tints&#x2014;unity of character"<ref target="#CH7-n31"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">31</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;should inform the minds of those who would be improvers.</p>
<p>According to <name type="pname">Price</name>, in studying painting one readily observes that two interrelated qualities con-<lb/>
stitute the essence of the Picturesque: <hi rend="italic">intricacy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">variety</hi>. He defines intricacy as "that disposition of objects, which, by a partial and uncertain conceal-<lb/>
ment, excites and nourishes curiosity," while variety in scenery is defined as that which is in opposition to the formulaic perfection of <name type="pname">Brown</name>. Monotony is the enemy of the Picturesque, and <name type="pname">Price</name> deplores that once the "mechanical and commonplace operation, by which <name type="pname">Mr. Brown</name> and his followers have gained so much credit," is begun, one is forced to bid "adieu to all that the painter admires&#x2014;to all intricacies&#x2014;to all the beautiful varieties of form, tint, and light and shade; every deep recess&#x2014;every bold projection&#x2014;the fantastic roots of trees&#x2014;the winding paths of sheep" together with "what time only, and a thou-<lb/>
sand lucky accidents can mature, so as to make [the landscape] become the admiration and study of a Ruysdael or a Gainsborough."<ref target="#CH7-n32"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">32</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Though both were united in their intense oppo-<lb/>
sition to <name type="pname">Brown</name>, there are distinctions between <name type="pname">Knight</name>'s version of Picturesque theory and that of <name type="pname">Price</name>. For <name type="pname">Knight</name>, picturesqueness resides within the eye of the beholder who, by "having his mind enriched with the embellishments of the painter and the poet," invests natural objects with "ideal and imaginary beauties; that is, beauties, which are not felt by the organic sense of vision; but by the intellect and imagination through that sense."<ref target="#CH7-n33"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">33</hi></hi></ref> <name type="pname">Price</name>, on the other hand, tries to objectify the Picturesque, making it a separate category alongside <name type="pname">Burke</name>'s categories of the beautiful and the sublime.</p>
<p>While critical of the serpentine outlines of <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s bodies of water, <name type="pname">Price</name> reserves his greatest scorn for the improver's method of planting trees in clumps. <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s clumps appear to him variously as regimental soldiers on parade or as so many pud-<lb/>
dings turned out of a mold. He finds even the old arrow-straight approach avenues of an earlier gener-<lb/>
ation preferable to the narrow winding belts of newly planted trees beside <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s drives. In this vein of contrariety, he romantically admires such entrance roads as those leading to Stowe and <name type="pname">Castle Howard</name> for their solemnity and grandeur, especially at night when a few gleams of moonlight pierce the deep gloom of their dense foliage.</p>
<p>Practical minds took with a grain of salt <name type="pname">Price</name>'s prescription of negligence as a means toward art. Even his admiring mid-nineteenth-century editor inserted into <name type="pname">Price</name>'s reprinted text a note of warning regarding the advantages of smooth, well-graded carriage roads over picturesquely rough ones. While the Picturesque theorists greatly stimulated a new appetite for travel into the wilder parts of the British Isles, estate improvement, with some increased pic-<lb/>
turesqueness in the park, continued to develop in a manner derived from <name type="pname">Kent</name> and <name type="pname">Brown</name>. That an inter-<lb/>
mediate position between two perceived polarities prevailed as the English countryside continued to be coaxed into new patterns of domestic felicity was due in large measure to the practice and writings of <name type="pname">Humphry Repton</name>.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">

<p><name type="pname">Humphry Repton</name> (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818">1818</date>), <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s self-ap-<lb/>
pointed successor and the inheritor of his practice, felt obliged to seize the gauntlet thrown down by <name type="pname">Knight</name> and <name type="pname">Price</name>. He therefore took up his pen to defend the great <name type="pname">Brown</name>, attempting to show how the principles of painting and landscaping were not, in fact, one and the same as the Picturesque theorists maintained. According to <name type="pname">Repton</name>, the landscape sub-<lb/>
ject matter suitable for painting was that which could be contained within the representational confines of the artist's canvas, whereas the beauties of real land-<lb/>
scape encompassed those of prospect&#x2014;panoramic views obtained from a lofty ridge or belvedere. He maintained that "the good sense and good taste of this country will never be led to despise the comfort of a gravel walk, the delicious fragrance of a shrub-<lb/>
bery, the soul-expanding delight of a wide extended prospect, or a view down a steep hill, because they are all subjects incapable of being painted."<ref target="#CH7-n34"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">34</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><name type="pname">Repton</name>, as a professional landscape gardener, had thought it important to discourage amateur improvers who were, in his opinion, in the same position as a patient "quacking himself." Unlike <name type="pname">Brown</name>, whose schooling was essentially vocational, <name type="pname">Repton</name> had, in fact, received a gentleman's educa-<lb/>
tion and had been led to his professional practice by his own enthusiasm as an amateur improver and the realization that, with <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s death, a vacuum had been created, which a man with small means and a growing family could hope to fill.</p>
<p>Like his American successor, <name type="pname">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, another amateur-turned-landscape-profes-<lb/>
sional, <name type="pname">Repton</name> found his way to his vocational call-<lb/>
<pb n="255"/>
<pb n="255" type="orig"/>
ing by a circuitous route; both were financially unsuccessful in business and as gentleman farmers. <name type="pname">Repton</name> decided to adopt a new vocation in <date when="1788">1788</date>. Hav-<lb/>
ing moved into a cottage on Hare Street in the Essex village of Romford in order to accommodate his reduced financial circumstances, <name type="pname">Repton</name>, after a rest-<lb/>
less night pondering his future, arose, christened him-<lb/>
self a "landscape gardener," and had cards printed, which, with the help of his friends, soon brought this new professional nomenclature into currency in the best drawing rooms of <name type="place">England</name>. In order to fulfill his intention of becoming the successor to <name type="pname">Brown</name>, who had died five years earlier, he set out to see many recently improved estates, including such famous ones as <name type="pname">Blenheim</name> Stowe and, following the new fash-<lb/>
ion for Picturesque travel initiated by <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>, he made a sketching tour in <date when="1789">1789</date> of the Essex forests.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Repton</name>'s almost immediate success was due to an idea he hit upon at the outset. A talented watercol-<lb/>
orist, he would do more than assure his clients of their properties' capabilities; he would demonstrate with his facile pen and brush a series of "before and after" effects. In his Red Books, so named for their red morocco leather bindings, he made watercolor render-<lb/>
ings with fold-over flaps. The scene depicted when the flaps were closed was one of rural scenery awaiting landscape improvement. When opened, the part of the image that had been formerly concealed was seen to portray the same landscape as it would appear when transformed by <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s planned improvements. This "existing-and-proposed" format constituted an irre-<lb/>
sistible ploy, and <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s clients were happy to pay his charge for producing a Red Book in addition to his usual fee for his survey work and recommendations on property improvement (figs. 7.24a, 7.24b). The volumes became proud tokens of their possessing that characteristic most prized by eighteenth-century polite society: good taste. They served, of course, in addi-<lb/>
tion, as discreet advertisements of <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s work, helping to attract future clients.</p>
<p>In <name type="pname">Repton</name>, <name type="pname">Brown</name>, who had left no written record of his principles of design, found a proponent in much the same way as <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> gained influence through the influential treatise of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>. But, although <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s professed heir and the grateful recipient, from <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s son, of maps of the estates where his father had worked, <name type="pname">Repton</name> had imbibed the Picturesque sensibility of his time. In subtle ways, he distanced himself increasingly over the years from the system devised by the famous improver. Indeed, he advocated no system at all, but rather <hi rend="italic">good taste</hi> based on certain principles first developed in the Red Books and later articulated in printed books after he realized that he could broaden the audience for his ideas, increase the reputation of his work, and supplement his income through publication. <hi rend="italic">Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening</hi> (<date when="1795">1795</date>) was followed by other works, including <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</hi> (<date when="1803">1803</date>), and a final collection of thoughts gathered from a busy lifetime, <hi rend="italic">Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</hi> (<date when="1816">1816</date>).</p>
<p>Like <name type="pname">Kent</name>, <name type="pname">Repton</name> conceived his landscape ideas pictorially. Perspectives, rather than plans, were his chief means of expression (although, unlike <name type="pname">Kent</name>, he did produce plans for his clients). As painting was his stock-in-trade and he was responsible for more than three thousand sketches and the multiplication of some of these many times over through published engravings, he was particularly stung when <name type="pname">Richard Payne Knight</name> in his essay <hi rend="italic">An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste</hi> (<date when="1805">1805</date>) took exception to the term <hi rend="italic">landscape gardening</hi> and attacked <name type="pname">Repton</name> per-<lb/>
sonally by suggesting that "he who gave it the title may explain [why a practice that had produced] not one complete painter's composition [in many of the] beautiful and picturesque spots" of <name type="place">England</name> should be so called.<ref target="#CH7-n35"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">35</hi></hi></ref></p>

At the same time, he tactfully described concessions that he deemed appropriate for the sake of convenience and comfort, such as the reunification of the kitchen garden with the house or the design of the drive leading to the house not as a circuitous excursion but as a more direct route, though these things were in contradiction to <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s practice.

<p>The conservatism and respect for tradition that induced <name type="pname">Repton</name> to align himself with <name type="pname">Brown</name> in the first place, together with the fight he was forced to wage against the Picturesque critics throughout his career, do not obscure his steady advance toward an eclectic style that may be called the <hi rend="italic">ornamental Pic-<lb/>
turesque</hi>. In <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s plans, the balustraded terrace that <name type="pname">Brown</name> had banned found its way back to the house where it served as a zone of transition between architecture and landscape. Participating in the explo-<lb/>
sion of interest in botany occurring in his day, he incorporated exotic shrubs and trees in his plans and even allowed the flower garden, which had been cat-<lb/>
egorically banished by <name type="pname">Brown</name> and despised by the advocates of the wild Picturesque, to exist once more in the vicinity of the house (fig. 7.25). He grasped the benefits to horticulture as well as the decorative pos-<lb/>
sibilities inherent in industrial technology and found many uses for a new material, cast iron, both as orna-<lb/>
ment and as <hi rend="italic">treillage</hi>. His pergolas and trellis arches, of both cast iron and wood, diminished the classicism of the landscape and soon became mainstays of the Victorian garden. The cast-iron-and-glass conservato-<lb/>
ries for tender plants he introduced as gardenlike extensions of the house had a similar result.</p>
<p>Although horrified at the excesses committed in <name type="place">France</name> in the name of equality, <name type="pname">Repton</name> had a sharper social conscience than had <name type="pname">Brown</name>. Villages were no longer swept away because they marred a view; now their inherent picturesqueness served to complement the landscapes of great houses (fig. 7.26). Such ordi-<lb/>
nary landscapes are the domain of cultural geogra-<lb/>
phers today and were, as we shall read in Chapter Eleven, also appreciated by the Edwardian garden designer <name type="pname">Gertrude Jekyll</name> (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1932">1932</date>), who lovingly photographed the cottages, gardens, and farmsteads of rural Surrey at the time when these components of the rural English scene were rapidly disappearing. If we were to chart the general attitude toward the vernacu-<lb/>
lar environment among people of social influence, we might say that <name type="pname">Repton</name> points the way toward a more democratic and all-encompassing view of landscape and of the place-making achievements of common folk. In any case, by the end of his career, the era of great estate landscaping was effectively over, and the
<pb n="257"/>
<pb n="257" type="orig"/>
challenge that those who came after <name type="pname">Repton</name> addressed was one of inculcating the principles of taste within the ranks of a prosperous and expanding middle class.</p>

<p>Unlike <name type="pname">Brown</name>, who practiced architecture himself, <name type="pname">Humphrey Repton</name> associated with professional architects in the execution of his commissions. His eldest son, <name type="pname">John Adey Repton</name> (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">1860</date>), became an enthusiastic antiquarian and architect, apprentic-<lb/>
ing first in his father's office and later working in that of <name type="pname">John Nash</name> (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">1835</date>). <name type="pname">Humphrey Repton</name> and <name type="pname">John Nash</name> enjoyed a profitable professional association for a few years beginning in <date when="1796">1796</date>. Both <name type="pname">John Repton</name> and his brother, <name type="pname">George Stanley Repton</name> (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>), worked in Nash's office, and the sty-<lb/>
listic union between the Reptonian Picturesque land-<lb/>
scape and Nash's Regency Neoclassicism provided the model for a <hi rend="italic">rus in urbe</hi>, or country-in-the-city, ideal of urban planning in which landscape was employed to soften and relieve the oppressive hard-<lb/>
ness of pavements and buildings.</p>
<p>Bath, the Regency spa built on the site of a hot spring and ancient Roman resort by the architects <name type="pname">John Wood the Elder</name> (<date when="1704">1704</date>&#x2013;<date when="1754">1754</date>) and his son, <name type="pname">John Wood</name> the younger (<date when="1728">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781">1781</date>), is important as an early example of this <hi rend="italic">rus in urbe</hi> approach to plan-<lb/>
ning. Here, promenades were created as bands of greenery, and housing blocks were built around landscaped squares and on terraces with broad views of open countryside (fig. 7.27). These urban design amenities made Bath a new kind of city, one that married genteel architecture with natural scenery. Immediately popular, the town became in the eigh-<lb/>
teenth century a favorite locale for members of the aristocracy and gentry seeking to improve their health. It was moreover a place of amusement and social diversion. The atmosphere of friendliness and mild license, restrained by rules of social etiquette, provided opportunities for encounters among mem-<lb/>
bers of the opposite sex, creating the town's reputa-<lb/>
tion of being a marriage market.</p>
<p>First, Wood the Elder laid out Queen Square (<date when="1729">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1736">36</date>) in the trim Regency architectural style. He next developed the Grand Parade (<date when="1740">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743">43</date>), with green vistas beyond the river Avon. Another residential grouping, the Circus (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758">58</date>) followed, in which a unified ring of houses was built around a central open space. Wood the Younger built the Royal Crescent (<date when="1767">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1775">75</date>), and <name type="pname">John Palmer</name> estab-<lb/>
lished the Lansdown Crescent (<date when="1794">1794</date>) on the slope above it (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794">94</date>). With its rolling greensward upon which sheep grazed and lovely views of the surrounding Avon Valley countryside, the Royal Crescent soon superseded the Grand Parade as the city's most popular promenade. The public's enthu-<lb/>
siasm for this kind of plan&#x2014;in origin, an example of enlightened real-estate development&#x2014;led to a comparable effort in <name type="place">London</name> around Regent's Park.</p>

<p>Regent's Park's beginnings are much the same as those of Hyde Park, as both were manor proper-<lb/>
ties assigned to monastic orders and then appropri-<lb/>
ated as hunting parks by <name type="pname">Henry VIII</name> upon the dissolution of the monasteries in <date when="1536">1536</date>. The Maryle-<lb/>

ers cut down its venerable forest for lumber in order to realize a profit on their investment. As <name type="place">London</name>'s growth pushed northward throughout the eighteenth century, it became apparent to <name type="pname">John Fordyce</name>, the Surveyor General of Crown Lands, that, when the lease on the property held by the duke of Portland expired in <date when="1811">1811</date>, the park (then occupied by the cot-<lb/>
tages of agricultural laborers and gentlemen seeking
<pb n="258"/>
<pb n="258" type="orig"/>
a rural retreat) would become prime real estate from which the royal family could realize an enormous financial gain if the land was developed judiciously.</p>

<p>Instead of recommending that it be divided like the neighboring Portland estate into a checkerboard of housing blocks built around a square, Fordyce held a design competition from which emerged Nash's con-<lb/>
cept of a ring of independent villas within the park and a crescent of town houses at its southern end (fig. 7.28). The plan for Marylebone, which was at that time renamed Regent's Park for Nash's patron, the <name type="pname">Prince Regent</name> (later <name type="pname">George IV</name>), following that of Bath, weds Regency Neoclassical architecture to Reptonian prin-<lb/>
ciples of landscape design. After some financial and practical difficulties were overcome, a crescent of stuc-<lb/>
coed houses with uniform facades was built along the outer perimeter of the southern part of the park. Only eight of Nash's originally planned fifty-six indepen-<lb/>
dent villas were built, nor was the interior ring of row houses realized, and the park gradually began to accommodate other uses.<ref target="#CH7-n36"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">36</hi></hi></ref> In spite of the lack of demand for its proposed villas, Regent's Park provided an influential example for future suburban-style devel-<lb/>
opment in <name type="place">London</name> and elsewhere, and many later spec-<lb/>
ulations in real estate bore the word "Park" as part of their name.</p>
<p>While most squares in <name type="place">London</name>, unlike those in <name type="place">Paris</name>, had been conceived as patches of greenery, they could hardly be called Picturesque. But such was the popularity of this style that, by the early nineteenth century, sheep were allowed to strike a pastoral note in Cavendish Square, and Grosvenor and Portman Squares were given more naturalistic treatment. <name type="pname">Rep-<lb/>
ton</name> himself was commissioned to redesign Cadogan and Russell Squares in a Picturesque manner. With these and other similar developments, burgeoning <name type="place">Lon-<lb/>

<p>In <date when="1804">1804</date>, <name type="pname">Repton</name> was called by <name type="pname">Sir Charles Cock-<lb/>

After his visit to Sezincote, as <name type="pname">Cockerell</name> had christened his estate, <name type="pname">Rep-<lb/>

pare plans for a new Brighton Pavilion, the <name type="pname">Prince Regent</name>'s summer home, he introduced his design pro-<lb/>
<pb n="259"/>
<pb n="259" type="orig"/>
posal with an elaborate explanation of the suitability of such Sezincote-style Hindu architecture for the project. Ten years passed before the <name type="pname">Prince Regent</name> could assemble the funds to build the Pavilion, at which time he commissioned Nash to follow the exotic "Hinduism" of <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s original inspiration.</p>

The 1,350-acre park he created, however, had no underlying iconographic program as did <name type="pname">Hoare</name>'s Stourhead but was built according to a vision in which the eye's movement through landscape space was reckoned according to Picturesque princi-<lb/>
ples guided by existing natural conditions. He was able to conceive landscape as a continuum of broad and varied spatial effects, and his work transforming a large stretch of the Neisse River Valley, including its industrial, agricultural, and urban scenery as well as the immediate grounds around his castle, into a uni-<lb/>

<p>A regimental officer with a well-developed taste for travel, <name type="pname">Prince P&#x00FC;ckler</name> turned down an ambassa-<lb/>
dorship in order to manage his ancestral estates in old Silesia, approximately 100 miles (161 kilometers) southeast of <name type="place">Berlin</name> straddling what is now the Ger-<lb/>
man-Polish border. Encouraged by <name type="pname">Goethe</name>, whom he met in Weimer in <date when="1812">1812</date>, he believed that exemplary land improvement could contribute to the welfare of Prussia as much as diplomatic and political service. Energetic, athletic, and a lover of nature, he began transforming his estate of <name type="pname">Muskau</name> into an idealized version of nature in <date when="1816">1816</date>, with an abiding passion that ultimately brought him financial ruin. In <date when="1828">1828</date>, he made an extended trip to <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">Ireland</name>, osten-<lb/>
sibly to improve his fortunes but in fact to steep him-<lb/>
self in the scenery of the country he considered most conducive to "a gentlemanly (<hi rend="italic">gentlemanartigen</hi>) enjoyment of life" in which comfort was combined with "the fullest appreciation of a noble sense of beauty" and "landscape gardening has also developed to an extent that no period and no other country seem to have known."<ref target="#CH7-n38"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">38</hi></hi></ref> Although he invited Humphrey <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s son <name type="pname">John</name> to <name type="pname">Muskau</name> to advise him, he was too assured and avid a connoisseur of landscape not to remain personally in charge of designing <name type="pname">Muskau</name>'s park according to a unified scheme "thoroughly thought out from the first, and guided all the way through by one controlling mind, a mind that should make use of the thoughts of many others, welding them into an organic whole so that the stamp of indi-<lb/>

<p>To build his park, it was necessary to purchase some 2,000 acres of property, including the houses of townsmen and villagers and to demolish in the coun-<lb/>
try town of <name type="pname">Muskau</name> an entire street adjacent to his castle, the site of the large lake made by damming the river Neisse. Still, <name type="pname">P&#x00FC;ckler-Muskau</name> expressed a sense of duty and responsibility toward his vassals, the inhabitants over whom he exercised sovereign rights until that prerogative was assigned to the state alone as the European political climate was liberalized in the wake of the French Revolution. He left the gates of his park open, and it was used regularly by the townspeople as a local pleasure ground.</p>

<p>The remaining town lying against the side of a mountain formed a collection of architecturally Pic-<lb/>

est of opening views and "making so many others visible which had previously been quite obscured."<ref target="#CH7-n40"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">40</hi></hi></ref> He further recommended "that graceful negligence, so difficult to emulate, in which Nature remains ever the mistress, by the plantation of single shrubs and trees scattered freely over the grass."<ref target="#CH7-n41"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">41</hi></hi></ref> The result of this design approach, evident in the distant views across the tree-fringed meadows of the park at <name type="pname">Mus-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Humphry Repton</name> lived in an age of political revolu-<lb/>
tion, which saw the birth of republican government in <name type="place">France</name> and the establishment of <name type="place">Britain</name>'s American colonies as an independent republic. In addition, the effects of the Industrial Revolution were beginning to transform both urban and rural life. These cultural currents profoundly altered the enterprise of land-<lb/>
scape design, making it only marginally the preroga-<lb/>
tive of princes and the pastime of the landed gently. The values of a prosperous aristocracy would soon be superseded by the commercialism of a new manufac-<lb/>
turing class.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Repton</name>, who had a normally cheerful disposi-<lb/>
tion, was disturbed by the social dislocations of the Napoleonic wars and the consequent heartless life of mercenary opportunists; Becky Sharp, the protagonist of <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi> (<date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">48</date>) by <name type="pname">William Makepeace Thackeray</name>, is a fictional portrayal of such a type. The superficial life of fashionable Bath was as alien to <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s temperament as it was to <name type="pname">Jane Austen</name>'s. Like <name type="pname">William Wordsworth</name> and <name type="pname">Jean-Jacques Rous-<lb/>
seau</name>, <name type="pname">Repton</name> recognized that sensibility was the com-<lb/>
mon property of the human soul rather than merely the province of an educated upper class. He was able to embrace the view of nature as a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> good and of landscape design as a <hi rend="italic">social</hi> responsibility. His was a liberal-minded paternalism that was still tied to the old agrarian society, now in transition. <name type="pname">Dorothea Brooke</name> in <hi rend="italic">Middlemarch</hi> (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872">72</date>) by <name type="pname">George Eliot</name>, with her plans for improving tenant cottages, would have been a heroine after his heart. Although lament-<lb/>
ing that gentlemen farmers no longer took care of the parish poor, for his son Edward, the vicar at Crayford in <name type="pname">Kent</name>, <name type="pname">Repton</name> prepared plans for a workhouse for paupers, which he saw as a humane model of that type of institution (fig. 7.31). Perhaps his greatest gift to posterity was the good sense he conferred upon the Picturesque style, modifying it and making it a prac-<lb/>
ticable idiom for the design of the public park, the landscape institution <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of the coming democratic age. Yet even as the forces of revolution-<lb/>
ary republicanism were gathering momentum, <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> aristocrats in <name type="place">France</name> put their own particular stamp on the Picturesque style, which was quite dif-<lb/>

<p>The French never attempted to substitute the curvilin-<lb/>
ear landscape abstractions of Capability <name type="pname">Brown</name> for their own geometric ones. Their notion of the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> was that of an earlier period associated with the emblematic temples and monuments of the Augus-<lb/>
tan amateurs and the creators of th <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi>&#x2014;<name type="pname">Ste-<lb/>
phen Switzer</name>, writer and garden designer; <name type="pname">William Shenstone</name>, the proprietor of The Leasowes; and <name type="pname">Philip Southcote</name>, the owner of Woburn Farm. Although they are called <hi rend="italic">jardins anglais</hi>, the Picturesque gardens of <name type="place">France</name> are independent phenomena, influenced by, yet philosophically and stylistically separate from, con-<lb/>
temporary English gardens.<ref target="#CH7-n42"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">42</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>While Turkish tents and Chinese bridges are also found in eighteenth-century English gardens, these picturesquely Rococo features are more prevalent in French ones. French eighteenth-century gardens were consciously conceived as stage sets by designers who often also worked in the theater. This aspect of French gardens of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> is perhaps also explained by the fact that they spring out of the dramatic tradi-<lb/>
tion of French pastoral romance, which is filled with bucolic sentiment, rather than from a literary tradition of poetry imbued with moral philosophy, as was the case with the English eighteenth-century garden.</p>
<p>The structures that ornamented these gardens, called <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi>, were like theatrical scenery, usually rustic in style. The enthusiasm for <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> was such that in the eighteenth-century French gardens that go by the name <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi> they became the whole point, more than was the case in <name type="place">England</name> where the balance between ornamental structures and land-<lb/>
scape still favored landscape. Some of these gardens were as hill of theatrical set pieces as <name type="place">Disneyland</name>.</p>
<p>While this type of garden was built for the amusement of aristocrats in the years immediately pre-<lb/>
ceding the French Revolution, there were other gar-<lb/>
dens, also of a Picturesque character, in which <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> did not overwhelm nature, where solitary contemplation and quiet friendship were the goal. These were directly influenced by <name type="pname">Jean-Jacques Rous-<lb/>
seau</name> (<date when="1712">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">1778</date>), a principal progenitor of the Romantic movement, whose writings awakened fac-<lb/>
ulties of perception and an intuitive mode of thought in which sentiment, more than reason, was the govern-<lb/>
ing principle. The French Picturesque garden can thus be characterized as falling into two basic types: those of a theatrical, exotic, and libertine <hi rend="italic">anglo-chinois</hi> char-<lb/>
acter on the one hand, and those of a moral and senti-<lb/>
mental Rousseauesque character on the other. The former is epitomized by the Parc Monceau, <name type="pname">Car-<lb/>
montelle</name>'s bizarre fantasy creation for the duc de Char-<lb/>
tres, a tame remnant of which survives today as a pleasant green oasis in the sixteenth <hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> of <name type="place">Paris</name>. Examples of the latter are <name type="pname">Moulin Jolie</name>, the gar-<lb/>
den designed by the artist <name type="pname">Claude-Henri Watelet</name>, and <name type="pname">Ermenonville</name>, the estate of the <name type="pname">marquis de Girardin</name>.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Anglo-Chinois Style</hi></hi></head>
<p>The publication in <date when="1743">1743</date> of a description of Chinese gardens by the French Jesuit missionary-artist <name type="pname">Jean-Denis Attiret</name> (<date when="1707">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768">1768</date>) helped bring into vogue a taste for irregular garden layouts and Rococo <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>. Subsequently, <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois-de-Paule Latapie</name> (<date when="1739">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823">1823</date>), the translator into French of <name type="pname">Whately</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</hi>, declared that the English garden, with its lack of geometric formality, was derived from the Chinese. Between <date when="1776">1776</date> and <date when="1787">1787</date>, <name type="pname">George-Louis Le Rouge</name> published twenty-one books of engravings titled <hi rend="italic">D&#x00E9;tails des nouveaux jar-<lb/>
dins &#x00E0; la mode: jardins anglo-chinois</hi>, which also pro-<lb/>
moted acceptance of the term <hi rend="italic">anglo-chinois</hi> and the notion that the English garden was influenced by the Chinese. This apparent attempt to deprive the English of the distinction of having originated their own gar-<lb/>
den style, and the resentment of this on the part of the English, illustrates the historic rivalry between the two countries. But it was nonetheless true that an Englishman, <name type="pname">William Chambers</name>, was the principal advocate for designing in the Chinese manner. His <hi rend="italic">Design of Chinese Buildings</hi> was published in both French and English in <date when="1757">1757</date>. Le Rouge devotes an entire book, <hi rend="italic">Cahier V</hi>, to reproducing this treatise by <name type="pname">Chambers</name>. With its illustrations in the hands of Con-<lb/>
tinental garden designers, pagodas and other similarly exotic <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> became even more popular in <name type="place">France</name> and <name type="place">Germany</name> than in <name type="pname">Chambers</name>'s native <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
<p>Innocent of the underlying design principles of the Chinese garden, <name type="pname">Chambers</name> saw Chinese structures "as toys in architecture," colorful bits of exotica to borrow for their superficial charm. These were but the decorative spice for his recipe of sensational effects. The production of sensations&#x2014;particularly those of thrilling fear, amazed delight, and awed surprise&#x2014;was the purpose of a <name type="pname">Chambers</name> garden. On these terms, a gardener should be a master of artifice and stagecraft, the provider of theatrical marvels. Helped by the technology of the age, landscape designers of the <name type="pname">Chambers</name> school could produce mock thunder and lightning and experiment with the newly released power of electricity.</p>

Along with <name type="pname">Chambers</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Design of Chinese Buildings</hi>, <name type="pname">Fischer von Erlach</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Entwurff einer historischen Architectur</hi> (<date when="1721">1721</date>) furnished illustrations of Chinese, Egyptian, and other exotic architectural styles, and in designing Monceau, <name type="pname">Carmontelle</name> was probably inspired by engravings in both of these works.<ref target="#CH7-n43"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">43</hi></hi></ref> In his prospectus for the garden, <name type="pname">Carmontelle</name>, who also served as a playwright, set designer, and master of ceremonies for the duke, stated that he wished to create a garden "based on fantasy, &#x2026; the extraordinary, and the amus-<lb/>
ing, and not on the desire to imitate Nature." An ancestor of the modern theme park, Parc Monceau was built as an elaborate entertainment facility, a mag-<lb/>
ical place evoking other lands and other periods in history (figs. 7.32a, 7.32b, 7.33).</p>
<p>An enclosed Winter Garden introduced the visi-<lb/>
tor to the marvels of the park. It had <hi rend="italic">trompe l'oeil</hi> trees for walls, crystal lanterns, an illuminated waterfall, a grotto, and an overhead room from which musicians entertained those dining below. Passing outdoors, one wandered through a charming rustic farm, past a cab-<lb/>
aret and an ornamental dairy, to the romantically Pic-<lb/>
turesque Ruins of the Temple of Mars. Beyond these stretched the Island of Rocks set in a winding stream overlooked by a Dutch Mill. There was a Flower Marsh and a garden mount, its base on one side con-<lb/>
structed as a cave giving entry to the ice house, and its top crowned by a belvedere (alternatively described as a Turkish "minaret" and a Gothic pavilion). Past the Flower Marsh, one came to the Wood of Tombs, which contained, in addition to its romantically sug-<lb/>
gestive mock tombs, a pyramid, an urn, and a foun-<lb/>
tain.</p>
<p>Classical motifs predominated in the next sec-<lb/>
tions of the garden with, first, an Italian Vineyard pre-<lb/>
sided over by <name type="pname">Bacchus</name> and, beyond that, the <hi rend="italic">Bois irr&#x00E9;gulier</hi> with more ruined monuments, a statue of Mercury, a bell tower, and Houdon's Fountain of the Bathers. A ruined gate led from here to the Nauma-<lb/>
chia, built in imitation of those ancient and Renais-<lb/>
sance ponds in which mock naval battles were fought. This oval pool featured an obelisk situated on an island of rock and a ruined Corinthian peristyle at one end (fig. 7.33; see fig. 7.32b).</p>
<p>Still the catalogue of tourist sights continued. The rest of the visitor's itinerary included the Military Column, a small botanical garden, the Fountain of the Nymph, a sculpture of <name type="place">Paris</name>, a Turkish tent, a circular temple of marble, a Chinese bridge, the <hi rend="italic">Bois r&#x00E9;gulier</hi>, a ruined castle that served as another belvedere, a water mill, a rustic cascade spanned by a stone bridge, and an island of sheep, which was next to the pretty little farm where one's itinerary through <name type="pname">Car-<lb/>
montelle</name>'s sequence of scenes came full circle. But here there was still more for the busy eye to behold: a <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden in front of the main pavilion, beside which stood a maypole-carousel, called a <hi rend="italic">jeu de bague</hi>, and two more Turkish tents.</p>
<p>These were the fantastic pleasures of Parc Mon-<lb/>
ceau, a place where the display of objects, rather than
<pb n="263"/>
<pb n="263" type="orig"/>
the plastic modeling of garden space, constituted the landscape designer's principal objective. In its m&#x00E9;lange of exotic styles it provided a more catholic and interna-<lb/>

ton</name>, which were, above all, celebrations of the Englishness of <name type="place">England</name>. Here one sought the genie of the Arabian Nights rather than the genius of the place. Perhaps the principal legacy of this and other so-called <hi rend="italic">anglo-chinois</hi> gardens was as a catalogue of ornamental features for the eclectic designers of parks and gardens throughout the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Rousseau</name>, in working out his democratic theories, had idealized his native Geneva as a paradigm of good government and social justice. Here citizens lived in close harmony with nature, for their autonomous dwell-<lb/>

<p>Imagination&#x2014;the faculty for creating images based upon intuitive perception&#x2014;was an essential ingredient in <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s idealism. His vision of Geneva as a Golden Age community was one such imaginary ideal, composed of images of natural man, refreshed and inspired by frequent contact with the outdoors and uncorrupted by the passions of an artifi-<lb/>

nity within the amiable bosom of his family, patriotically participating in the civic weal. <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s immensely popular novel <hi rend="italic">Julie, ou la Nouvelle H&#x00E9;lo&#x00EF;se</hi> (<date when="1761">1761</date>), thematically prefigured, and probably helped inspire, <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>'s antiurban vision of the vir-<lb/>

<p>In <date when="1763">1763</date>, following service as an officer in the Seven Years' War, <name type="pname">Louis-Ren&#x00E9;</name>, <name type="pname">vicomte d'Ermenonville</name>, <name type="pname">marquis de Girardin</name> (<date when="1735">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808">1808</date>), visited <name type="place">England</name>, where he was impressed by the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> as a model of estate design and management. The garden as a privileged space for enlightened reverie, nature as imagination's muse, rustic simplicity as a means to virtue&#x2014;these Rousseauesque principles also inspired the marquis when he built Ermenonville, beginning in the early <date when="1770">1770</date>s. French Romanticism and the example of the English <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> underlie his treatise <hi rend="italic">De la Composition des paysages, ou, des moyens d'embellir la nature autour des habitations, en y joignant l'agr&#x00E9;able &#x00E0; l'utile</hi> (<date when="1777">1777</date>), the only such French trea-<lb/>
tise to receive a contemporary translation into English.</p>
<p>Just as the images of <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name> had influ-<lb/>
enced the development of the English garden, so did this artist and such seventeenth-century Dutch land-<lb/>
scape painters as <name type="pname">Jacob van Ruisdael</name> (<date when="1628">1628</date>/<date when="1629">9</date>&#x2013;<date when="1682">1682</date>) and <name type="pname">Meindert Hobbema</name> (<date when="1638">1638</date>&#x2013;<date when="1709">1709</date>) figure in the evolution of the French garden in the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. In addition, three contemporary French painters, well known to the marquis, offered assistance both by the images they depicted on canvas and through their personal involvement in garden design. They were <name type="pname">Claude-Henri Watelet</name> (<date when="1718">1718</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786">1786</date>), <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois Boucher</name> (<date when="1703">1703</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770">1770</date>), and <name type="pname">Hubert Robert</name>.</p>
<p>Watelet, like the marquis, was acquainted with <name type="pname">Rousseau</name> and was, like the nobleman, the author of a treatise on garden design.<ref target="#CH7-n46"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">46</hi></hi></ref> His own garden, Moulin Joli, built on an island, incorporated various <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> into its essentially geometrical plan, in addition to the picturesque old mill from which it derived its name. In basic sympathy with the prevailing social system of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> and lacking a principled opposition to geometric planning&#x2014;unlike the <name type="pname">Whig</name> landowners in <name type="place">England</name> who saw in regularity an implied challenge to their libertarian values&#x2014;designers like Watelet were more disposed to harmonize geometric regularity and rusticity. His scenes of venerably decrepit rustic picturesqueness were therefore conceived as sophisti-<lb/>
cated Rococo perspectives within the garden's web of straight <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi>. Watelet's house, a simple bourgeois dwelling remodeled by his friend Boucher in the <hi rend="italic">style champ&#x00EA;tre</hi>, stood opposite the mill.</p>
<p>Initially, Girardin worked to develop Erme-non-<lb/>
ville with <name type="pname">Jean-Marie Morel</name> (<date when="1728">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810">1810</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Th&#x00E9;orie des jardins</hi> (<date when="1776">1776</date>), who was later employed
<pb n="265"/>
<pb n="265" type="orig"/>
by <name type="pname">Napoleon</name> as his landscape designer. According to the landscape historian <name type="pname">Joseph Disponzio</name>, Morel is the French equivalent of Capability <name type="pname">Brown</name> in terms of landscape style.<ref target="#CH7-n47"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">47</hi></hi></ref> Because Morel, like <name type="pname">Brown</name>, saw little value in monuments and structures designed pri-<lb/>
marily for their associative potential rather than their utilitarian function, he and Giradin argued. This led to Morel's retiring from the project and Giradin's pro-<lb/>
ceeding as his own designer as he conceived of how to turn his 2,100-acre estate, which consisted of four sec-<lb/>
tions&#x2014;woods, forest, meadow, and farm&#x2014;into a Pic-<lb/>
turesque landscape composition.</p>
<p>Girardin had visited The Leasowes, <name type="pname">William Shenstone</name>'s English <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi>, and like Shenstone, he and other practitioners of the French Picturesque style preferred close-up views and more intimate effects to the broad panoramas often found in English gardens, a preference espoused by <name type="pname">Rousseau</name> in <hi rend="italic">Julie, ou La Nouvelle H&#x00E9;lo&#x00EF;se</hi>. Although loyal to the sei-<lb/>
gneurial system of property rights and his status as a member of the nobility, in laying out Ermenonville, Girardin also honored <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s prejudice against straight lines, which were symbolical of authoritarian rule.<ref target="#CH7-n48"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">48</hi></hi></ref> Imbued with the philosopher's ideals, he tried to increase agricultural productivity and paternalisti-<lb/>
cally to improve the living conditions of his tenants. He engaged in agricultural experimentation, built cot-<lb/>
tages for his workers, and organized harvest festivals. He had the walls surrounding the old ch&#x00E2;teau pulled down, exposing the public road in order to bring into view the daily movements of ordinary men and women.</p>
<p>Both the north and south views from the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> were composed in the manner of paintings; the view to the south was an Arcadian scene with a lake cradled by wooded hills such as might have come from the brush of <name type="pname">Claude</name>, while the view to the north was a quiet rural view of a flat field with a gently curving stream winding through it (fig. 7.38). The southern perspective was framed by a grotto and cascade, and in the lake stood two islands. The smaller one, ringed with poplars, contained <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s tomb (see fig. 7.36).</p>

<p>One of the most eccentric gardens of the French Picturesque style is that of the D&#x00E9;sert de Retz, which was built in Yvelines outside <name type="place">Paris</name> by <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois Nicolas Henry Racine</name>, baron de Monville (<date when="1734">1734</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797">1797</date>). More personal than a <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chi-<lb/>
nois</hi>, this garden, begun in <date when="1774">1774</date>, contained Gothic ruins from the village church, a weed-clad pyramid (which functioned as an ice house), a Temple of Pan, an open-air theater, and various exotic <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi>. An expert botanist, de Monville cultivated rare plants in his heated greenhouses (the plants were taken to the Jardin des Plantes during the Revolution) and per-<lb/>
formed agricultural experiments on his model farm. Monville abandoned his original house on the prop-<lb/>
erty, the first actual dwelling in the Chinese style in <name type="place">Europe</name>, for an even stranger abode: a colossal broken column (fig. 7.41). Recently restored, this structure has the surreal quality of a painting by <name type="pname">Giorgio de Chirico</name>. Like the work of the twentieth-century artist, it may have been intended as a metaphor portending the loss of classical civilization, as <name type="place">France</name> stood on the brink of upheaval.</p>
<p>In the amorous libertinism and sweet licentious-<lb/>
ness of the youthful figures disporting themselves in the now half-decayed parks of the Age of <name type="pname">Louis XVI</name>, <name type="pname">Jean-Honor&#x00E9; Fragonard</name> (<date when="1732">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806">1806</date>) is perhaps our best guide to a true appreciation of the spirit of the French Picturesque. He captures the haunting, dream-<lb/>

tury gardens, now lapsed into picturesque decrepitude, in such masterpieces as <hi rend="italic">The Swing, The F&#x00EA;te at Saint-Cloud</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Blindman's Buff.

<p>Although <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name> (<date when="1743">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>) did not ini-<lb/>
tiate the picturesque taste in <name type="place">America</name>, he was certainly its most informed and original practitioner in the eigh-<lb/>
teenth century. With a keen intellect well furnished by a good education in classical literature and mathemat-<lb/>
ics, modern science, and English law, he set about improving the estate he had inherited in Albemarle County, <name type="place">Virginia</name>, shortly after completing his studies at the College of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> and the com-<lb/>
mencement of his law practice. He chose for his resi-<lb/>
dence the summit of a hill not far from his father's Shadwell Farm. He called the site Monticello, or "lit-<lb/>
tle mountain," a name that is aptly resonant when we recall the hilly landscape of parts of the Veneto where <name type="pname">Palladio</name>, one source of his architectural inspiration, built several villas. <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> adamantly spurned the vernacular Georgian-style architecture of the Tidewa-<lb/>
ter <name type="place">Virginia</name> plantations, turning to the late Renais-<lb/>
sance architect, like the liberty-loving <name type="pname">Whig</name> aristocrats in <name type="place">England</name>, for a neoclassical style that expressed the idealism of the Enlightenment and optimistically linked the new republic with the imagined political virtues of ancient <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>
<p>While <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> appropriated the union of Palla-<lb/>
dian architecture and naturalistic landscape, as well as the country estate life of husbandry, hunting, and hos-<lb/>
pitality enjoyed by the Whig peers of <name type="place">England</name>, Mon-<lb/>
ticello symbolized a much vaster and peculiarly American dream. They inhabited a small island; he, by contrast, had before him an immensity of sparsely tenanted lands and the new nation's self-granted fran-<lb/>
chise and growing power to lay claim to them. Set upon its eminence, Monticello offered spectacular views of forested mountain ridges growing blue in the distance. They were, in the Burkean sense, sublime. "Where has nature spread so rich a mantle under the eye?" <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> asked rhetorically. "Mountains, for-<lb/>
ests, rocks, rivers. With what majesty do we ride above the storms! How sublime to look down into the workhouse of nature, to see her clouds, hail, snow, thunder, all fabricated at our feet! And the glorious sun when rising as if out of distant water, just gilding the tops of the mountains and giving life to all nature."<ref target="#CH7-n49"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">49</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>But, in spite of this paean to the American wil-<lb/>
derness, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s agenda was fundamentally pasto-<lb/>
ral; his vision of the unfolding landscape was as an unimaginably rich resource, a bounty for future gen-<lb/>
erations. He promoted agriculture as the basis of the young nation's economy, strongly preferring a land of farmers to one in which manufacturing drew people into cities. Whereas <name type="pname">Rousseau</name> had romanticized Geneva as an ideal arena of citizenship, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, who had witnessed the woes of crowded industrial society in <name type="place">England</name> and mob behavior in <name type="place">Paris</name>, saw the town as a necessary evil at best. The virtuous <hi rend="italic">nation-<lb/>
state</hi>, rather than the virtuous <hi rend="italic">city</hi>-state, was his ideal, an ideal made possible by historic circumstance, espe-<lb/>
cially after the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase of <date when="1803">1803</date> gave the country legal claim to an even greater abundance of sparsely settled land. The agreeable vision of <name type="place">Virginia</name> as a kind of paradise and continental <name type="place">America</name> as ful-<lb/>
filling in reality the antique myth of a pastoral Golden Age encouraged his dream of a society of "genuine virtue" in which men preserved their freedom by turn-<lb/>
ing the immense and potentially fruitful wilderness into independently owned farms.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The National Grid</hi></hi></head>
<p>Monticello, with its large workforce of slaves, was the patrician exemplar of rural life. Although <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> might conceive of its landscape as a Picturesque <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi>, his practical mind&#x2014;furnished with the prece-<lb/>
dent of his father, <name type="pname">Peter</name>, a colonial surveyor, and the knowledge imparted by <name type="pname">Dr. William Small</name>, a mathe-<lb/>
matics professor and his mentor at <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>&#x2014;saw the national landscape in Cartesian terms, as susceptible to geometrical planning, subdi-<lb/>
vision, and valorization. In "An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government" (<date when="1690">1690</date>), <name type="pname">John Locke</name> had queried, "What would a man value ten thousand or a hundred thousand acres of excellent land, ready cultivated in the middle of the inland parts of <name type="place">America</name>, where he had no hopes of commerce with other parts of the world, to draw money to him by the sale of the product?" But now the American land had both utilitarian economic potential as well as aesthetic importance for those who, like <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, could indulge in an appreciation of the beautiful, picturesque, and sublime. In either case, this view of it as a commodity&#x2014;real estate&#x2014;to be bought, cultivated, and sometimes designed for delectation ignored the cosmological meaning of cer-<lb/>
tain American landscapes in Native American eyes.</p>
<p>Twenty years before <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> advanced his ideal of a nation of continental proportions with the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase, he had chaired the committee of Congress that prepared a plan for the Northwest Ter-<lb/>
ritory. With <name type="pname">Hugh Williamson</name>, a member from <name type="place">North Carolina</name>, he developed an American version of Roman centuriation in the Land Ordinance of <date when="1785">1785</date>. Instead of allowing settlement as heretofore according to natural topography, the committee set forth a purely mathematical system that would ensure an orderly,
<pb n="268"/>
<pb n="268" type="orig"/>
nondisputatious parceling of land. They established a national grid of 36-mile- (57.9-kilometer-) square townships formed by north-south meridian lines, which were periodically inflected to account for polar convergence, and "range" lines running east-west. The committee further prescribed that the townships be subdivided into 1-mile-square (640-acre) parcels. Sur-<lb/>
veying according to this Land Ordinance began along the <name type="place">Ohio</name> River the following year.</p>

<p>After the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase, it was necessary to account for previous French and Spanish land grants and the presence of certain rivers. Nevertheless, the relentless march of the national grid continued west-<lb/>
ward. The government at this time began to subdivide sale parcels into quarter sections of 160 acres, then into half-quarter sections of 80 acres, and finally, after <date when="1832">1832</date>, into quarter-quarter sections of 40 acres. One only has to fly across the United States to see from the air how, with only a few surveying eccentricities and exemptions for reasons of prior set-<lb/>

After the return of <name type="pname">Lewis</name> and <name type="pname">Clark</name> in <date when="1806">1806</date>, he directed the distribution of seeds from their expedition to nurserymen, fellow gardeners, and botanical gardens. <name type="pname">Dr. David Hosack</name> of the Elgin Botanical Garden in <name type="place">New York</name> (now the site of Rocke-<lb/>
feller Center) was among those who received some expedition seeds. In <date when="1813">1813</date>, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> asked <name type="pname">Bernard McMahon</name>, a <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> seed grower and plant prop-<lb/>
agator with whom he maintained an extensive corre-<lb/>
spondence and from whom he ordered many seeds, bulbs, and plants for Monticello, to return Thouin's many favors to him by preparing for shipment to <name type="place">Paris</name> a collection of the seeds and plants from beyond the Mississippi. Thus, in a period of intense botanical exploration and horticultural experiment, were friend-<lb/>

<p>Although <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> found great personal stimulus in cosmopolitan social intercourse and sometimes grew melancholy from a superabundance of unrelieved sol-<lb/>
itude, and although he was experimental rather than managerial by nature and too involved in statecraft and public duties to make a financial success of his own agricultural enterprises, his devotion to Monticello, and later to his other estate, Poplar Forest, was vital and constant. Before it became a magnet for visitors after his retirement from public life, Monticello was his retreat where he could pursue his interest in science and philosophy, thanks to his superb library. It was also his agricultural and horticultural experimental station and the place where he first exercised his talents as an architect and landscape designer.</p>
<p>Methodical by nature, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> faithfully kept a Garden Book in which he noted the planting, bloom, and harvest times of various fruits, flowers, and vege-<lb/>
tables. Through this as well as from various architec-<lb/>
tural diagrams and sketches and from the lively correspondence he carried on with nurserymen and
<pb n="269"/>
<pb n="269" type="orig"/>
gardening friends at home and abroad, there emerges not merely the chronicle of the creation of a famous landscape, but also the personality of an eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century polymath, self-taught architect, and natural scientist. From the Garden Book and his also reliably kept Account Book we learn that, in <date when="1767">1767</date>, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> supervised the sawing of lumber and the planting of fruit trees at the Monticello site; in the fol-<lb/>
lowing year, he let a contract to level the summit; and in the year after that, he had the foundations dug for his new house. A brick kiln was put in operation and hard-<lb/>
ware ordered from <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Jefferson</name> owned four editions of <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Quat-<lb/>
tro libri dell'architettura</hi> (<date when="1570">1570</date>) in which the Venetian architect illustrated the elements of his style. He also owned <hi rend="italic">Select Architecture</hi> by the eighteenth-century Palladian and classical theorist <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name>. But he did not adhere to <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s or to any other architec-<lb/>
tural book in an academic fashion. Guided by the already derivative and much-altered Palladianism of <name type="place">England</name>, he chose to combine ideas and adapt design forms drawn from several sources to his own sense of utility and comfort. These included the saucer dome over Monticello's parlor, derived from the H&#x00F4;tel de Salm in <name type="place">Paris</name>, the construction of which he had watched with lively interest in <date when="1796">1796</date> during the period he served as minister to <name type="place">France</name>. However, lacking stone and sculptors to carve it, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> eschewed French ornamental elegance; Monticello, with its sim-<lb/>
ple native brick and chaste classical detailing in white-<lb/>
painted wood carved by master joiners brought from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, retains an original <hi rend="italic">American</hi>-Palladian flavor (fig. 7.44). The service basement was screened by a long arcaded portico similar to those found in the courtyards of <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s villas; however, the one at Monticello was partially buried in the hillside in order to make the movement of many household slaves and other menials as inconspicuous as possible.</p>
<p>Even before the house was built, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> began collecting trees and shrubs and sowing seed for vege-<lb/>
tables and flowers. He embellished the area in front of the entrance on the east with a hemicycle of flowering shrubs. In addition to planting the orchard and a kitchen garden on the southern slope, he laid out a horseshoe-shaped lawn to the west along the flattened top of the hill. Though clearly of a rationalistic, scientific, and utilitarian bent, his mind was also inclined toward the Romanticism of <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>. The melancholy potential of the rural cemetery with mon-<lb/>
uments and elegiac inscriptions gripped his imagina-<lb/>
tion, and he understood from his reading about English gardens the associative value of temples, grottoes, urns, and texts in stone. Thus, in <date when="1771">1771</date>, he thought about choosing for "a Burying place some unfre-<lb/>
quented vale in the park &#x2026; among antient and vener-<lb/>
able oaks." He planned to erect in the center of this grove "a small Gothic temple of antique appearance, into which would be admitted very little light, perhaps none at all, save only the feeble ray of an half extin-<lb/>
guished lamp."<ref target="#CH7-n50"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">50</hi></hi></ref> He also envisioned channeling a stream into a cistern, which might serve as a pool for bathing. At the mouth of the spring he would carve a grotto, to be decorated with translucent pebbles and beautiful shells and in which a sculpture of a sleeping nymph, like the one to be found at <name type="pname">Henry Hoare</name>'s Stourhead, would rest on a couch of moss. Other proj-<lb/>
ects engrossed his imagination, including a cascade and various eye-catchers on Mount Alto across from Monticello. But while it was in his nature to fantasize architecture and daydream about Picturesque garden scenes, these projects inevitably took a back seat to his more pragmatic horticultural interests. No temple ever rose at Monticello, no grotto was built to adorn a spring, and instead of the Romantic burial ground, a simple square graveyard enclosed by a fence was established in <date when="1773">1773</date>. Being both practical and artistic, the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> offered him a more pragmatic land-<lb/>
scape paradigm for his improvement of Monticello's grounds. As might be expected, he possessed a copy of <name type="pname">William Shenstone</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (<date when="1764">1764</date>), which he had purchased a year after its publication when he was only twenty-two.</p>

<p>In <date when="1786">1786</date>, he acquired the second (<date when="1770">1770</date>) edition of <name type="pname">Whately</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</hi>, and it was with a copy of this book in hand that he set forth during the months of March and April with fellow American <name type="pname">John Adams</name>, on a systematic tour of English landscape gardens. For <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> the purpose of the tour was to inquire into "such practical things as might enable me to estimate the expense of making and maintaining a garden in that style."<ref target="#CH7-n51"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">51</hi></hi></ref> Throughout his travels, he dis-<lb/>
played his independence of taste and bias in favor of natural simplicity, criticizing <name type="pname">Chiswick</name> for its "useless" obelisks and for showing "still too much of art," characterizing Stowe's straight approach as "very ill," and faulting <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>'s thin scattering of trees and "small thickets of shrubs, in oval raised beds" where there should have been "fine lawn and woods." However, he liked the way the sight line between the Temple of Friendship and the Temple of <name type="pname">Venus</name> at Stowe passed "not through the garden, but through the country parallel to the line of the garden" and how "the Grecian valley being clear of trees, while the hill on each side is covered with them, is much deepened to appearance." And at <name type="pname">Blenheim</name> he had to admit that, in spite of his judgment that "this garden has no great beauties," he was impressed with the cascade and the lake, finding "the water here is very beautiful, very grand."<ref target="#CH7-n52"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">52</hi></hi></ref> With an abundance of fine native plants, the creation of Ameri-<lb/>
can gardens was, he thought optimistically, more a mat-<lb/>
ter of pruning and editing out what was unwanted.</p>
<p>On his retirement from public life in <date when="1809">1809</date>, <name type="pname">Jeffer-<lb/>
son</name> set in motion a final campaign of landscaping at Monticello. He enlarged the terraced vegetable garden south of the central lawn to a length 1,000 feet (304.8 meters), beautified it with a small garden pavilion, and rearranged its beds so as to make it more agreeable for viewing from above. He laid out a serpentine path within the horseshoe-shaped lawn and created oval beds where he could display the many species of bulbs and flowers that he continually collected. He built a ha-ha to separate the lawn and pleasure grounds from the agri-<lb/>
cultural landscape. He constructed three circular drives, or roundabouts, each one progressively larger in cir-<lb/>
cumference, for touring the property Between the sec-<lb/>
ond and third he planted various experimental crops.</p>
<p>To his gardening friend <name type="pname">William Hamilton</name>, the owner of The Woodlands in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> wrote in <date when="1806">1806</date> near the end of his second presidential term and in anticipation of his resumption of active gar-<lb/>
dening at Monticello, speculating upon how, in the cli-<lb/>
mate of <name type="place">Virginia</name>, which was benign and favorable to horticulture but yet too warm in summer to be as com-<lb/>
fortable as the "sunless climate" of <name type="place">England</name>, one could achieve some of the same effects. Whereas in <name type="place">England</name>, "they need no more of wood than will serve to embrace a lawn or glade &#x2026; under the beaming, constant and almost vertical sun of <name type="place">Virginia</name>, shade is our Elysium."<ref target="#CH7-n53"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">53</hi></hi></ref> He proposed removing as many of the lower limbs of trees as possible without harming or marring the appear-<lb/>
ance of the tree in order to have simultaneously an appearance of open lawn and a shady canopy. At the same time, he was shaping Poplar Forest&#x2014;a separate farm where he raised merino sheep, dairy cattle, and pigs and grew tobacco as a cash crop&#x2014;into a refuge from the steady stream of visitors that now flowed through the doors of Monticello.</p>

<p>Like Pliny the Younger savoring the bucolic atmo-<lb/>
sphere of his Tusci villa in the first century or the heads of noble Venetian families spending the <hi rend="italic">villeggiatura</hi> in their Palladian mansions in the agricultural Veneto in the sixteenth, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> viewed Poplar Forest idyllically. In <date when="1811">1811</date>, writing from there to the portrait painter <name type="pname">Charles Willson Peale</name>, he affirmed his continuing enthusiasm for his lifelong avocation:
<q>
<p>I have often thought that if heaven had given me choice of my position and calling, it should have been on a rich spot of earth, well watered, and near a good market for the productions of the garden. No occupation is so delightful to me as the culture of the earth, and no culture comparable to that of the garden. &#x2026; But though an old man, I am but a young gardener.<ref target="#CH7-n54"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">54</hi></hi></ref></p>
</q></p>
<p>In truth, mathematics and architecture&#x2014;his other lifelong avocations&#x2014;focused his imagination and tal-<lb/>
ent as a designer on the opportunity represented by Pop-<lb/>
lar Forest even more than his delight in gardening. In his political and social theory, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> embraced a wide intellectual range, sometimes encompassing con-<lb/>
tradictory perspectives. His pastoralism and antiurbanism, for instance, were incon-<lb/>
sistent with the growth of an independent manufactur-<lb/>
ing economy in <name type="place">America</name>, which he advanced as a matter of national expedience. When compared with Monticello, Poplar Forest, a project of mathematically derived proportions and geometrical forms, demon-<lb/>
strates that as a landscape designer he was equally capa-<lb/>
ble of pursuing divergent ends. In his library was a copy of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>'s <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pratique du jardinage</hi>, and in <date when="1805">1805</date>, at the time he was planning the Poplar Forest villa, he purchased <name type="pname">Wilhelm Gottlieb Becker</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Neue Garten-und Landschafts-Geb&#x00E4;ude</hi> (<date when="1798">1798</date>) in which there is a plate illustrating an octagonal garden pavilion with a central space that is 20 feet (6.1 meters) square, a plan that also calls to mind in its sym-<lb/>
metry and four equally prominent facades <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s
<pb n="271"/>
<pb n="271" type="orig"/>
Villa Rotonda. Transforming the villa's measurements to a ratio of 2:5 (the obverse of the Golden Section), <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> designed an octagonal house 50 feet (15.2 meters) in diameter with a central room measuring 20 feet (6.1 meters) to a side, which serves as the linchpin of his geometrical landscape design (figs. 7.45a, 7.45b).</p>
<p>Although <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was familiar with D&#x00E9;zallier, Poplar Forest's landscape was no formulaic applica-<lb/>
tion of French garden theory and practice. His inter-<lb/>
ests in mathematics and classical history became increasingly important pastimes in his retirement, for as he confided to <name type="pname">John Adams</name> in <date when="1812">1812</date>, "I have given up newspapers in exchange for Tacitus and Thucy-<lb/>
dides, for <name type="pname">Newton</name> and <name type="pname">Euclid</name>; and I find myself much the happier." At Poplar Forest, interlocking mathemat-<lb/>
ical shapes&#x2014;circles, squares, and squared circles, or octagons&#x2014;are composed within the framework of a 100-foot (30.5-meter) modular system. Its design has cosmological overtones, the mandala-like image of its landscape plan coincidentally echoing forms and alignments found in prehistoric cultures. Its principal entrance faces due north, and its octagonal shape allows for fenestration that is oriented to the Blue Ridge, the Peaks of Otter, and other important local mountains. The entry drive has a circular terminus like that at Mount Vernon, but here its circularity is made emphatic by an outer ring of boxwood trees and an inner concentric ring of five dwarf boxwood hedges, which are divided into four sections by being broken at the cardinal points. <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> had the south lawn graded to form a grass <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi>, or bowling green. It, too, is more mathematically pronounced than the one at Mount Vernon, being exactly 100 feet (30.5 meters) wide by 200 feet (61 meters) long.</p>
<p>Poplar Forest's most unusual design feature, two cir-<lb/>
cular 12-foot- (3.7-meter-) high mounds placed 100 feet equidistant from the east and west fronts of the house, had four willows planted on their tops. These formed a 20-foot (6.1-meter) square&#x2014;the same dimension and shape as the central room of the octa-<lb/>
gon. More willows encircled the mounds at their mid-<lb/>
point, and at their bases, which are 100 feet (30.5 meters) in diameter, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> planted an outer ring of aspens. The entire composition of house, dependen-<lb/>
cies, and garden was encompassed by a circular ring road 500 feet (152.4 meters) in diameter. This road was lined with paper mulberries, prized by <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> for the regularity of their form. Thus, in the end, did <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s penchant for mathematical relationships and classical geometries prevail over the tendency toward the Picturesque as expressed in his daydream of a dimly lit Gothic temple as his burial chamber on the grounds of Monticello. This affinity for rational form and proportion is apparent not only at Poplar Forest but also in his last great building project, the University of <name type="place">Virginia</name>.</p>

found this institution had long germinated in his mind. He felt that his alma mater, the College of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>, was moribund and poorly situated in compari-<lb/>
son to the healthful hilltop that was chosen near Char-<lb/>
lottesville after the <name type="place">Virginia</name> legislature enacted the bill in <date when="1819">1819</date> to create the university that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> had envi-<lb/>
sioned. It would not be, like <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> or other colleges and universities, housed in a large indi-<lb/>
vidual building; instead, it would be "an academical village" with "a small separate lodge for each separate professorship &#x2026; the whole of these arranged around an open square of grass and trees."<ref target="#CH7-n55"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">55</hi></hi></ref> Scholars have speculated upon where <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> may have gotten the idea of separate pavilions lining either side of an axial greensward, which is closed at one end by a central dominant structure. It is known that during the time he was living in <name type="place">Paris</name> he visited <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s Ch&#x00E2;teau de Marly where such an arrangement exists, and he may have retained an image of this landscape in his mind's eye as he set about planning the university and its grounds (see fig. 5.15).</p>

This document depicts <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s original interior of the Rotonda as three oval chambers. It also shows the progressively increasing width of the gardens outlined by serpentine walls running between the pavilions and the dormitories. This resulted from <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s desire to counteract optical foreshortening by incrementally lengthening the distance between the pavilions on either side of the lawn to accommodate the perspective along the central axis from the vantage point of the Rotunda.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>Although <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was clear in regard to his design intentions, he consulted with <name type="pname">William Thornton</name> (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">1828</date>), the architect of the <name type="place">United States Capi-<lb/>
tol</name>, and <name type="pname">Benjamin Henry Latrobe</name> (<date when="1764">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">1820</date>), who also worked on this project and many other important public buildings in the young republic. <name type="pname">Latrobe</name> con-<lb/>
firmed <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> in his predilection for a rotunda at the end of the axis framed by the pavilions, and <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> decided to use as his model the Pantheon in <name type="place">Rome</name> (fig. 7.46). He deftly employed false perspective in placing the pavilions at increasing intervals to counteract the appearance of spatial compression that occurs when one views aligned objects that are equidistant from one another. Further defining the axis and providing a cov-<lb/>
ered walkway for faculty and students in inclement weather, he decided to connect the five pavilions on either side with a colonnade. Although <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> could not have been familiar with the stoas found in ancient Greek agoras and gymnasiums, in both form and func-<lb/>
tion this pair of colonnades, which are linked with the colonnaded wings of the Rotunda, may be considered a distant cousin to the stoas where Plato, Aristotle, and other peripatetic teachers met their pupils.</p>
<p>Behind the academic pavilions were the dormi-<lb/>
tories. Between each pavilion and dormitory <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> defined a garden space by means of serpentine walls (fig. 7.47). He also established a botanical garden, which was later replaced by Cabell Hall. That one end of the axis was open was an important element of <name type="pname">Jef-<lb/>
ferson</name>'s landscape composition at the University of <name type="place">Virginia</name>. He wished to project the view in this direc-<lb/>
<pb n="273"/>
<pb n="273" type="orig"/>
tion to the distant mountains. This scenic gesture was, however, subsequently destroyed by a Neoclassical building built by the Beaux-Arts architect <name type="pname">Stanford White</name> (<date when="1853">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1906">1906</date>) athwart the axis, thereby closing it at both ends.</p>
<p>That <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> practiced within the Picturesque design tradition of <name type="place">England</name> and simultaneously employed the Cartesian geometries of <name type="place">France</name> shows the breadth of his intellect and the depth of his interest in nature, land-<lb/>
scape, and design. His essays at Monticello, Poplar Forest, and the University of <name type="place">Virginia</name> belong to a long aristocratic tradition of garden design. It is significant in this regard that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was a man much at home in the French court, an Enlightenment rationalist whose fundamental design preference was for Neoclassical forms. It is important to remember also that he was a slave owner as well as the author of the Declaration of Independence. In assessing his importance to the land-<lb/>
scape of <name type="place">America</name>, we must not forget that he expressed the country's future as a democratic (and commercial) society in his deployment of the nonhierarchical national grid as a means of subdividing the continent and selling its land. Of particular importance to his nineteenth-century successors, including especially <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson Downing</name> and <name type="pname">Frederick Law Olm-<lb/>
sted</name>, was his pastoral vision of an agricultural society and a nation vast enough to accom-modate those aspects of the nascent industrial technology as would benefit it but still leave it unscarred, unpolluted, and un-urban. This was his hopeful, and, in retrospect, poi-<lb/>
gnant legacy to the American landscape.</p>

<p>At the same time that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was attempting to craft a rational vision for the supremely Romantic challenge of settling a nation of continental proportions, European intellectuals grappled with the revolutionary forces that were beginning to unsettle old concepts of order. The ideals of political revolution were inherent in Romanti-<lb/>
cism's allegiance to the innate worth of the individual. The old order was fading; aristocratic privilege was gradually being supplanted by notions of equality. Increasingly, entitlement would have less to do with hereditary titles than with the concept of life, liberty, and happiness as the birthright of all human beings. Even in countries that were still monarchies, political systems were evolving that would support in a greater degree than heretofore this ideal of individual rights and, with the advent of industrial capitalism, the ability of many individuals besides members of the landhold-<lb/>
ing class to affect the order of society and the condition and appearance of their surroundings. Two towering late eighteenth-century figures who were contemporar-<lb/>
ies of <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, <name type="pname">Goethe</name> and <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>, stood squarely in the currents of societal transition.

ity into the realm of garden design as into many other realms of art and science. His influence in this area, however, was less as a designer than as a shaper of the cultural matrix within which the associative potential of nature was directed toward sentimental ends and land-<lb/>
scape employed as a theater to enrapture the human mind.</p>
<p>His first novel, <hi rend="italic">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</hi> (The Sorrows of <name type="pname">Young Werther</name>, <date when="1774">1774</date>), had an even more profound effect on his contemporaries than had <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s immensely popular <hi rend="italic">Julie, on la Nouvelle H&#x00E9;lo&#x00EF;se</hi> when published a few years earlier. <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">Werther</hi></name> turned <name type="pname"><name type="pname">Goethe</name></name> overnight into a figure of international renown, and served as a catalyst for the new <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> (Storm and Stress) literary movement, which emphasized the validity of human emotion, impulse, instinct, intuition, and feeling.

Altertums</hi> (History of the Art of Antiquity, <date when="1764">1764</date>), helped <name type="pname">Goethe</name> to discriminate among ancient periods and styles. Winckelmann taught his readers to prefer the cool Olympian grandeur and humanism of Athens to the more worldly and materialistic power of <name type="place">Rome</name>, and it was probably through Winckelmann's influence that <name type="pname">Goethe</name> came to cherish the temple-studded land-<lb/>
scape of Magna Graecia, the ancient Greek colonies in southern <name type="place">Italy</name> and Sicily.</p>
<p>In <date when="1775">1775</date>, having completed his law studies at Leipzig and Strasburg and embarked upon a life of lit-<lb/>
erature and intellectual achievement, <name type="pname">Goethe</name> took up permanent residence at the court of the provincial duchy of Weimar, where he had gone on a visit to the reigning duke, <name type="pname">Carl August</name>. Here his protean talents propelled him into a multiplicity of projects as he per-<lb/>
formed various political and administrative duties, oversaw mining operations, chaired commissions on war and highways, wrote and directed plays, composed poetry, accompanied the duke on military forays and diplomatic errands, pursued botany and other natural sciences, and even found time to design gardens.</p>
<p>In <date when="1778-05">May 1778</date>, in order to assess the political implications of the threatened war between <name type="place">Prussia</name> and <name type="place">Austria</name>, <name type="pname">Carl August</name> took <name type="pname">Goethe</name> with him to <name type="place">Ber-<lb/>
lin</name>, and both on the way to and from the Prussian cap-<lb/>
ital they stopped at W&#x00F6;rlitz, the park of <name type="pname">Prince Franz</name> of Anhalt-Dessau (<date when="1740">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817">1817</date>) and one of the first landscapes to be created in <name type="place">Germany</name> in the English style (fig. 7.48). The prince was a talented amateur and, with professional assistance from the landscape gardeners <name type="pname">Johann George Schoch</name> (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>) and <name type="pname">Johann Friedrich Eyserbeck</name> (<date when="1734">1734</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818">1818</date>), was in the process of creating a garden of some 58 square miles (150 square kilometers) within his extensive properties along the Elbe.</p>
<p>Although the prince, <name type="pname">Schoch</name>, and <name type="pname">Eyserbeck</name> all traveled to <name type="place">England</name> to study the latest trends in gar-<lb/>
dens there, they eschewed the design formulas of <name type="pname">Capability Brown</name> and <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s version of the Pictur-<lb/>
esque in favor of the greater associative potential of sham ruins and inscribed monuments, as found in ear-<lb/>
lier English gardens such as Stowe and Stourhead. Nor was there at W&#x00F6;rlitz the desire to unite the palace visu-<lb/>
ally with its surrounding landscape as <name type="pname">Brown</name> had done at <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>. Within W&#x00F6;rlitz's <hi rend="italic">ferme-orn&#x00E9;e</hi> landscape, many structures were given classical facades, even including some farm buildings and the observation stations on the dikes that controlled the flow of the Elbe into the long W&#x00F6;rlitz lake. <name type="pname">Goethe</name> found the scene enchanting.</p>

<p>Because of <name type="pname">Chambers</name>'s influence and also that of the British volcanologist and ambassador to Naples, <name type="pname">William Hamilton</name>, who through his publications on Mount Vesuvius had stimulated a Romantic taste for volcanoes, W&#x00F6;rlitz boasts the Stein, Schoch's simula-<lb/>
tion of one at garden scale. The Stein, a hollow rock construction rising some 80 feet (24.4 meters) high and situated on an island within a branch of the lake, was built between <date when="1788">1788</date> and <date when="1790">1790</date>. <name type="pname">Goethe</name> therefore could not have seen it when he made his first trip to W&#x00F6;rlitz, but the prince's guest book attests to another visit paid on <date when="1794-07-27">July 27, 1794</date>, and <name type="pname">Goethe</name> is reported to have made one or more sketches of it then as it "erupted." This theatrical event was usually accom-<lb/>
plished at night by pumping fire and smoke out of its crater while pouring water over the lip of the cone into which were set pieces of red-tinted glass illumined from the inside. The eerie glow of the reddish light beneath the tumbling water thus gave the impression of molten lava.</p>
<p>Contemporary philosophy provides a key to our understanding of the appeal of this and other similar tricks. In its exposition of the soul's function as a per-<lb/>
ceiving organ, the seat of all ideas and emotions, a passive receptacle of impressions as well as an active

force, <name type="pname">Johann Georg Sulzer</name>'s treatise, translated as <hi rend="italic">Enquiry into the Origin of Pleasant and Unpleasant Sensations</hi> in <date when="1752">1752</date>, codified the principles inherent in the <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> movement and provided the the-<lb/>
oretical basis for the psychology underlying German sentimentalism. In <date when="1762">1762</date>, the Scottish theoretician <name type="pname">Henry Home</name>, <name type="pname">Lord Kames</name> (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782">1782</date>) published his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Criticism</hi>, which treated gardening as a branch of the fine arts. According to Kames, through the consideration of the specific sentimental values adhering to particular scenes and their arrangement within the landscape, designers could make the garden a source of emotional inspiration.</p>
<p>The writings of <name type="pname">Christian Lorenz Hirschfeld</name> (<date when="1742">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">1792</date>), the Danish professor of aesthetics at Kiel University in Schleswig-Holstein, were also important to the development of the sentimentalist gar-<lb/>
den and to the course of landscape design in <name type="place">Germany</name>. Between <date when="1779">1779</date> and <date when="1785">1785</date>, he produced his five-volume <hi rend="italic">Theorie der Gartenkunst</hi> (Theory of Garden Art). Pub-<lb/>
lished simultaneously in German and French, this work attempted to explicate the evolution of landscape design while articulating a specifically German point of view toward it. <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name> saw prehistoric antiquity as a time of felicity and oneness with nature. Subse-<lb/>
quently, although the ancient Greeks were not garden designers, the manner in which their temples were sit-<lb/>
uated in nature illustrates the harmony that existed between human beings and landscape in antiquity. <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name> valued the virtues of the villa tradition of republican <name type="place">Rome</name>, with its fruitful husbandry com-<lb/>
bined with scholarly leisure, and he lamented its degeneration, as illustrated by the excessive grandeur and too lavish use of ornament in the gardens of impe-<lb/>
rial <name type="place">Rome</name>. Similarly, he held that the aggrandizement of the garden by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his followers was inim-<lb/>
ical to the happiness of the individual, for the French gardens, intended primarily as social settings, defeated the need of the individual to disengage from society for self-renewal and self-discovery in nature.</p>
<p>The English garden, in <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s opinion, thus offered a positive antidote to the French-style gardens that then prevailed in the Gennan principalities because the English garden was more conducive to reflection and provided a relaxed setting for personal spontaneity and simple, unaffected behavior. He saw the garden as a zone of mediation between art and nature, society and solitude, a prescriptive force for entering a state of civ-<lb/>
ilized innocence and socialized freedom.</p>
<p>Underlying <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s work was another motive, that of nationalism. Whereas in <name type="place">England</name> the nationalism espoused by Whig liberals found direct <hi rend="italic">political</hi> expression (as well as symbolic expression in the garden), in <name type="place">Germany</name>, which was fragmented into principalities, the forging of national identity was nec-<lb/>
essarily through <hi rend="italic">culture</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Volk</hi>, the German people, were sustained by a venerable racial mythology, which was later dramatized in the operas of the nine-<lb/>
teenth-century composer <name type="pname">Richard Wagner</name>. German utopianism, as found in <name type="pname">Friedrich Schiller</name>'s poem "An die Freude" (<date when="1785">1785</date>) and <name type="pname">Ludwig van Beethoven</name>'s Ninth Symphony (<date when="1824">1824</date>), was infused with joy in nature, and this joy in nature&#x2014;the nature of dark for-<lb/>
ests and great rivers and green fields&#x2014;could help to form a new national character, one that in <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s view should be tempered with art. Affect&#x2014;feeling and emotion as opposed to cognition and reason&#x2014;was for him the guiding principle in garden design. Taste, a prized eighteenth-century virtue, had a moral dimen-<lb/>
sion. In the same way as the ancient Greeks had both humanized and deified the larger landscape with their significantly sited temples and shrines, the contempo-<lb/>
rary German garden designer could uplift the spirit through the embellished natural landscape. The viewer could then create his own mental garden of noble asso-<lb/>
ciations and lofty ideals.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s "Gennan" garden style provided the soil in which to cultivate the seeds of nationalism and regional pride. Patriotism and community spirit were to be instilled through "portraits of those men &#x2026; to whom we owe enlightenment, freedom, prosperity, pleasure."<ref target="#CH7-n56"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">56</hi></hi></ref> Classical temples, even devoid of any con-<lb/>
temporary reference, would give the landscape "useful, instructive truth," but those dedicated to Peace, Love, or some similar desideratum, or to a particular individ-<lb/>
ual's valor or contribution to humanity, would be even more desirable. The "borrowed scenery" of village church spires and other distant views would remind onlookers of the reciprocal relationship between nature and humanity and of the garden's place in the larger realm of society. Real heroes were to be preferred to mythological ones, and vernacular, rather than classi-<lb/>
cal, inscriptions were recommended. <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name> is the father of the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi>, in which monuments com-<lb/>
memorating a shared history and common cultural val-<lb/>
ues fostered national identity.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> was intended as a place where people of all classes could congregate in an atmo-<lb/>
sphere that combined the cultural influence of archi-<lb/>
tectural features, statues, and inscriptions with the beauty of nature. Enlightened aristocrats eagerly appropriated <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s concepts. In Munich, in <date when="1789">1789</date>, <name type="pname">Elector Karl Theodor</name> commissioned <name type="pname">Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell</name> (<date when="1750">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823">1823</date>) and the American expatriate <name type="pname">Benjamin Thompson</name> (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814">1814</date>) to lay out the Englischer Garten where native tree species and natural water courses form the scenic backdrop for various architectural features of a classical and exotic

nature. More didactic by its greater inclusion of statues of royal personages and cultural and military heroes was <name type="pname">Peter Joseph Lenn&#x00E9;</name>'s redesign in <date when="1818">1818</date> of <name type="place">Berlin</name>'s Tiergarten as a <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> (fig. 7.49). The two popu-<lb/>
lar public parks exemplify the transition going on in <name type="place">Germany</name> as an aristocratic perspective with its linger-<lb/>
ing fancy for temples and <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi> gave way under changing circumstances to the values of a bourgeois society that desired a conservative imagery expressing the authority of the state.</p>

</figure>
<p><name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s influence presided over the way this cultural shift was translated into the designed land-<lb/>
scape. He saw the necessity for certain modifications to the sentimentalist garden ideal in such public spaces as these. In the interests of accommodating crowds of promenaders and of increasing security, he recom-<lb/>
mended broad straight paths in some areas rather than winding, irregular ones. He felt that "comfort and security demand that the roads for wagons and horse-<lb/>
back riders be kept separate from the paths of the pedestrians."<ref target="#CH7-n57"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">57</hi></hi></ref> In addition to "good lessons &#x2026; scat-<lb/>
tered along a path followed for entertainment,"<ref target="#CH7-n58"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">58</hi></hi></ref> there should be places for group assembly and amusement as well as such practical amenities as rain shelters, rowboat concessions, and refreshment stands. <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> is a forerunner of the public park as developed a few years later by <name type="pname">John Claudius Loudon</name>, <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson Downing</name>, <name type="pname">Calvert Vaux</name>, and <name type="pname">Frederick Law Olmsted</name> (see Chapter Nine).</p>
<p>In <date when="1784">1784</date>, with <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Theorie der Garten-<lb/>
kunst</hi> as a guide and advice from the prince of Anhalt-Dessau, <name type="pname">Goethe</name> helped <name type="pname">Duke Karl August</name> undertake certain improvements in the valley of the Ilm where they hoped to create a park in the Romantic style, following the one at W&#x00F6;rlitz. He and the duke planned a riverbank grotto, and he oversaw in an ash grove in the most secluded part of the valley the con-<lb/>
struction of the Luisenkloster, a wooden "hermitage" with a thatched roof and moss-lined walls.</p>
<p>But for <name type="pname">Goethe</name>'s capacious and restless intellect, the limitations of the sentimentalist garden and exces-<lb/>
sive worship at the altar of nature were becoming apparent. The extraordinary popularity of <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">Werther</hi></name> had become an embarrassment to him; <name type="pname">Werther</name>'s tragic ending, to say nothing of the youthful suicides made fashionable by its apparent advocacy of emotional excess, was now for <name type="pname">Goethe</name> an implicit indictment of the <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> movement. Indeed, within the novel the seeds of revulsion against excessive Roman-<lb/>
ticism had already been sown. Nature&#x2014;sublime and infinite nature&#x2014;"which overwhelmed [<name type="pname">Werther</name>] with so great a joy and made the world &#x2026; a very paradise" could also be a torturing demon, "a monster forever devouring, regurgitating, chewing and gorging."<ref target="#CH7-n59"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">59</hi></hi></ref> For all its intricate and miraculous diversity, its capacity to stir the senses, excite the imagination and move the soul, nature was a sublimely indifferent force, not the philosophical key to life's meaning.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> itself, the Romanticist's means of experiencing life, that <name type="pname">Werther</name>'s predica-<lb/>
ment brought into question. Even reason failed to pro-<lb/>
vide a refuge for the restless spirit's quest for ultimate meaning. <name type="pname">Goethe</name> tried and failed to find in botanical science a fundamental unity that would bespeak a pur-<lb/>
pose analogous to divine purpose, now discredited by <name type="pname">Deism</name>. Yet in the end his search for the <hi rend="italic">Urpflanze</hi>, or primal plant from which all others were but deriva-<lb/>
tions, proved unsuccessful as did his efforts to sup-<lb/>
plant Linnaeus's system with his attempted <hi rend="italic">Harmonia plantarum</hi>. It had become increasingly clear that sci-<lb/>
ence and religion could no longer be unified in a single philosophical framework; the human mind would henceforth find meaning in its own lifetime journey, taking such consolation as could be found from the realm of art.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Goethe</name> explored the dilemma of modern human-<lb/>
ity in which the comforts of religion diminish as the dogmas of the Church are devalued and science&#x2014;however cleverly constructed and beautifully pat-<lb/>
terned its productions might be&#x2014;merely underscores the randomness of all life and the indifference of the universe. His masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, can be read as the clarion call of modernity and as the text that spells the end of the Enlightenment. Pope's confident assertion that after <name type="pname">Newton</name> "all was light," is countered in <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> not by a "devil's advocate," but by the devil himself, that agent of Darkness, Mephistopheles, who mocks Faust's mystical yearning for oneness with nature.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Goethe</name>, while pointing the way to the future, was one of the last exponents of a cosmopolitan humanism in which classical culture could still provide a working vocabulary for artists. Like <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>, he sought the <hi rend="italic">Mittelweg</hi>, or middle way, a compromise between clas-<lb/>
sicism and Romanticism, reason and emotion, sense and sensibility. In <hi rend="italic">Die Wahlverwandtschaften</hi> ("Elec-<lb/>
<pb n="277"/>
<pb n="277" type="orig"/>
tive Affinities," <date when="1809">1809</date>), the garden becomes a metaphor for the tension created by these polarities within the fabric of society and within the marriage contract. The old gardener regrets that the geometrical garden of former days is now unused and no longer appreciated, while the newly created Romantic garden with its moss hut and sweeping views of picturesque village and countryside becomes the locus of tragedy. Excessive sentiment and unheeded wisdom pro-<lb/>
vide <name type="pname">Goethe</name>'s recipe for doom. This tale of unchecked extramarital passion is interwoven with the narrative of the garden-building project, which the aristocratic owners find to be merely a palliative for the boredom of an otherwise idle existence.</p>
<p>But the forces of cultural as well as political revolu-<lb/>
tion had been unleashed, and these proved far too power-<lb/>
ful to be restrained. The seeds of German nationalism that had been sown by German Romanticism would flower satanically in the evils of the twentieth century. But Romanticism's legacy has another side. One might say that, by questioning the existence of God and looking for higher meaning in nature, the human race had discovered the true measure of the soul or, put another way&#x2014;<name type="pname">Word-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">William Wordsworth</name> (<date when="1770">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850">1850</date>) embraced the Roman-<lb/>
tic movement in all its radical and revolutionary dimen-<lb/>
sions, celebrating as did his fellow poets <name type="pname">Blake</name>, <name type="pname">Coleridge</name>, <name type="pname">Keats</name>, <name type="pname">Shelley</name>, and <name type="pname">Byron</name>, the tremendous political, sex-<lb/>
ual, imaginative, and spiritual energy that it released pre-<lb/>
cisely when the Industrial Revolution was unleashing unprecedented forces of mechanical energy. Written in the wake of the French and American Revolutions, <name type="pname">Word-<lb/>
sworth</name>'s poetry is one of affirmation in which egalitarian-<lb/>
ism is eagerly endorsed, both politically and in terms of the rights of the human mind (<hi rend="italic">all</hi> human minds) to gain access to emotion and experience. For <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>, the human heart is the common property of humanity, and the poet's task is to reveal, through imagination and language, images and ideas that will cause people to exercise this emotional birthright.</p>
<p>Simplicity, purity of response, and the innocent won-<lb/>
der of childhood are more important to <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> than elegant expression and enlightened discourse. Na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9; has its own profundity, and <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> is all. Nature unadorned, shorn of ornament and allusion, is capable of inspiring the loftiest thoughts. The rainbow, much cherished by <name type="pname">Word-<lb/>
sworth</name> as a symbol, stands for our covenant with nature, a covenant in which our own infinitely renewable imagina-<lb/>
tive resources are assured by nature's own numinous being.</p>
<p>He knows that there is pathos in the yearning for unity and wholeness, as the moments in which one expe-<lb/>
riences a sense of divine totality are elusive and transitory. Yet <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> finds in our wonderment in the face of nature and in the contentment afforded by "spots of time"&#x2014;the renewal of self through stored recollections of sublimity&#x2014;the apparatus of faith. His poem <hi rend="italic">Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey</hi>, composed on <date when="1798-07-13">July 13, 1798</date>, while revisiting the "sylvan Wye" with its picturesque scenery and poetic ruins&#x2014;the scenery popu-<lb/>
larized by <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>&#x2014;is an embodiment of the faith whereby the human mind can achieve, not through reason, but by some innate and incomprehensible power
<q>
<lg>
<l>&#x2014;that serene and blessed mood</l>
<l>In which affections gently lead us on,</l>
<l>Until, the breath of this corporeal frame</l>
<l>And even the motion of our human blood</l>
<l>Almost suspended, we are laid asleep</l>
<l>In body and become a living soul,</l>
<l>While, with an eye made quiet by the power</l>
<l>Of harmony and the deep power of joy,</l>
<l>We see into the life of things &#x2026;<ref target="#CH7-n61"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">61</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p><name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> did not need temples, statues, or inscriptions to excite this mood. His poetry gives sanction to landscapes without any associations other than those of one's own recollected experiences of nature rapturously imbibed in youth:
<q>
<lg>
<l>The sounding cataract</l>
<l>Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,</l>
<l>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</l>
<l>Their colours and their forms, were then to me</l>
<l>An appetite: a feeling and a love,</l>
<l>That had no need of a remoter charm,</l>
<l>By thought supplied, or any interest</l>
<l>Unborrowed from the eye.<ref target="#CH7-n62"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">62</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>The same scenes of natural unadorned landscape can serve as a source of wisdom in maturity when
<q>
<lg>
<l>&#x2026; That time is past,</l>
<l>And all its aching joys are now no more,</l>
<l>And all its dizzy raptures. &#x2026;</l>
<l>&#x2026; For I have learned</l>
<l>To look on Nature not as in the hour</l>
<pb n="278"/>
<pb n="278" type="orig"/>
<l>Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</l>
<l>The still, sad music of humanity,</l>
<l>Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power</l>
<l>To chasten and subdue.<ref target="#CH7-n63"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">63</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>Nature is thus for <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> a powerful moral force, teacher, and guide. In <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s philosophy, the senses gave rise to ideas; in <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s Romantic vision, the transaction that occurs between the human mind and nature awakens a spiritual sense, and this engenders feelings of reverence and awe. In "The Ascent of Snowdon," with which he concludes <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>, <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> narrates an epiphany:
<q>
<lg>
<l>A meditation rose in me that night</l>
<l>Upon the lonely Mountain when the scene</l>
<l>Had passed away, and it appeared to me</l>
<l>The perfect image of a mighty Mind,</l>
<l>Of one that feeds upon infinity,</l>
<l>That is exalted by an underpresence,</l>
<l>The sense of God, or whatsoe'er is dim</l>
<l>Or vast in its own being. &#x2026;<ref target="#CH7-n64"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">64</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>With this spiritual legacy, it is understandable that Romanticism became a dominant cultural force in the nineteenth century. The paintings of Turner, the music of Wagner, the criticism of Ruskin, the acting of Ber-<lb/>
nhardt&#x2014;all attest to the vigorous long life of Roman-<lb/>
ticism, a movement whose echoes still resonate in our own day.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s work is pivotal. His is a revolu-<lb/>
tionary voice championing common humanity. He sings the heroes heretofore unsung; common folk, not legendary heroes, populate his poems. "The Old Cum-<lb/>
berland Beggar," "The Idle Shepherd Boys," "The Sailor's Mother," and "The Tinker" exist amid the picturesqueness of "The Ruined Cottage," "Hart-<lb/>
Leap Well," and "The Waterfall and the Eglantine." For <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>, beauty lies not in a some remote Golden Age, but is "a living Presence of the earth." In "Home at Grasmere" ("The Recluse") he queries:
<q>
<lg>
<l>&#x2026; Paradise, and groves</l>
<l>Elysian, fortunate islands, fields like those of old</l>
<l>In the deep ocean, wherefore should they be</l>
<l>A History, or but a dream, when minds</l>
<l>Once wedded to this outward frame of things,</l>
<l>In love, find these the growth of common day?<ref target="#CH7-n65"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">65</hi></hi></ref></l>
</lg>
</q></p>
<p>For him, the union of mind and universe is a boundless one; it implies individuation and seeks the sublime in the quotidian. Court and city were corrupt institutions in <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s opinion, the breeding grounds of inequality and misery. It is in the haunts of nature that the mind can itself become a kind of para-<lb/>
dise, the place where idealized moral beings like <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s citizen of Geneva or <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s yeoman farmer can experience joy and know self-worth. Soli-<lb/>
tude was for him a condition to be prized, a necessary means of developing the spiritual within oneself.</p>

esque controversy that had recently raged between <name type="pname">Knight</name>, <name type="pname">Price</name>, and <name type="pname">Repton</name>, he held definite views regarding landscape design, as was evident at Dove Cottage and Rhydal Mount, his Lake District villa near Grasmere, where his own gardens displayed his fine color sense and knowledge of botany (fig. 7.50). Rustic summerhouses, rock walls encrusted with moss and covered with vines, and steps with flowers squeez-<lb/>
ing through the paving stones were to be found in both. In <date when="1806">1806</date>, at the request of his friends, <name type="pname">Sir George and Lady Beaumont</name>, he sketched a plan that would convert an abandoned quarry at their country seat, Coleorton Hall, Leicestershire, into a one-acre winter
<pb n="279"/>
<pb n="279" type="orig"/>
garden planted with evergreen shrubs, cypresses, and firs. A pool at the quarry's edge reflected its craggy side walls and the tall spires of the conifers. A single basin for goldfish set in a lawn spangled with a few wildflowers completed <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s design of this intimate and secluded retreat where one could experi-<lb/>
ence the joys of solitude.</p>
<p>Glimpses of two ivy-clad cottages were allowed to intrude upon this Romantic scene, for <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> subscribed to the utilitarianism that would increas-<lb/>
ingly dominate nineteenth-century culture, believing that these signs of productive husbandry were compat-<lb/>
ible with the poetic mood of his landscape composi-<lb/>
tion. He felt that the landscape designer should respect the "sentiment of the place," the term he substituted for Pope's "Genius of the Place." Just as he banished the old classical deities of aristocratic humanism from his poetry, so, too, he wanted in the designed land-<lb/>
scape no allusions other than those inherent in natural and rural scenery. He wished to raise aesthetics above the dictates of taste to the realm where the mind, informed by culture, could engage actively and imag-<lb/>
inatively with landscape in all its aspects, including the vernacular.</p>
<p>The revolutionary era that informed <name type="pname">Words-<lb/>
worth</name>'s intellect and to which he gave voice had important consequences for landscape design. Hence-<lb/>
forth, <name type="pname">Bacchus</name> and <name type="pname">Pan</name> would absent themselves from the garden. With them, too, would disappear an international vocabulary of landscape ornament as cosmopolitan culture gave way to the ideals of Romantic nationalism. Thus, in an extension of the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> concept, folk heroes and other emblems of a political and secular order would take the place of antique divinities.</p>
<p>In the dawning Industrial Age, many people left the villages that were at last being considered pictur-<lb/>
esque adornments to the country seat, aggregating in cities larger than any built before. It would henceforth be the task of democratic humanitarianism to amelio-<lb/>
rate the conditions of urban life through the institution of the public park, the Romantic landscape of the com-<lb/>
mon man. But before examining the further manifesta-<lb/>
tions of Romanticism in nineteenth-century landscape design and the corresponding continuation and modi-<lb/>
fication of the picturesque as a viable style for private pleasure grounds and public parks alike, it is necessary to look at two other approaches to the spiritual in nature, those of <name type="place">China</name> and <name type="place">Japan</name>. As we have seen, the taste for Rococo <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi> in the eighteenth century brought but a facile interpretation of Chinese garden style into Western currency. We must therefore ask the question: What is the nature of Chinese and Japanese landscape design?</p>

</figure>
<p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>he notion of landscape as a text with encoded meaning, a place of memory and association, an experiential space in which to stroll and enjoy the unfolding of sequential views or to sit quietly and ponder the thoughts prompted by the impressions of scenery upon the senses&#x2014;these fundamentals were common to both East Asian gardens and the gardens developed in <name type="place">England</name> in the eighteenth century. The reciprocal association between landscape design and painting that was first developed in <name type="place">China</name> and then later adopted in <name type="place">Japan</name> is similar to the eighteenth-century English sensibility that found in <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name>'s seventeenth-century paintings an appro-<lb/>
priate idiom for the layout of the parks of great estates. Similarly, an affinity for landscape themes, prevalent in eighteenth- and nine-<lb/>
teenth-century English literature, is especially common in the poetry of <name type="place">China</name> and <name type="place">Japan</name>. The Romantic appreciation for the sub-<lb/>
lime in nature, which caused <name type="pname">William Wordsworth</name> to attune his soul to "the sounding cataract &#x2026; the tall rock, the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood," was akin to the reverence for nature of Chinese scholars and mystics many centuries before.</p>
<p>But in spite of this apparent similarity between East and West, at a certain point in time with regard to each culture's philosophical attitude toward landscape, the underlying differences between the historic gardens of Asia and those formed in <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place">America</name> are fundamental and profound. Western environmentalists attempt-<lb/>
ing to reforge the broken human contract with nature, who try to reason the causes for its rupture in the first place, must reckon with the Judeo-Christian tradition of a jealous God who tolerates no rivals and is situated in a remote Heaven, the true paradise as com-<lb/>
pared to the "false" paradise of this world. The ancient Greeks, who had dreamed their gods out of the ground and placed them in the sky upon Olympus, did not so thoroughly depopulate the earth of its divinities as did the monotheistic cultures of Judaism and Chris-<lb/>
tianity. They journeyed to sacred places in nature, seeking oracular wisdom at Delphi and spiritual initiation at Eleusis. But it is to nature-oriented religions like Daoism and <name type="pname">Shinto</name> that one must look to find a more direct bond between people and Earth. In <name type="place">China</name> and <name type="place">Japan</name>, although nature was as thoroughly harnessed to serve human economic ends as in the West, the scholarly and ruling elites espoused and expressed through landscape design Buddhist pre-<lb/>
cepts informed by <name type="pname">Daoist</name> and <name type="pname">Shinto</name> ideals emphasizing life lived in spiritual harmony with nature.<ref target="#CH8-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> <name type="pname">Chinese Daoist</name> thought fostered perceptions of <hi rend="italic">qi</hi>, the "breath," or inherent energy, possessed by all phenomena. In <name type="place">Japan</name>, <name type="pname">Shinto</name> religion led participants to reverence <hi rend="italic">kami</hi>, the spirits found in nature.<ref target="#CH8-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> Garden design in both countries reflected and nourished these ideals.</p>
<p>Rocks&#x2014;the mineral substance of nature&#x2014;had as strong an aesthetic and associative value in East Asian gardens as represen-<lb/>
tational sculpture in carved stone and cast bronze did in Western ones. In <name type="place">China</name>, garden designers employed carefully selected, water-worn rocks with clefts and fissures. These spatially intricate rocks were usually intended to evoke the mist-shrouded mountain ranges of the larger landscape, for the Chinese attributed to their country's peaks the same in-dwelling mystery and connection with the divine as did other early civilizations. Such scenery might be termed <hi rend="italic">sublime</hi> according to the aesthetics of the West.</p>
<p>In <name type="place">Japan</name>, where mountains are less dramatically formed, designers sometimes employed rocks in compositions that inten-<lb/>
tionally evoked scenes from Chinese painting, but more often rocks were placed in water or gravel "streams" as metaphorical islands. Japanese garden designers also displayed particular ingenuity in their selection of beautifully shaped flat stepping stones, position-<lb/>
ing them so as to form, in conjunction with moss, ground-plane patterns of highly pleasing pattern and texture. Like the rocks in Chinese gardens and their somewhat smaller counterparts dis-<lb/>
played in the studies of Chinese scholars, Japanese garden rocks were often associated with mythical or real animals of symbolical import. In both cultures, the viewer was encouraged to enjoy the abstract beauty of these mineral forms while also imagining their resemblance to other things.</p>

<p>As in other parts of the ancient world, the practice of landscape design in <name type="place">China</name> originated within a cultural matrix of mythology and imperial authority. In 219 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi-<lb/>
huangdi (ruled 221&#x2013;206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>), sent an expedition of young men and women to the eastern edge of the known world, where the immortals, known as <hi rend="italic">xian</hi>, were believed to dwell on enchanted islands upheld by giant tortoises.<ref target="#CH8-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref> The emperor charged their leader with the impossible task of discovering the sacred substance that prolonged the lives of the <hi rend="italic">xian</hi>. Although the expedition failed in its purpose, the notion of a paradisiacal quartet of islands&#x2014;<name type="pname">Penglai</name>, <name type="pname">Yingzhou</name>, <name type="pname">Fangzhang</name>, and <name type="pname">Huliang</name>&#x2014;remained embedded in Chinese mythology. The association of mountains and rocks that mimic mountains with immortality furnished the paradisiacal theme that runs throughout Chinese garden history, and the faraway <hi rend="italic">xian</hi>-inhabited islands were sometimes explicitly evoked in garden design as well as in poetry, painting, and the decorative arts.<ref target="#CH8-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p>

</figure>
<p>The Han emperor <name type="pname">Wudi</name> (<name type="pname">Liu Che</name>, ruled 140&#x2013;87 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>) built a lake garden in which rock constructions simulating the four island peaks of the immortals rose from the water, and later emperors, notably <name type="pname">Song Huizong</name> and <name type="pname">Khubilai Khan</name>, built imitations of these <hi rend="italic">xian</hi>-inhabited islands in their gardens. But even without the allusion to immortality, the premise that nature's own forms serve as a primary source of inspiration is a central principle of Chinese garden aesthetics. The combination of mountains (<hi rend="italic">shan</hi>) and water (<hi rend="italic">shui</hi>) (together meaning "landscape") fur-<lb/>
nished generations of garden builders with imagery for their compositions. These attempted to assemble in three dimensions the scenes found in Chinese land-<lb/>
scape painting.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese practiced agriculture and horticulture in sophisticated ways within the larger agrarian landscape, designed gardens (as opposed to vernacular gardens) were the exclusive preserves of an aristocratic elite. Like almost all designed gardens until relatively recent times, they were created by rul-<lb/>
ers and nobles. Many members of the Chinese nobil-<lb/>
ity were mandarins, high officials within the nine ranks of the imperial bureaucracy. A rigorous exam-<lb/>
ination system admitted young men into this govern-<lb/>
ment service, and although the sons of the nobility had certain obvious advantages of birth and education, diligent commoners whose families could finance the rote education in Confucian classics necessary to pass the examination could attain mandarin status. Schol-<lb/>
arship was therefore highly prized among those Chi-<lb/>
nese families who sought or wished to maintain social standing through connection with the court. Further-<lb/>
more, scholarship was closely allied with connois-<lb/>
seurship and practice of the arts.</p>
<p>The Chinese scholar was adept at calligraphy, painting, or poetry, and often all three. These were the expected accomplishments of the usually well-born and always well-educated class that governed <name type="place">China</name>. Thus, power&#x2014;which always implied both imperial favor and personal merit based on scholarship&#x2014;and aesthetics went hand in hand. Even when favor was withdrawn because of political circumstances, the Chinese gentleman scholar was not without financial or intellectual resources, and with the increased lei-<lb/>
sure brought about by retirement from government service he would often turn to the enterprise of garden
<pb n="283"/>
<pb n="283" type="orig"/>
building. Understandably therefore, garden-making in <name type="place">China</name> was closely allied with the other arts prac-<lb/>
ticed by the Chinese scholar. The mountainous land-<lb/>
scapes of painting, the riverine scenery described in poems, and inscriptions whereby calligraphy glossed the meaning of both natural and constructed land-<lb/>
scapes&#x2014;these three already intimately intercon-<lb/>
nected arts furnished both the imaginative resources and instruments of Chinese garden design (fig. 8.1). However, before the intricate artifice of the mature Chinese garden, with its compression of seas into island-studded lakes and mountains into hillocks of fantastically shaped rocks was achieved in the South-<lb/>
ern Song (<date when="1127">1127</date>&#x2013;<date when="1279">1279</date>) and later periods, there was already a venerable history of garden-making. Not surprisingly, as in Persia, where the first known gar-<lb/>
den "paradise" was a royal hunting park, the Chinese garden had similar origins, as an imperial game res-<lb/>
ervation.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Qin and Han Landscapes</hi></hi></head>
<p>With the subjugation of all rival states in 221 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, emperor <name type="pname">Qin Shihuangdi</name> established his capital city of Chang'an (modern <name type="pname">Xi</name>'an) on the banks of the Wei River. Here he built his lofty and magnificent palace and a vast hunting preserve known as Shanglin Park.<ref target="#CH8-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref> Shanglin Park was encircled with stout walls, just as the empire itself was protected with stupen-<lb/>
dous fortifications. More than an imperial pleasure ground, this huge park, with its collected botanical and zoological riches, was perceived as a symbol of the empire's worldly supremacy and cosmic gran-<lb/>
deur. Even when the empire of <name type="pname">Qin Shihuangdi</name> was overthrown, <name type="pname">Shanglin Park</name> was not destroyed, and the court poets of his Han successors extolled its size and magnificence as well as the abundance of its wildlife, no doubt seeing in its preservation a state-<lb/>
ment of their own masters' far-flung imperial power.</p>
<p>The relationship between gardens and the nat-<lb/>
ural scenery of mountains and water was given fur-<lb/>
ther impetus when in 311 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> barbarian invaders breached the Great Wall, and the convulsions of political power that followed gave <name type="place">China</name> a second imperial center south of the <name type="pname">Chang Jiang</name> (Yangzi River) near present-day Nanjing. Here were found precipitous, mist-enshrouded mountains, smooth lakes, and meandering rivers. With the North under foreign control, the governing elite composed of highly educated imperial civil servants built country estates in the lush countryside outside their reestab-<lb/>
lished capital. This relocation in the scenic South fostered receptivity to Daoism, the nature-mysticism espoused by the legendary Laozi (b. 604 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>). As the old Confucian order continued to disintegrate, nature appreciation offered sensitive imperial bureaucrats an escape from the harsh political reali-<lb/>
ties of the times.</p>
<p>With the growth of Buddhism, which had been introduced via the Silk Route sometime between 50 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> and 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>, the Chinese gained a religion in which quiet meditation was a means toward spiritual awareness. Contemplative religious practice rein-<lb/>
forced a Chinese proclivity for wilderness retreat, and many scholar poets and landscape artists joined Buddhist monks in seeking spiritual fulfillment in nature. In the extraordinarily beautiful <name type="pname">Lushan Range</name> appeared the soaring rooftops of the famous monas-<lb/>
tery founded by the Buddhist monk <name type="pname">Huiyuan</name> (c. 334&#x2013;416 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>), and here and there other Buddhist temples accented the lofty scenery. This scenery, which became virtually paradigmatic in Chinese landscape painting, expresses the ideal of complete human integration with nature. It is an ideal nour-<lb/>
ished not only by Buddhist thought but also by Dao-<lb/>
ism and the <name type="pname">Daoist</name> concept of transcendental <hi rend="italic">qi</hi>, the "breath" that animates all things, giving them their own inherent nature. Through syncretism Daoism became fused to some extent with the teachings of Buddhism and Confucianism, and the <name type="pname">Daoist</name> notion of a spiritual energy composed of the complementary yin and yang forces that pervade the universe became commonplace in Chinese thought. The grandeur of towering peaks and the misty vastness of successive ranges, with tiny figures defining the scale of human activity within their majestic presence, evoke the <name type="pname">Daoist</name> belief in the eternal unity of all things in nature. It is this illusion of total immersion in the infinitude of nature that distinguishes Chinese art from the more obviously homocentric, individualis-<lb/>
tic, and spatially explicit art of the West.</p>
<p>Paintings and poetic descriptions of the natu-<lb/>
rally scenic Lushan landscape furnished the ideal that underlies much subsequent Chinese garden design. <name type="pname">Huiyuan</name>'s followers, among whom were several painters and poets, carried the inspiration of mountain scenery of mossy paths, pine groves, steep cliffs, and precipitous waterfalls into the creation of their own Lushan "parks," private rustic retreats. These were not so much designed gardens as care-<lb/>
fully selected spots in nature that could be enhanced with such things as a bamboo grove, a thatched hut, a flowering plum or peach tree. The poets <name type="pname">Xie Lingyun</name> (385&#x2013;433 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) and <name type="pname">Tao Qian</name> (365&#x2013;427 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) found beauty in the marriage of the sublime with the humble, "borrowing" the nearby Lushan mountain scenery while taking pleasure in fields, orchards, willow trees, and the sounds of barnyard animals. The rustication of gentleman scholars and their assumption of a quasi-hermitic way of life, often after a period of service in the imperial bureau-<lb/>
<pb n="284"/>
<pb n="284" type="orig"/>
cracy, became a fairly common phenomenon by the beginning of the Tang dynasty (618&#x2013;907 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>). Their economic and social standing permitted them to retire from worldly affairs when the situation at court or per-<lb/>
sonal preference made this desirable.</p>
<p>In the Tang era <name type="place">China</name>'s population reached 160 million. Ancient forests were felled as new lands were put into rice production. A vast system of canals con-<lb/>
nected the populous Yangzi River valley with the cit-<lb/>
ies of the Yellow River plain to the north and Hangzhou to the south. In addition, a system of roads converged like the spokes of a wheel upon the Tang capital at Chang'an, a teeming cosmopolitan trading center at the end of the Silk Road in the western prov-<lb/>
ince of Shaanxi. It was a period of commercial and urban growth, massive irrigation systems, and other public works projects. Although a powerful aristoc-<lb/>
racy governed the country, its systematic education in preparation for government service ensured homoge-<lb/>
neous cultural values within a unified ideological framework and created an ingrained conservative political orientation.</p>
<p>The imperial administrative apparatus helped sustain Chinese civilization through periods of inva-<lb/>
sion and internal upheaval for the next thousand years. Those who became civil servants received extensive privileges and perquisites. They were not, however, allowed to serve in their home provinces nor to own land in those to which they were sent. Some were assigned to the court, where eunuchs and favorite con-<lb/>
cubines contributed to an atmosphere of political intrigue. In court, a scholar-administrator could easily fall into disfavor, or he could find himself on the wrong side of changing imperial policy and thus expe-<lb/>
rience disgrace. Serving in a province remote from his homeland, he would often long to return to his family, friends, and property. Beset by these complexities, the scholar-administrators who constituted <name type="place">China</name>'s literate and affluent mandarin class, found escape from doc-<lb/>
trinaire administration and factional politics in a life of refined retirement, pursuing <name type="pname">Daoist</name> philosophy and Buddhist study. Able to indulge in wilderness travel, urban culture, and rural ease, they became <name type="place">China</name>'s great calligraphers, poets, painters, musicians, and gar-<lb/>
den makers.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">Wang Wei</name></hi></hi></head>
<p>In the front rank among Tang officials who were accomplished practitioners of the arts was <name type="pname">Wang Wei</name> (699&#x2013;759 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>). Having passed the civil service exam-<lb/>
ination when he was twenty, he was appointed Assis-<lb/>
tant Secretary for Music at the court in Chang'an because of his musical abilities. Probably for some minor offense he was transferred to an insignificant provincial post where he served for several years before returning to the capital. He bought an estate 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) outside of Chang'an on the Wang River and in his retirement from public service flourished as an artist, combining his talents as callig-<lb/>
rapher, painter, and poet.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Wang Wei</name> was a devout lay Buddhist, and his poetry and, no doubt, his paintings&#x2014;which survive only as copies&#x2014;demonstrate his sensory appreciation of such things as the tender green of willow trees by a stream, the moon's silver disk mirrored in water or shedding its white light on night-stilled nature, the blush of peach blossoms in springtime, the fragrance and gnarled beauty of pine trees, the pliancy of bam-<lb/>
boo stirring in the breeze, the oriole's chirp, the peaks of distant mountains wreathed in mist, and tiny boat-<lb/>
men glimpsed from afar. His "broken ink" technique and special brushstroke for expressively rendering the rocky faces of old eroded mountains enriched the painter's vocabulary and probably promoted the appreciation of weathered rocks themselves, a signif-<lb/>
icant fact for the subsequent development of the Chi-<lb/>
nese garden. <name type="pname">Wang Wei</name>'s most famous painting was that of <name type="pname">Wangchuan</name> Villa, his riverside estate, a scroll containing twenty scenes depicting several pavilions along a rocky riverbank and the views from them. The scroll, which no longer exists, was copied by later painters, and garden builders evoked its subject in their creations.</p>
<p>While solitary meditation beside a stream or in the mountains could deepen the spirit, scenes of nature were often enjoyed in company, and for <name type="place">China</name>'s liter-<lb/>
ary and artistic intelligentsia, the garden became a favored locale for cherishing friendship and remem-<lb/>
bering particular friends. Wine was both a solace for worldly disappointment and a means of attaining a sense of oneness with the spirit of nature. In their gar-<lb/>
dens, many scholar-poets eluded the pain of living and achieved a state of ecstasy under the influence of alco-<lb/>
hol, a condition that they often celebrated in literature.</p>
<p>Nor was drinking merely a solitary and escapist pleasure. The association of wine drinking, friendship, and nature appreciation through poetry in fact goes back at least to 353 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> when <name type="pname">Wang Xizhi</name> composed a famous calligraphy scroll celebrating a springtime gathering of poets at the Orchid Pavilion near pres-<lb/>
ent-day Shaoxing in the province of Zhejiang. Upon that and many similar occasions over the centuries cups of wine would be sent downstream by servants as each literary gentleman raced to compose verses, or cap another poet's lines, before his cup arrived at the spot where he sat upon the banks writing. By the Tang era, the literary drinking party was an established form of entertainment in Chinese gardens, and pavilions were built with meandering stream courses incised into their floor paving to accommodate this garden
<pb n="285"/>
<pb n="285" type="orig"/>
game (fig. 8.2).</p>
<p>Several other scholar-officials besides <name type="pname">Wang Wei</name> fused their literary and artistic talents, becoming noted calligraphers and painters as well as poets. For the Chi-<lb/>
nese gentleman-scholar-poet-artist, calligraphy and painting were often one, sharing not only the common use of a brush, but also the same fundamental commit-<lb/>
ment to the expression of <hi rend="italic">qi</hi>. One aspect of Chinese painting is to be possessed of <hi rend="italic">qi</hi> in order to constitute a graphic expression of this invisible energy source. In a similar fashion, the Chinese garden designer selected rocks whose forms and surfaces were animated by <hi rend="italic">qi</hi> so that they became presences that were alive to eye, hand, and mind that viewed, touched, and contemplated them. Evocative of the mountains depicted in Chinese land-<lb/>
scape painting and their association with immortality, these rocks furnished the garden with its paradisiacal iconography.</p>

The Song emperor Huizong (ruled <date when="1100">1100</date>&#x2013;<date when="1125">1125</date> <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>), an accomplished painter, also patronized and thereby pro-<lb/>
moted a more intimate style of painting depicting jew-<lb/>
el-like renderings of birds, blossoming fruit trees, and individual flower forms. From the contents of these paintings and from information about constructed land-<lb/>
scapes of the period, we know that artists found inspira-<lb/>
tion in gardens, and the subject matter of their paintings in turn suggested forms and motifs for the creators of gardens.</p>
<p>Song Huizong was as interested in his imperial gar-<lb/>
dens as he was in painting. Assisted by practitioners of <hi rend="italic">feng shui</hi> ("wind" and "water"), professional geo-<lb/>
mancers (diviners of favorable sites and alignments who procured for human constructions the most beneficial influences of the local landscape's spiritual forces), he established his pleasure park of Genyue in the north-<lb/>
western quarter of Kaifeng. There he collected a large number of fantastical rocks&#x2014;water-sculpted stones&#x2014;and many choice botanical specimens. By creating an artificial mountain called Wanshou Shan (Mountain of Numberless Years), Song Huizong followed the recom-<lb/>

mass as a means of blocking evil forces and concentrating good ones.</p>

<p>With the invasion that unseated Song Huizong, for-<lb/>
eign rule was established over <name type="place">China</name>'s northern prov-<lb/>
inces. Its lords, the Jin dynasty, chose <name type="place">Beijing</name> for their capital. In <date when="1138">1138</date>, after twelve years during which the Song court and the many ethnic Chinese attached to it lived in a series of temporary capitals, they relo-<lb/>
cated to Hangzhou in the south. There a brilliant epoch of artistic and literary accomplishment ensued. The beautiful lakes and hills around Hangzhou became an inspiration to painters and provided a more picturesque setting for palaces and gardens than the plains of Kaifeng.</p>
<p>In the century and a half that constitutes the Southern Song period (<date when="1127">1127</date>&#x2013;<date when="1279">1279</date>), the time of the Song court's transfer to Hangzhou, technical innova-<lb/>
tions, a money economy, and the expansion in agri-<lb/>
cultural productivity brought the country to a level of prosperity well in advance of the rest of the world at that time. Commerce and trade stimulated the growth of cities. Movable type, which the Chinese had invented in the eleventh century, encouraged a book publishing industry and stimulated literacy. The arts flourished, and many wealthy landowners built gar-<lb/>
dens. The tourist visiting West Lake today can see "fairy-tale" scenery picturesquely accented by water-<lb/>
side pavilions, which are part of famous views with names like those of poems or paintings: "Listening to Orioles Singing in the Waving Willows," "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake," "Lotus Flowers Swaying in Quyuan Garden" and "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon." Today's versions of these pavilions and their surrounding scenery preserve only faint echoes of the intricately constructed poetic landscapes built there in Song times (fig. 8.4).</p>
<p>Many private residences in Hangzhou had fine gardens, and <name type="place">Suzhou</name>, a center of the silk industry and also an important cultural center, was the site of many more. In addition to numerous small, beautifully crafted urban gardens, aristocratic garden estates were built in the hills on the outskirts of the city. <name type="place">Suzhou</name>'s fame as a garden mecca was further enhanced by its location near Lake Tai, source of the water-modeled garden stones that are as highly prized in Chinese gardens as important works of sculpture might be in Western ones. The West Dongting Hill furnished an especially fine multicolored stone full of creases and cavities, and the Lingyan Hill yielded yellowish rocks, the hard, veined surfaces of which are streaked with white, red, and purple.</p>
<p>The Song official who had literary and artistic gifts liked to build a garden that reminded him and his visitors of the wild scenery sought by mountain recluses. Like the monochromatic landscape paint-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name>'s Garden Manual: The <hi rend="italic">Yuan Ye</hi></hi></hi></head>
<p>By the end of the Song period, the conventions of Chi-<lb/>
nese garden design were well established. As Chinese merchants prospered during the Ming dynasty, they, like the emperor himself, emulated the cultural elite, the mandarin class of scholar-officials. To help these arriv-<lb/>
istes avoid the aesthetic blunders of the uneducated, garden designers began to write treatises that codified garden style and served as manuals for landscape build-<lb/>
ers.</p>
<p>Foremost among these was the <hi rend="italic">Yuan ye</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">The Craft of Gardens</hi>, by <name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name>. <date when="1582">1582</date>) of Wujiang in the province of <name type="pname">Jiangsu</name>.<ref target="#CH8-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref> A noted garden builder him-<lb/>
self, as well as a poet and painter, he completed his comprehensive three-volume classic on landscape the-<lb/>
ory and practice in <date when="1634">1634</date>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name>'s book is unusual, and perhaps unique, among garden manuals in its blend of practical advice and pattern-book instruction with poetic visualization and mood painting. Although specific in discussing the appearance of various kinds of stones and offering abundant diagrams for window and railing lattices, together with numerous door shapes and paving designs, the <hi rend="italic">Yuan ye</hi> offers no static prescription for garden planning. The author firmly states that "there is no definite way of making scenery; you know it is right when it stirs your emotions," stressing that it is <hi rend="italic">qi</hi>, the pulsating breath of life that must be the result of the designer's efforts.</p>
<p>Good siting is a primary ingredient of <name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name>'s prescription for garden making. A garden designer must screen out what is ugly and offensive and make use of "borrowed scenery" (<hi rend="italic">jie jing</hi>), whether a distant view of misty mountains, the rooflines of a nearby monastery, or the flowers of a neighbor's garden. A small piece of ground beside a dwelling can be turned into a garden by digging a pond, collecting stones with which to build up a "mountain," and making a welcoming gate for guests. Willows, a stand of bamboos, and some luxuri-<lb/>
ant trees and flowers are all that are needed to complete the picture and set the mood for poetry-writing parties and sitting in the company of one's favorite concubine melting snow water for tea.</p>
<p>In <name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name>'s manual, in the chapter "The Selec-<lb/>
tion of Stones," he discusses in reverent detail the highly prized Lake Tai stones with their hollows and holes. He recommends that these be given pride of place like fine sculpture in front of big halls, within large pavilions, or beneath a stately pine tree. It is clear from the <hi rend="italic">Yuan ye</hi> that stone selection was a highly developed skill limited to a small number of individuals who could successfully quarry fine specimens from the mountains or find them in river and lake beds. Some-<lb/>
times to be found in museum collections of Chinese art today these prize stones, with light and shade directing the eye as it travels in and out of their folds and hollows and up the flanks of an imagined mountain precipice, do appear to possess <hi rend="italic">qi;</hi> their vibrancy is akin to that found in works of painting and calligraphy in the same galleries.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name> also writes about wall design. The walls in Chinese gardens provide an important means of seg-<lb/>
regating space, screening from sight the mundane workaday reality of city streets while making the gar-<lb/>
den invisible to passersby, except for glimpses gained through latticed openings composed of thin tiles or cast bricks. The walls of Chinese gardens often rise and fall according to the elevation of the ground. Curved roof tiles, sometimes following a wavy line, produce a sense of animated movement, while bas-relief friezes fre-<lb/>
quently add ornamental interest.</p>

</figure>
<p>Walls outline various courts and corridors within the garden, subdividing it into discrete though linked scenic units. These are often pierced by windows with tracery, for which <name type="pname">Ji Cheng</name> provided many patterns (figs. 8.5, 8.6). Carefully placed windows and circular "moon gates" and vase- or gourd-shaped doors frame views of adjacent garden spaces (fig. 8.7). The white-<lb/>
washed surfaces of these walls are often brush-rubbed with ground yellow river sand mixed with a small amount of chalk to give them a lustrous waxy polish.</p>

<p>The function of a Chinese garden wall is not, how-<lb/>
ever, ornamental; rather, it is meant to serve, like the neutral silk or paper of a painting, as a back-<lb/>
ground, capturing shadows in calligraphic patterns and acting as a foil for the rocks and plants in front of it.</p>

The principal hall faces a central pond, which occupies approximately three-tenths of the site (see fig. 8.9). Like the arms of a lake in nature, the ends of the pond are made to disappear from sight, in winding coves, behind bridges, or beyond covered walkways. Buildings, rocks, water, paths, and plants are parts of a harmonious whole, the intent of which is to frame compositions of scenery and furnish various vantage points from which to enjoy a sequence of views. These views are intended to remind one of the kind of journey in nature that one experiences when looking at a Chinese landscape painting, mentally climbing up tortuous mountain paths or following the indented shoreline of a lake.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Landscapes of Literature: The Story of the Stone</hi></hi></head>
<p>Much of the story in the great eighteenth-century novel by <name type="pname">Cao Xueqin</name> (c. <date when="1724">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764">1764</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Story of the Stone</hi>, also known as <hi rend="italic">The Dream of the Red Chamber</hi>, takes place within the Jia family's aris-<lb/>
tocratic compound, which includes a scholar-gar-<lb/>
den called the Grand View Garden.<ref target="#CH8-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> Almost an entire chapter is devoted to a detailed description of the annexation of additional family property to expand it into a new garden wherein the family can receive visits from a daughter who has just been elevated to the position of Imperial Concubine. We are told that "the digging of pools, the raising of hills, the siting and erection of lodges and pavil-<lb/>
ions, the planting of bamboos and flowers&#x2014;in a word, all matters pertaining to the landscaping and layout of the gardens, were planned and supervised by Horticultural Hu," an eminent landscape gar-<lb/>
dener.</p>
<p>We are then invited on a tour of the new gar-<lb/>
den as it is nearing completion. The reader-visitor enters through "a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles," admiring the beautifully patterned latticework of the wooden doors, simple whitewashed walls, and fine, unos-<lb/>
tentatious craftsmanship. Directly the tourist of this imaginary landscape encounters a miniature moun-<lb/>
tain formed of "large white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes, rising course upon course up one of its sides, some recumbent, some upright or leaning at angles, their surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half-concealed by creepers, and with a narrow zig-<lb/>
zag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between them." A tunnel through a shoulder of this rock deposits the supposed wanderer in a lush artificial ravine. Below, through the trees, a clear rushing stream broadens into a wide pool edged by a marble baluster and spanned by a beautiful tri-<lb/>
ple-arched marble bridge. Brightly painted, fanci-<lb/>
fully decorated, luxuriously furnished pavilions ascend the slopes of the ravine. Another pavilion is poised over the center of the bridge.</p>
<p>On the far side of the pool, a path threads its way between rocks and flowers and trees before suddenly coming upon whitewashed walls enclos-<lb/>
ing a dense thicket of bamboo. In the middle of this bamboo grove stands a small scholarly retreat. At the rear, this structure opens onto "a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flow-<lb/>
ering pear tree." A stream gushes through an open-<lb/>
ing in the back wall into a narrow channel, which runs around one side of the house and then mean-<lb/>
ders through the bamboos before disappearing through another opening in the wall.</p>
<p>A climb around the base of a steeply sloping hill brings into view a mud-walled compound tucked into a fold halfway up the hillside. It con-<lb/>
tains an apricot orchard and a cluster of rustic cot-<lb/>
tages with thatched roofs. An irregularly shaped hedge formed by loosely interweaving the young shoots of mulberry, elm, hibiscus, and silkworm
<pb n="289"/>
<pb n="289" type="orig"/>
thorn trees stands outside the orchard wall, and below it a rustic well overlooks miniature fields of vegeta-<lb/>
bles and flowers, the equivalent of a Western kitchen garden. The reader's tour through it engenders a lively discussion on the distinction between utilitarian land-<lb/>
scapes such as this, which have obviously been planted by the human hand, and ones that presume to imitate nature with little appearance of artifice.</p>
<p>To manifest the difference, beyond the rustic vil-<lb/>
lage, the author takes us to a spot where we can hear the musical sound of water issuing from a vine-fringed cave in the rock. The "mountainous" topography of the garden is again evident as we scramble over this grotto, up a steep path, and then back down to the banks of the winding stream fringed with willows interspersed with "peach and apricot trees whose interlacing branches made little worlds of stillness and serenity beneath them. Blossoms float on the surface of the water."</p>
<p>The scarlet balustrade of a wooden bridge glimpsed through the screen of pendant willow branches beckons us to cross, whereupon we discover diverging paths leading to other parts of the garden. Ahead, an elegant pavilion stands in a courtyard con-<lb/>
taining a remarkable rock, with light and shade play-<lb/>
ing over its delicate surface of fissures and hollows. This miniature mountain&#x2014;a collector's specimen&#x2014;is surrounded by smaller rocks, but the courtyard is otherwise bare except for some vines and flowering plants of exquisite fragrance. Beyond this summer-<lb/>
house stands the magnificent residence hall, from which "gold-glinting cat-faces, rainbow-hued ser-<lb/>
pents' snouts peered out or snarled down from cornice and finial."</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, aristocratic families preserved the landscape design traditions formulated centuries before in the Song period. The new garden described by <name type="pname">Cao Xueqin</name> is an exceptionally large one, covering one-quarter square mile (.65 square kilometers) of the Jia family estate. Typically, the scholar-garden in an urban locale compressed a great deal of scenery of a similarly associative nature into a much smaller frame, as we shall see below when we examine an actual garden, contemporary with that of the novel.</p>
<p>In <hi rend="italic">The Story of the Stone</hi>, the characters are examining the newly built garden for the purpose of naming its different parts, inasmuch as Chinese garden makers considered a garden without calligraphy denot-<lb/>
ing the names of various rock and plant groupings, water scenery, viewing pavilions, and scholarly retreats to be incomplete. Inscriptions are an important part of a Chinese garden, and the carving of names and descriptive verse onto rocks and stone plaques is a time-honored custom. In this case, provisional inscrip-<lb/>
tions were to be painted on rectangular paper lanterns, pending approval by <name type="pname">Yuanchun</name>, the young woman who had been promoted to the Imperial Bedchamber and for whom the garden was being readied in antici-<lb/>
pation of her occasional visits to her family.</p>
<p>The act of naming and the fusion of literary tra-<lb/>
dition with scenic appreciation are a venerable Chi-<lb/>
nese practice that goes beyond garden inscriptions to include actual scenes in nature. In <name type="place">China</name>, where the distinction between travel literature and the literature of landscape hardly exists, the descriptions of scenes along the traveler's route, like the scenes depicted on a landscape scroll, are more important than the per-<lb/>
sonal adventures of the protagonist or the final goal of his journey. Travel writing as a genre has ancient roots in <name type="place">China</name>, and poetical inscriptions recording the sen-<lb/>
sations and impressions of earlier visitors were carved into rocks (fig. 8.8). Inscriptions were not seen as defacing nature, but rather as enhancing it through literary commentary.</p>
<p>Many famous views have accretions of rock-<lb/>
carved inscriptions around them. A very early exam-<lb/>
ple is found in <hi rend="italic">The Chronicle of Mu</hi>, probably written sometime during the fifth to fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>, in which <name type="pname">Emperor Mu</name>, who reigned six hundred years earlier, is described as having recorded his journey into the Xi Mountains with a rock inscription, after having planted a tree and named the spot Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West.<ref target="#CH8-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>The <name type="pname">Wang Shi Yuan</name>, or the Garden of the Master of the Fishing Nets, is one of several remaining schol-<lb/>
ar-gardens in <name type="place">Suzhou</name> that give some impression of the lives led by the educated and bureaucratic elite in imperial <name type="place">China</name>. Much literary meaning is packed into this one-and-a-half-acre garden of idyllically arranged scenery, and the spaces within it bear the kinds of poetical names that <name type="pname">Jia Zheng</name>'s son <name type="pname">Baoyu</name> was summoned to provide in <hi rend="italic">The Story of the Stone</hi>. First laid out in <date when="1140">1140</date>, in early Southern Song times by a high court official, it was restored in <date when="1770">1770</date> by another official, <name type="pname">Song Zongyuan</name>, as his retirement retreat. Though altered both before and after its appropriation by the municipal government in <date when="1958">1958</date>, its outlines and principal features remain the same as in the Qing period (<date when="1644">1644</date>&#x2013;<date when="1911">1911</date>). Like other schol-<lb/>
ar-gardens, it is highly compartmentalized, with courtyards and roofed structures interlocking like pieces of a puzzle (fig. 8.9).</p>
<p>In former times, visitors arriving by palanquin would have entered the <name type="pname">Wang Shi Yuan</name> through the main entrance on the south where the residential quar-<lb/>
ters are. Today access is through a narrow passageway from a side alley into the northern end of the complex, which leads more directly into the garden. In either case, the route into the Place for Gathering Breezes&#x2014;the central garden space, dominated by a lake&#x2014;is a circuitous one. Its chief focal point, as seen from the Duck Shooting Corridor adjacent to the family halls, is the Pavilion of the Arriving Moon and Wind, a del-<lb/>
icate, six-sided structure with soaring rooflines col-<lb/>
lected in a high finial (fig. 8.10). Poised on its appropriately scaled rockery above the surface of the lake, it is a resting place where one can gaze dreamily at the reflections in the water. A mirror inside increases the sparkling play of light on its surfaces.</p>
<p>The visitor does not arrive by an obvious path to this spot but is diverted along the way by other pavilions and their adjacent courtyards. The Hall of Small Mountains and Osmanthus Spring is com-<lb/>
pletely screened from the lake by a tall mountain of
<pb n="291"/>
<pb n="291" type="orig"/>
earth and rockwork. From inside, one views this com-<lb/>
position through windows framed with lacy fretwork. On the south side of this structure lies a small court-<lb/>
yard containing many fine specimens of Lake Tai rocks placed in an undulating composition. The bright white wall of this courtyard constitutes the pictorial ground upon which the shadows of the fragrant osmanthus trees are cast, forming a tracery pattern that complements the fretwork of the small openings in it as well as that of the windows of the pavilion.</p>
<p>The Waterside Hall for Washing the Tassels of One's Hat sits at the water's edge on the south side of the lake opposite the Veranda for Viewing Pines and Looking at Paintings. The latter pavilion has a lake view seen through old pines and cypresses, which are set in a rockery. Besides these lakeside summerhouses, there are other garden pavilions, several of which serve the needs of the scholar. The Five Peaks Study, for instance, is a library. Since interior stairs are not favored in ornamental Chinese architecture, access to its second story was gained via steps set into a rockery next to its east wall. Adjacent to it is the House of Concentrated Study. Another study, the Cottage to Accompany Spring, had its own private pebble-paved courtyard garden to the south as well as another tiny courtyard on the north. The latter, which is framed from inside by beautifully carved window surrounds, contains a delicate composition of bamboo, rocks, and flowering plants.</p>

Like other disaffected Chinese civil servants before them, a number of the mandarin elite went into permanent retirement rather than serve the foreign conqueror, some finding careers as artists whose works were in demand by the growing mer-<lb/>

<p>The Jin emperors, whose occupancy of <name type="place">Beijing</name> preceded that of the Mongols, had excavated a canal and a marshy lake, the nucleus of the three contempo-<lb/>
rary lakes around which "sea palaces" and pleasure parks were built. <name type="pname">Khubilai Khan</name> further excavated this lake, which is known as Bei Hai, or Northern Sea, setting up hunting preserves around it and embellish-<lb/>

To <name type="pname">Marco Polo</name>, this Green Hill presented a wondrous sight.

<p>The first emperor of the Ming dynasty (<date when="1368">1368</date>&#x2013;<date when="1644">1644</date>) located the capital at Nanjing where it remained until the third emperor, <name type="pname">Yongle</name> (ruled <date when="1403">1403</date>&#x2013;<date when="1424">1424</date>), reestablished the court at <name type="place">Beijing</name>. For fourteen years <name type="pname">Yongle</name>'s builders labored to erect a city modeled on the previous Ming emperor's capital at Nanjing. Guided by geomancy, Confucian symbolism, and cos-<lb/>
mology, they gave physical representation to the emperor's rule under the "mandate of heaven." This was expressed as a hierarchical ordering of space in which were nested three rectangular walled enclo-<lb/>
sures containing the Inner City, the Imperial City, and the Forbidden City, all of which were centered on a great north-south axis punctuated by ceremonial gates (fig. 8.11).</p>

<p>In <date when="1420">1420</date>, <name type="pname">Yongle</name>'s vast complex of walled enclo-<lb/>
sures and palatial buildings was ready for occupancy, and <name type="place">Beijing</name> officially became the Ming capital. The Altar of Heaven was also built in the reign of <name type="pname">Yongle</name> to the south of <name type="pname">Qian Qing Men</name> (Gate of August Purity), the great Front Gate of the Inner City. It was flanked by two circular temples, the Temple of Heaven and the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. During the reign of <name type="pname">Jiajing</name> (ruled <date when="1522">1522</date>&#x2013;<date when="1566">1566</date>) in the next century at the cardinal points just outside the Inner City addi-<lb/>
tional magnificent altars were raised to the Earth, Sun, Moon, and Agriculture. At that time, about <date when="1550">1550</date>, another walled rectangle was constructed, enclosing the district to the south of the Inner City. Called the Outer City, it encompassed the Altar of Heaven and the Altar of Agriculture (replaced by a Worker's Sta-<lb/>
dium in the <date when="1950">1950</date>s).</p>
<p>Because of fires and other mishaps, the imperial buildings that one sees today are almost all reconstruc-<lb/>
tions of the Qing dynasty, but Chinese conservatism has nonetheless ensured continuity of form, making it possible at least to imagine the appearance of the ancient Ming capital of the fifteenth century. In spite of the degradation of much of its elegant imperial architectural heritage under Communist rule, <name type="place">Beijing</name> still offers an unrivaled ceremonial progression along a central axis that thrusts northward through a hierar-<lb/>
chical series of magnificent gates, symmetrically arranged courts, and majestic halls, passing first through the Outer City and then into the precincts of the Forbidden City (figs. 8.12, 8.13). Continuing through the <name type="pname">Shen Wu Men</name>&#x2014;the Gate of the Martial Spirit built to guard the Forbidden City from northern invaders&#x2014;and crossing a moat, the axis continues to <name type="pname">Jing Shan</name>, or Prospect Hill, also known as Mei Shan, Coal Hill.</p>
<p>Constructed in the fifteenth century with erosion material dredged from the moat that encircles the For-<lb/>
bidden City, Coal Hill is now a public park and the highest point in <name type="place">Beijing</name>. The siting of the Forbidden City in its lee, where it was sheltered from northerly winds and unfriendly spirits, is in accordance with the
<pb n="293"/>
<pb n="293" type="orig"/>
Chinese geomantic practice of <hi rend="italic">feng shui</hi>. In imperial times this eminence was planted with fruit trees and served as a bird sanctuary and place of retreat for the emperor and members of the court. During his long reign, the Qianlong emperor (ruled <date when="1736">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795">1795</date>) built upon each of its five low peaks an open-framed pavil-<lb/>
ion housing a bronze statue of a deity. With their var-<lb/>
iously shaped roofs, these acted as "borrowed" scenery for the gardens within the Forbidden City.</p>

<p>While vowing simplicity and professing the modest ideals of a scholar-poet, the Qianlong emperor who built the pavilions on Coal Hill proved to be a lavish creator of landscapes. His vast project, the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name>, or the Garden of Perfect Brightness, gave Euro-<lb/>
peans&#x2014;thanks to the publication of letters of the Jesuit missionary Father Attiret (<date when="1702">1702</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) in the middle of the eighteenth century&#x2014;their first real knowledge of the Chinese garden.</p>
<p>One of five imperial parks created in the north-<lb/>
western hills outside the city during the Qing dynasty, the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name> was given its basic form by the Yongzheng emperor, who reigned between <date when="1723">1723</date> and <date when="1735">1735</date>. His son, the Qianlong emperor, made a pledge to practice restraint in regard to imperial works, but he soon broke it, setting a force of a thousand men to work on the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name> (fig. 8.14). Lakes were dug, hillocks thrown up, fantastical rocks positioned in eye-catching arrangements, trees and flowers planted, and many pavilions, zigzag bridges, and other architectural features erected. The emperor then went on to embellish the <name type="pname">Chang Chun Yuan</name> (Garden of Everlasting Spring), which had been his grandfather's old retreat, in the same fashion. He also developed the Garden of Joyous Spring (<name type="pname">Ji Chun Yuan</name>), fusing it and the <name type="pname">Chang Chun Yuan</name> with the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name> as a complex of three separate but linked gardens.</p>
<p>By this time the Chinese scholar-gardens of southern <name type="place">China</name> had a long and prestigious history, and this northern imperial garden was conceived some-<lb/>
what as an eclectic "collection" of many famous southern garden scenes. For the pleasure of court ladies whose lives were narrowly circumscribed by palace garden walls, the emperor had a true-to-life shopping street created. On the northeast boundary of the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name> he commissioned Father Attiret's fellow Jesuit missionary Father Giuseppe Castiglione to design and construct a collection of structures built in a curious pseudo-Baroque style that mingled Euro-<lb/>
pean and Chinese elements (see fig. 6.35).</p>
<p>In <date when="1860">1860</date>, <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name> was completely destroyed by the British and French as the last venge-<lb/>
ful act in a war in which <name type="place">Great Britain</name> and <name type="place">France</name> forced the Chinese to grant additional trade privileges to Western countries. On <date when="--10-18">October 18</date>, a British corps invaded the garden grounds, ransacked its buildings, and then set fire to the entire complex. The flames consumed not only the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name>, but also sev-<lb/>
eral other adjacent pleasure palaces and their parks.</p>

<p>Among the parks burned by the British and French in <date when="1860">1860</date> was the <name type="pname">Yi He Yuan</name>, the Garden of Ease and Harmony, one of the five major parks, including the <name type="pname">Yuan Ming Yuan</name>, that once adorned the Western Hills. This park, also the creation of Qianlong, who built it in honor of his mother's sixtieth birthday, was rebuilt by the <name type="pname">Dowager Empress Cixi</name> in celebration of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sixtieth birthday in <date when="1894">1894</date>. Once more put to the torch by Europeans in the Boxer Rebellion of <date when="1900">1900</date>, it was restored again by the empress in <date when="1902">1902</date>.</p>
<p>In the center of the <name type="pname">Yi He Yuan</name> there is a sheet of light-reflecting, lotus-blooming water called Kun-<lb/>
ming Lake. It has a circumference of 4 miles (6.4 kilo-<lb/>
meters) and occupies approximately 500 of the park's 725 acres. Originally no more than a marshy pond, it was dredged and enlarged by the Qianlong emperor, who built an aqueduct system to feed it and other imperial lakes.</p>
<p>Stretching for almost half a mile (.8 kilometers) along the north side of Kunming Lake is the remark-<lb/>
able Long Gallery (Chang Lang), giving architectural definition to the gentle curves of the shoreline and providing, through ornamental frames of wooden lat-<lb/>

<p>The views looking west from the eastern shore of the lake are enriched by a series of bridges, each unique in its design. The causeway that traverses the lake, dividing it into one large lake and two smaller ones, incorporates six bridges.

<p>Throughout its long history, the plants of the Chinese garden design remained those traditional ones cele-<lb/>
brated in poetry and painting, which were derived from conventional symbolical association. Certain favorite flowers, such as peonies, were cultivated in masses, and their springtime bloom in the garden was the occa-<lb/>
sion for entertaining friends. Chrysanthemums, which like pines were revered as long-lived survivors, were the focus of special vantage points designed for fall viewing.</p>
<p>Indeed, consideration of the Chinese garden's movement through the cycle of the seasons counted as much for garden designers as its careful sequencing in spatial terms. It was thought that a light dusting of snow in the winter best revealed its essential architecture and the lines of force and mass that constituted a well-de-<lb/>
signed "mountain." Most apparent in that season are the "three friends of winter"&#x2014;pine, bamboo, and plum, with their respective symbolical associations of longev-<lb/>
ity, hardiness, and strength of character; pliable and supple nature capable of lasting friendship; and delicate beauty even in old age. In summer the mirrorlike sur-<lb/>
face of the pond traded its cloud reflections and reverse shoreline imagery for an efflorescence of lotuses. Lift-<lb/>
ing their stalks out of the mud, they formed a verdant mat of waxy leaves dotted with pale flowers, a symbol of the purity and victory of the spirit over the senses. Thus, change itself and the anticipation of change, with all the associations of life, death, and renewal implied by seasonal transformation, are a conscious dimension of Chinese garden design.</p>
<p>Today the perpetuation of this style of gar-<lb/>
den-making is more a matter of replication of historic models than one of authentic landscape creation inspired by poetry and painting. Its influence can be traced in other lands in gardens that also aspired to cap-<lb/>
ture the spirit-force of nature through landscape art. Among these are the Chinese garden's direct descen-<lb/>
dants, which are found within the precincts of the tem-<lb/>
ples and palaces of <name type="place">Japan</name>.</p>

<p>Chinese garden concepts arrived in <name type="place">Japan</name> along with Buddhism in the sixth century. Although sharing a sim-<lb/>
ilar aesthetic approach, the gardens built in the small, well-watered island nation of <name type="place">Japan</name> would ultimately differ from those of <name type="place">China</name>, a country of vastly greater dimensions, a land of contrasting wide plains and moun-<lb/>
tainous precipices. After appropriating Chinese garden concepts, instead of continuing to create "recollections" of famous scenes in nature in the Chinese manner, Jap-<lb/>
anese garden designers increasingly sought a generic ideal of nature in conformity with the scale and topog-<lb/>
raphy of their own natural landscape.</p>
<p>The eleventh-century treatise known as the <hi rend="italic">Saku-<lb/>
teiki</hi>, presumably written by <name type="pname">Tachibana no Toshitsuna</name> (<date when="1028">1028</date>&#x2013;<date when="1084">1084</date>), is <name type="place">Japan</name>'s earliest known manual of gar-<lb/>
den rules.<ref target="#CH8-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> In it one finds prescriptions for the han-<lb/>
dling of stones set within moving water in the so-called "large river style." The <hi rend="italic">Sakuteiki</hi> counsels that, in order to make a proper garden, one should travel widely and become acquainted with beautiful scenes in nature, indicating that by this time the Japanese had singled out various famous views as prized components of their country's natural landscape. Besides giving precise instructions for building waterfalls and other garden features, the author encourages gardeners to orient their buildings to the south according to the principles of geomancy. Logically, streams should be placed on this, their most open, side. He prescribed that these flow from east to west in order to cleanse the evil air ema-<lb/>
nating from the northeast and ward off demons. In addition to following these prescriptions of the <hi rend="italic">Saku-<lb/>
teiki</hi>, Japanese garden designers often incorporated a distant vista in their designs in order to enlarge the visual sphere of the usually quite small garden and to reinforce its connection with the natural world. They referred to this technique of borrowing scenery as <hi rend="italic">shak-<lb/>
kei</hi>.</p>
<p>Buddhist creation mythology and <name type="pname">Daoist</name> belief in the paradisaical Isles of the Blest furnished the lake-<lb/>
and-islands motif that underlies the composition of many Japanese gardens, even those compressed visions of a Zen Buddhist universe known as <hi rend="italic">kare sansui</hi>, or dry landscapes. Beginning in the thirteenth century, members of the newly imported Zen sect designed these spare, almost austere, gardens as aids to medita-<lb/>
tion. These are minimalist compositions of carefully positioned stones, which are meant to be read as islands in a dry "river" of carefully raked gravel or sand or as mountains in a landscape of mosses. Such Zen-inspired gardens played an important role among members of the ruling classes; certain emperors and even some sho-<lb/>
guns&#x2014;powerful military dictators who ruled under the nominal authority of the emperor&#x2014;found garden-mak-<lb/>
ing to be a satisfying escape from court politics and civil strife. The tea ceremony, developed in the late fifteenth century, was not a religious exercise, but it nevertheless provided a disciplined experience of con-<lb/>
centration and aesthetic and spiritual refreshment for which passage along a garden path of moss and stones offered a prescribed prelude and conclusion.</p>
<p>The Japanese combined their penchant for cul-<lb/>
tural appropriation with a talent for reinvention. <name type="place">Japan</name>'s island geography and a semi-isolationist policy during much of its history fostered the assimilation and trans-<lb/>
formation of those ideas and forms that were adopted from the outside into a vigorous native expression. The arrival of <name type="pname">Commodore Matthew Perry</name>'s American ships in <name type="place">Tokyo Bay</name> in <date when="1853">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">54</date> ended the country's previous two centuries of closure to all but Dutch and Chinese traders, whose access was strictly limited. Increasing transactions with the West started <name type="place">Japan</name> on a path of profound change. Without some degree of cultural isolation and the focused aestheticism that matured the Japanese garden into a great art form, the slow but creative evolution that counts as development within a traditional artistic idiom came to a standstill. Its assimilative energies directed toward building a powerful economy and its political life reshaped since <date when="1945">1945</date> as a capitalist democracy, <name type="place">Japan</name> has become today a conservator of its cultural heritage. As in other countries where the government and cultural institu-<lb/>
tions protect a "golden age" of previous artistic accom-<lb/>
plishment, in <name type="place">Japan</name> the state and the religious establishments of Kyoto maintain the incomparable imperial and Buddhist temple gardens as much-appre-<lb/>
ciated heritage icons and tourist attractions.</p>
<p>The talents of Japanese landscape designers today contribute to the pluralistic internationalism of garden art rather than to the continued development of a spe-<lb/>
cifically indigenous style. The <hi rend="italic">vocabulary</hi> of Japanese garden design&#x2014;its abstract compositional harmonies, its elegant rusticity, its "borrowed" views, its asymmet-<lb/>
rical configuration of design elements, its attention to ground plane patterns and textures in the arrangement of moss and stones&#x2014;has furnished inspiration to mod-<lb/>
ern garden designers in other countries. To appreciate more fully the richness of simplicity in this carefully matured language of landscape, we must now review the history of Japanese gardens.</p>

grouping, tree, or other natural object might be revered for its indwelling spirit (fig. 8.18).

Where greater architectural definition is sought, an apron of white gravel may isolate the revered place or object. Ropes, straw fencing, and sometimes cloth banners may also be used as means of demarcation.</p>

<p>The holiest spot in <name type="place">Japan</name> is considered to be the <name type="pname">Shinto</name> shrine at Ise in Mie Prefecture. The shrine enclave includes the Geku, or Outer Shrine, which is dedicated to the provider of grain, and the Naiku, or Inner Shrine, sacred to the heaven-illuminating sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom <name type="place">Japan</name>'s imperial clan once claimed descent. The Inner Shrine is set within a clearing within a cryptomeria forest and is reached by a ceremonial path that passes through <hi rend="italic">torii</hi>, over the Isuzu River, and through the forest to the clearing (fig. 8.20).</p>
<p>The Inner Shrine precinct contains the <hi rend="italic">honden</hi>, the main hall of the Inner Shrine, and two treasure houses. All are enclosed within three concentric fences and accessible only through gates on the short ends of the rectangular plot of white gravel on which they sit; adjacent and sharing common fencing within the clearing is an identical rectangular plot of gravel that serves as the alternate building site. The active shrine consists of a group of simple unpainted wooden structures roofed with the bark of Cyprus trees. Every twenty years&#x2014;most recently in <date when="1993">1993</date>&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">honden</hi>, whose simple form is derived from Yayoi-period (c. 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>&#x2013;c. 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi>) raised rice granaries, is rebuilt and rededicated. Only a small structure in the middle of the otherwise empty plain of gravel protects the <hi rend="italic">shin no mihashira</hi>, or heart post, a structural member of the previous shrine, which is left standing.</p>
<p>Historians believe that white gravel aprons such as this are predecessors of the <hi rend="italic">yuniwa</hi>, the entry court of palaces and other monumental structures, a purified space that is empty or contains at most a pair of sym-<lb/>
bolic trees. The more worldly culture of a later period turned the <hi rend="italic">yuniwa</hi> of noble residences into a secular, landscaped space, but those relating to shrines remained as religiously austere as the one at Ise. The majesty of the towering cryptomeria trees constitutes the more grand architectural expression of the Ise

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Nara and Heian Courts</hi></hi></head>
<p>Buddhism was introduced from <name type="place">China</name> into <name type="place">Japan</name> in 552. Under the regent, <name type="pname">Prince Shotoku</name> (573&#x2013;621), who promoted it and built temples, it gained the kind of institutional status enjoyed by Christianity in the West after the reign of <name type="pname">Constantine the Great</name>. The acceptance of Buddhism, together with contacts with Korea and the first official Japanese embassy to <name type="place">China</name> in the early seventh century, stimulated the adoption of Chinese artistic and architectural forms. Formerly, rulers had constructed their dwellings in the vernacu-<lb/>
lar style of the structures at the Ise Shrine. Moreover, because of the premium put upon spatial purification and ritual rebuilding, the capital was moved at the beginning of each new reign. In 710, however, the court was established at Nara, and there it remained for the next seventy-five years through several reigns.</p>
<p>The plan of the city, with its hierarchical order-<lb/>
ing of space within a grid layout, was, at a lesser scale, a conscious imitation of that of Chang'an, the Chinese Tang dynasty capital. The temples constructed to house large images of <name type="pname">Buddha</name> were unlike any previ-<lb/>
ous Japanese architectural forms. The spatial layout of their surrounding compounds also followed Chinese models.</p>
<p>Korean craftsmen were brought to Nara to help develop imperial gardens in the Chinese manner, with lakes and rock arrangements forming islands. From archaeological excavations, as well as from paintings and poetry of this period, we surmise that these were similar to the Tang models they sought to imitate, being <hi rend="italic">yarimizu</hi>, or river-style gardens. Their meander-<lb/>
ing streams furnished the opportunity to organize poetry competitions like the ones popular in contem-<lb/>
porary Chinese gardens.</p>
<p>Upon ascending the throne in 781, <name type="pname">Emperor Kammu</name> decided to move the capital once more, prob-<lb/>
ably in order to separate the government from the influence of priests at Nara, who, to his distress, had amassed considerable political power. After ten years of building this new capital, Nagaoka-ky&#x014D;, the not-<lb/>
yet-finished city was abandoned in favor of another site nearby, Heian-ky&#x014D;, meaning the Capital of Peace and Tranquility, the original name of Kyoto. Once established, Kyoto became the imperial capital of <name type="place">Japan</name> for more than a thousand years until the Meiji Restoration in <date when="1868">1868</date>, when <name type="place">Tokyo</name> was made the capi-<lb/>
tal.</p>
<p>In Kyoto, as at Nara, the gridiron plan of Chang'an formed the model for a new city roughly half Nara's size, or 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) north to south by 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) east to west (fig. 8.21).<ref target="#CH8-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> Also, as at Nara, the imperial enclosure, known as the Daidairi, was placed at the end of a broad axis at the city's northern end. The surrounding city was subdivided into 76 large squares, measuring approximately 400 feet (122 meters) to a side. The eastern half of this residential grid became the location of choice for the nobility; however, the western half was never developed in accordance with its original outlines. In an attempt to avoid the political tensions that had existed at Nara, the emperor mandated that new temples be sited outside the city, and these were therefore built on the lower slopes of the surrounding hills, as were estates of the powerful nobility.</p>

<p>In the Heian period (781&#x2013;1185), a golden age for Kyoto, all the arts, including landscape design, were held in high esteem. Gardens in this period were ampler than later ones, and the lakes in them were gen-<lb/>
erous in size. Fortunately for posterity, <name type="pname">Murasaki Shi-<lb/>
kibu</name> (970?&#x2013;1026?), a lady of the court, chronicled the aesthetic pursuits of the elite during the Heian era in <hi rend="italic">The Tale of Genji</hi>, a novel written around the year <date when="1000">1000</date>.<ref target="#CH8-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref> In it we read of <name type="pname">Prince Genji</name> in many beautiful garden settings as he enjoys such pastimes as rowing in Chinese-style boats around the islands in the lake or going on an outing to admire the fall foliage (fig. 8.22). Inspired by Chinese models, these islands consisted of arrangements of rocks, some intended to suggest the form of a symbolically meaningful tortoise or crane. Pavilions in the style known as <hi rend="italic">shinden-zukuri</hi> stood at the edge of the water. These structures, derived from
<pb n="298"/>
<pb n="298" type="orig"/>
Chinese architectural norms, were elegant in their lines but rustic in character, with reticulated two-part shutters that could be raised in summer. Their floors were pol-<lb/>
ished wood, as tatami mats and other specifically Japa-<lb/>
nese conventions had not yet become established. These viewing platforms were actually projecting wings of a large central pavilion, or <hi rend="italic">shinden</hi>, that faced the lake. A swath of white sand at the lake's edge served as a stage for mime and dance performances, which could be enjoyed from a <hi rend="italic">shinden-zukuri</hi> pavilion.

<p>Within <name type="place">Japan</name>'s feudal social structure, the powerful <name type="pname">Fujiwara</name> clan had gained supremacy by 850, and in their role as regents for emperors in their minority, members of this family gradually appropriated much of the impe-<lb/>
rial power and married into the imperial family. Their chief, <name type="pname">Fujiwara no Michinaga</name> (966&#x2013;1027), held the title of <hi rend="italic">kampaku</hi>, a high governmental position in which he mediated between the emperor and court officials in affairs of state. As respected but powerless figureheads, emperors typically spent their lives engaged in cultural pursuits. Making a virtue of their relatively reduced cir-<lb/>
cumstances, they refined their chosen style, which was derived from rustic vernacular architecture, into a vocab-<lb/>
ulary of elegantly crafted details and beautifully propor-<lb/>
tioned parts. By contrast, the <name type="pname">Fujiwara</name>, like the shoguns who followed them, liked to display their power in works of magnificence. The splendor of the Heian period is found in the By&#x014D;d&#x014D;-in, built as a villa by the <hi rend="italic">kampaku</hi> <name type="pname">Fujiwara Yorimichi</name> (992&#x2013;1074) on his estate south of Kyoto and converted into a temple in <date when="1052">1052</date> (fig. 8.23).</p>

The Minamoto established headquarters at the town of Kamakura, which gave its name to the period of their ascendancy.

<p>The Kamakura period (<date when="1185">1185</date>&#x2013;<date when="1333">1333</date>) is notable for the widespread adoption of the Chinese sect of Chan Bud-<lb/>
dhism, known in <name type="place">Japan</name> as Zen Buddhism. Introduced as early as the seventh century by the priest D&#x014D;sh&#x014D; (629&#x2013;700) following his return from <name type="place">China</name>, Zen Buddhism was long overshadowed in <name type="place">Japan</name> by the powerful Tendai and Shingon sects. But the aus-<lb/>
terity and simplicity of Zen religion as professed by the monk Eisai (<date when="1141">1141</date>&#x2013;<date when="1215">1215</date>) upon his return from <name type="place">China</name> in <date when="1192">1192</date>, appealed to the warrior class. As it prospered under their sponsorship, its reductive aes-<lb/>
thetic guided the design of certain temple gardens.</p>
<p>Equally important for designed landscapes at this time were the currents of aesthetic thought ema-<lb/>
nating from the Southern Song dynasty (<date when="1127">1127</date>&#x2013;<date when="1279">1279</date>) in <name type="place">China</name>. The vertical positioning of carefully selected rocks, typical of Song gardens, can be found in Japanese gardens of this era, whereas later stone-<lb/>
work emphasized a horizontality that is less dramatic and more in keeping with the inherent quietude of <name type="place">Japan</name>'s natural landscape forms. More important than this, however, was the poetic idealization of land-<lb/>
scape and the relationship between landscape design and painting found in Song garden art, qualities that exerted a strong influence on the development of the Japanese garden.</p>
<p>The Kamakura era and the subsequent Muroma-<lb/>
chi period effected a transition in landscape design from the great Heian residential lake gardens of the nobility to the Zen minimalism represented by the monastic garden of Ry&#x014D;an-ji, built between <date when="1500">1500</date> and <date when="1700">1700</date>. In the beautiful river district of Arashiyama in northwestern Kyoto, Tenry&#x016B;-ji, an estate garden built around <date when="1256">1256</date> and later converted into a monastery, exhibits the Song influence in its boldly conceived dry cascade and vertical rock arrangements. From a bridge made of three natural stone slabs, there is a view of a harmoniously balanced composition of seven rocks set in the water so as to suggest one of the Mystic Isles of the Immortals in Chinese legend (fig. 8.24). In <date when="1339">1339</date>, the estate was converted into a Zen Buddhist foundation by <name type="pname">Mus&#x014D; Soseki</name> (also known as <name type="pname">Mus&#x014D; Kokushi</name>, <date when="1275">1275</date>&#x2013;<date when="1351">1351</date>), one of <name type="place">Japan</name>'s most significant religious figures and a gifted garden designer. Some garden historians believe that this serene and paradi-<lb/>
saical garden, which today is operated by the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism, was reworked by <name type="pname">Mus&#x014D; Soseki</name> and is an example of his artistry. Though less than an acre in size and containing a pond that is only 100 by 200 feet (30.5 by 61 meters), it has some-<lb/>
thing of the atmosphere of the old Heian <hi rend="italic">shinden</hi> lake garden. Its surrounding views are now obscured by vegetation, but it originally drew into its small com-<lb/>
pass the distant crowns of Arashiyama and Kamey-<lb/>
ama mountains, providing what is possibly the earliest Japanese example we have of the technique of bor-<lb/>
rowed scenery.</p>

<p>Nearby, at Saih&#x014D;-ji, another temple of the Rinzai Zen Buddhist sect, <name type="pname">Mus&#x014D; Soseki</name> began in <date when="1339">1339</date> to reconstruct an existing garden after it had been prac-<lb/>

<pb n="300"/>
<pb n="300" type="orig"/>

</figure>
<p>The upper garden on the hillside extends the Zen experience. Here one finds a dry cascade, thought to be the first example of a <hi rend="italic">kare sansui</hi> com-<lb/>
position in a Japanese garden. Its absence of water suggests <hi rend="italic">mu</hi>, or "no-thing-ness," which is emblem-<lb/>
atic of Zen teaching. Its flat-topped rocks, perfectly arranged so as to suggest a waterfall in nature, are unlike the vertically positioned rocks at Tenry&#x016B;-ji and mark the beginning in Japanese stone compositions of a preference for horizontal lines. These rocks are more sympathetically allied with the native landscape than upthrust ones, which were originally intended to evoke Chinese mountain scenery. As rock artistry continued to develop in <name type="place">Japan</name>, vertical stones were still used as accents, but handsome flat stones became increasingly prized by garden designers as an import-<lb/>
ant means of creating effects of tranquil beauty (fig. 8.26). In other words, in Japanese garden design, as in painting, the influence of Chinese models remained present as a continuing source of inspiration, but local traditions and local imagery modified received forms into an indigenous cultural expression. The oxymo-<lb/>
ronic notion of a <hi rend="italic">dry cascade</hi> is like a Zen <hi rend="italic">k&#x014D;an</hi>, puz-<lb/>
zling and without apparent logic, a means of frustrating rational thought and pushing the acolyte toward a deeper, more intuitive understanding.</p>
<p>The transcendent quality of this garden derives in part from <name type="pname">Mus&#x014D; Soseki</name>'s rockwork and in part from the patina of age. For the last hundred years or so, many varieties of moss have been encouraged to grow into a thick velvety tapestry that now covers the entire ground plane. Meticulously groomed, this soft blanket of gleaming green moss accounts for the gar-<lb/>
den's alternate name, Kokedera, or Moss Temple. Vigorous restraint, rich economy, and tradition-fed originality remained characteristic of Japanese gar-<lb/>
dens even as they continued to incorporate Chinese forms into a new idiom of elegant austerity.</p>

<p>Kamakura rule was superseded by that of the <name type="pname">Ashik-<lb/>
aga</name> shogunate in what is referred to as the Muroma-<lb/>
chi period (<date when="1333">1333</date>&#x2013;<date when="1573">1573</date>), named after the northeastern section of Kyoto, where the third shogun, <name type="pname">Ashikaga Yoshimitsu</name> (<date when="1358">1358</date>&#x2013;<date when="1408">1408</date>), built his palace. Called Hana no Gosho, or Flowery Palace, it had a beautiful lake garden. Active trade with <name type="place">China</name> had brought renewed enthusiasm for Chinese Song arts to <name type="place">Japan</name>. Antique Song paintings and porcelains and Ming works in the Song style were eagerly sought, and in spite of famine, plague, and a series of earthquakes, connoisseurship flourished among the ruling elite.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name>, a Zen follower, left his office nom-<lb/>
inally in the hands of his nine-year-old son, and retired to a private estate outside the city where a fine old garden from the early thirteenth century already existed. He renamed the place Kitayama (North Hill) Villa. Here, around <date when="1397">1397</date>, he set about building Kinkaku, or Golden Pavilion, as his private chapel (fig. 8.27). In the Golden Pavilion and its successor, the Silver Pavilion, we see the effects of patronage by wealthy shoguns: garden designs derived from a fusion of Chinese Song and Japanese Zen aesthetics. The villa was converted to a Zen temple and renamed Rokuon-ji in <date when="1408">1408</date> upon <name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name>'s death. Popu-<lb/>
<pb n="301"/>
<pb n="301" type="orig"/>
larly known as Kinkaku-ji (Temple of the Golden Pavilion) by later generations, this remarkable three-storied structure (actually a mid-twentieth-cen-<lb/>
tury replica of the only remaining part of <name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name>'s original <hi rend="italic">shinden</hi>-style, mansion) is perched over the water of the lake.<ref target="#CH8-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> The lower floor, Amida Hall, was used as a reception room; the second, Kannon Hall, as a place for conversation and connoisseurship; while the third story, with its bell-shaped windows, probably functioned as a Zen meditation room. The gold-leafed ceiling of this room as well as its gold-lacquered exte-<lb/>
rior furnished the pavilion with its name. The Golden Pavilion is a delicately poetic structure, especially when its soaring eaves are dusted with snow and the pines and pond beside it are similarly whitened.</p>
<p>Although converted into a temple foundation following <name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name>'s death, <name type="pname">Kinkaku-ji</name> was first and foremost a princely pleasure ground. Its lake may inspire a state of spiritual reverie, but it was also used for boating parties, and the proudest event of <name type="pname">Yoshim-<lb/>
itsu</name>'s life occurred when he entertained the emperor and members of the court at a house party upon the garden's completion in <date when="1408">1408</date>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Kinkaku-ji</name>'s garden of only four-and-one-half acres was composed (it is thought by <name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name> him-<lb/>
self) in two parts&#x2014;a lower lake garden and and upper "mountain" garden with tea houses&#x2014;with such art-<lb/>
istry that it augments itself through illusion. The lake, which covers a third of the garden surface, is divided by a peninsula and related central island into a heart-character shape (<hi rend="italic">kokoro</hi>). Its waters reflect the Silk Hat Hill (Kinugasa-yama) that lies beyond its encircling pines. Song influence and Japanese aesthet-<lb/>
ics are evident in the careful selection and the place-<lb/>
ment of rocks into studied arrangements within the lake. Some of these are meant to evoke the nine moun-<lb/>
tains and eight seas in the Buddhist myth of creation. In addition, other interestingly formed rocks were placed as elements of islands. Several rock composi-<lb/>
tions take the shape of tortoises. The crane, another longevity symbol, is the motif for an island in front of the pavilion. Many of these beautifully arranged rocks were gifts to <name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name>; often they have flat tops, a form that was increasingly admired among Japanese garden rock collectors.</p>
<p>In subsequent periods of Japanese garden his-<lb/>
tory, fine stones were frequently carted from a ruined or impoverished garden to a new one. For instance, in <date when="1474">1474</date>, following his retirement from the shogunate, Yoshimasa (<date when="1436">1436</date>&#x2013;<date when="1490">1490</date>), grandson of <name type="pname">Yoshimitsu</name>, had some of the stones and pine trees of the Flowery Pal-<lb/>
ace and Muromachi Hall, both of which had been dev-<lb/>
astated by civil warfare, removed to his villa retreat at the base of Higashiyama (the Eastern Hills). There he lived from <date when="1483">1483</date> until his death, when the villa was converted to a Zen temple, <name type="pname">Jish&#x014D;-ji</name>, or <name type="pname">Ginkaku-ji</name> (the Temple of the Silver Pavilion), as it is better known. Rockwork became a professional occupation for a certain outcast segment of society, men who engaged in various kinds of necessary "dirty work." Some of these, such as Zen'ami (d. <date when="1482">1482</date>), who worked at sev-<lb/>
eral of the great Muromachi estates, were talented garden craftsmen and much in demand.</p>

<p>Daisen-in is one of the subsidiary temple gardens in the great Zen monastery of Daitoku-ji built around <date when="1513">1513</date> by <name type="pname">Kogaku</name> (or <name type="pname">S&#x014D;k&#x014D;</name>, <date when="1464">1464</date>&#x2013;<date when="1548">1548</date>), the founder of the temple, perhaps with the help of the artist <name type="pname">S&#x014D;ami</name> (<date when="1485">1485</date>&#x2013;<date when="1525">1525</date>), whose landscape paintings adorn the interior walls. This small garden, only 12 feet (3.7 meters) wide and 47 feet (14.3 meters) long, is an exquisite rendition of the kind of mountain scenery found in Song painting (fig. 8.28). It is built in the <hi rend="italic">kare sansui</hi>, or dry garden style, which was perfected in the Muromachi period. Read as intended from left to right, it offers the viewer a "waterfall" of white gravel that comes spilling and pooling between a series of vertically placed rocks, to flow under a small stone "bridge" and then fan out into a beautiful raked gravel "river" where a stone "boat" is seen floating. The remarkable boat-shaped rock once belonged to the shogun-aesthete Yoshimasa, builder of the Silver Pavilion. A curious divider, a narrow roofed bridge, bisects the garden. It is a twentieth-century reconstruc-<lb/>
tion based upon architectural and graphic evidence of a bridge that was in place during the Edo period (<date when="1603">1603</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>). From the side where the raked gravel river flows around rock islands toward an implied ocean beyond the garden wall, a bell-shaped window frames a view of the miniature mountains and water-<lb/>
fall where the "river" has its source.</p>
<p>Just as Western art at the beginning of the twen-<lb/>
tieth century transcended representation to achieve abstraction, a similar change occurred in <name type="place">Japan</name> at the beginning of the sixteenth century. This transition to a more reductive expression is evidenced by the cre-<lb/>
ation of the Zen garden at Ry&#x014D;an-ji (Subdued Dragon Temple), which consists of nothing more than fifteen moss-fringed stones placed in a bed of white quartz gravel evenly scored with the long continuous marks of a rake (fig. 8.29).</p>
<p>Ry&#x014D;an-ji's minimalist <hi rend="italic">kare sansui</hi> garden has held great fascination for Western architects and gar-<lb/>
den historians since the <date when="1930">1930</date>s when, conditioned by modernism, they began to understand its formal prin-<lb/>
ciples. Some have sought to understand it in meta-<lb/>
physical terms as well. For these reasons it has been extensively analyzed both allegorically and as a set of mathematical relationships in which five groupings of stones are held within their gravel bed in an arrange-<lb/>
ment of perfectly balanced tension. Viewed from left to right, this arrangement reads as follows: five stones, then two, next three, again two, and finally three stones. Sitting at any point on the veranda, the viewer will always find one stone is hidden from sight. Like that of a painting by the Dutch artist <name type="pname">Piet Mondrian</name> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944">1944</date>), the compositional balance of this gar-<lb/>
den can only be grasped intuitively, not analyzed log-<lb/>
ically. Neither mathematical explanation nor allegorical meaning can be attached to it. To achieve either would rob it of its enigmatic quality and thereby make it less satisfying from a Zen perspective, as the inexplicability it offers is fundamental to Zen experi-<lb/>
ence and an intrinsic factor in its design. Its true power can only be felt if one is able to experience it over an extended period of quiet meditation and without the distraction of tourists. To appreciate fully its power as a work of art, one must suspend thought and enjoy not only the dynamic stasis of the rocks and the rhythmic lines running through the white gravel, but also the warm buff tones of the unassuming earthen wall with its tile roof and the borrowed scenery beyond it.</p>

<p>Japanese art, including garden art, demonstrates the richness of restraint and the power of understate-<lb/>
ment. But Japanese cultural history is not one unbro-<lb/>
ken chain of aesthetic refinement in which the modernist dictum of "less is more" is made continu-<lb/>
ally manifest. At the opposite end of the spectrum from the austerity of Ry&#x014D;an-ji are the gardens such as the one at Samb&#x014D;-in, created during the rule of <name type="pname">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</name> (<date when="1536">1536</date>&#x2013;<date when="1598">1598</date>), the second of three generals who united <name type="place">Japan</name> in the late sixteenth century after a prolonged period of civil war. <name type="pname">Hidey-<lb/>
oshi</name> quickly maneuvered himself into the title of <hi rend="italic">kampaku</hi>. From that position as intermediary between the emperor and court officials, he brazenly reduced them to impotence and dependency and made himself dictator. His alliances with, and domi-<lb/>
nance over, <name type="place">Japan</name>'s other feudal warlords concen-<lb/>
trated much of the country's wealth in his hands. Of plebian birth rather than part of the samurai aristoc-<lb/>
racy, he lacked early training in Zen aesthetics, and it is thus not surprising that he often used this wealth to indulge his desire for opulence.</p>
<p>Architectural gilding was the order of the day in the huge buildings <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> erected. On the site of the old Imperial Palace, he put up the Jurakutei, his moat-surrounded Kyoto castle. There he amassed a huge collection of specimen rocks, gifts from his subject lords. But by <date when="1588">1588</date> he had the Jurakutei dis-<lb/>
mantled and some of its buildings moved to his res-<lb/>
idence, Osaka Castle, and to the new palace he had built at Fushimi. The latter was located in the south-<lb/>
ern Kyoto suburb known as the Momoyama district; from it comes the name of the Momoyama period (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1603">1603</date>), which is synchronous with the hege-<lb/>
mony of <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> and the rulers immediately pre-<lb/>
ceding and following him. After <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name>'s death, Fushimi Castle and its exotic gardens containing sago palm trees were also dismantled. The stones from his lavish Tiger Glen, or Kokei Garden, were transferred to the temple of Nishi Hongan-ji, and the impressive ceremonial architecture of Fushimi was disassembled and redistributed to this and other tem-<lb/>
ples in and around Kyoto.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Hills, not far from the site of Fus-<lb/>
himi Castle, <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> decided to refurbish the gar-<lb/>
den of Samb&#x014D;-in, a subtemple of Dai-go-ji, in preparation for a massive spring outing to view cherry blossoms. Although <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> died before the garden could be finished, the abbot Gien of Dai-<lb/>
go-ji supervised the completion of this richly con-<lb/>
ceived garden (fig. 8.30). Many of the choice rocks from <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name>'s garden at the Jurakutei were trans-<lb/>
ferred to Samb&#x014D;-in, including a highly prized rectan-<lb/>
gular pale-colored one called the Fujito Stone, which had acquired a certain fame before <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> bought it for five thousand bushels of rice.</p>

<p>By this time, rock craftsmen, were employed in the selection and positioning of garden stones. Yoshir&#x014D;, known as Kentei, or Excellent Gardener, worked for twenty years, until <date when="1618">1618</date>, arranging the nearly eight hundred rocks found at Samb&#x014D;-in into a composition that, if somewhat restless, is neverthe-<lb/>
less a boldly dynamic expression of the energy invested in garden design in the Momoyama period.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name>'s taste, though opulent, was also broad, and he was interested in the development of the Japanese tea ceremony, <hi rend="italic">cha no yu</hi>, by <name type="pname">Sen no Riky&#x016B;</name> (<date when="1521">1521</date>&#x2013;<date when="1591">1591</date>), who made this secular, aesthetic pursuit into a spiritual experience as well. Originated in Song <name type="place">China</name> and developed in <name type="place">Japan</name> at the Silver Pavilion by the Zen monk Murata Juk&#x014D; (<date when="1423">1423</date>&#x2013;<date when="1502">1502</date>) during the Muromachi era, the tea ceremony became one of the most important and lasting developments of the Momoyama period, deepening the ingrained aes-<lb/>
theticism of Japanese culture and giving a new dimen-<lb/>
sion to the refined rusticity of the Japanese garden in which <hi rend="italic">sabi</hi>&#x2014;the mellow agedness produced by weathered stone, mosses, and lichens&#x2014;is highly val-<lb/>
ued.</p>
<p>The ritual of the tea ceremony as formulated by <name type="pname">Sen no Riky&#x016B;</name> requires for its enactment a pattern of precise movements, a particular kind of setting, and certain elegantly simple utensils. It is conducted in a small, thatch-roofed hut with wattle-and-daub walls, the rustic simplicity of which is meant to induce a mood of <hi rend="italic">wabi</hi>, refined austerity. Only a small upper window covered with bamboo lattice admits light to the tearoom. Guests must stoop to enter. Inside the tea house, the garden view is intentionally blocked from sight, leaving the focus of the tearoom, which is commonly four-and-a-half tatami mats in size,<ref target="#CH8-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref> upon the <hi rend="italic">tokonoma</hi>, a small alcove wherein a partic-<lb/>

ment may be displayed. The host enters and begins to prepare tea, as the three or four guests attune their-senses to the gentle hissing of the steam kettle. The host places the tea in a ceramic tea bowl and, with a bamboo whisk, stirs it with precise and practiced motions into a light green foam, then hands the bowl to the most important guest. The tea bowl itself, like every other carefully positioned object in the room, is a focus of aesthetic admiration. After the tea has been drunk, the beauty of the bowl's form and glaze is silently admired. It is then returned to the host, who wipes it clean and prepares tea for the next guest.</p>

<p>The secluded intimacy of the tea ceremony did not require the same kind of well-composed garden space as that of a temple. What was sought was a means of separation from the busy surrounding world and a way of declaring entry into another realm. This was accomplished by the <hi rend="italic">cha niwa</hi>, or tea garden path, sometimes called <hi rend="italic">roji</hi>, meaning "dewy path." Typically, this is a narrow corridor leading from the street, through a gate made of open-weave bamboo, into a small area where a natural stone basin invites the guest to bend down and wash his hands before stooping again to pass through the small door of the tea house. A fence of bamboo twigs encloses this small garden. Understand-<lb/>
ably, azaleas or other showy plants are not grown in such a place; a tea garden's most notable aspect is the ground plane itself. Here flat stepping-stones are set within moss. These differ from the stones carefully selected for color, shape, surface modeling, and patina, which are found in other types of Japanese gardens. Strictly utilitarian, stones for the <hi rend="italic">cha niwa</hi> are usually rounded river-washed stones, which speak the language of nature and enhance the atmosphere of rusticity and mood of quiet expectation one experiences upon approaching the tea house.</p>
<p>The stepping-stone path of the small tea garden actually plays an important role in the development of the Japanese garden overall, being the precursor of the paths of the much larger stroll garden, such as those in the imperial garden of Katsura Riky&#x016B;. The laying of these and other kinds of stones in the ground, with attention paid to size, texture, form, and line, is an art form in itself. This accounts for much of the pleasure one experiences in viewing the ground plane of Japa-<lb/>
nese gardens.</p>
<p>Another important feature contributed by the tea garden to other kinds of Japanese gardens is the stone lantern (fig. 8.32). Originally found in Buddhist tem-<lb/>
ples, where they were lit for votive offerings, these lan-<lb/>
terns were appropriated by the tea garden in order to illuminate at night the path and the stone hand-washing laver near the tea house (fig. 8.31). They became admired objects in their own right and were soon being copied and then designed by tea masters in a manner that was different from that of their temple prototypes.</p>
<p>Today the separate schools for tea instruction begun by <name type="pname">Sen no Riky&#x016B;</name>'s three great-grandsons&#x2014;<name type="pname">Ura Senke</name>, <name type="pname">Omote Senke</name>, and <name type="pname">Mushan&#x00F4;koji Senke</name>&#x2014;still exist with their own tea gardens in Kyoto. Although many old tea gardens have vanished, the popularity of the tea ceremony is such that many new ones can be found both in <name type="place">Japan</name> and abroad.</p>

<p>Following <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name>'s death, his five-year-old son <name type="pname">Hideyori</name> inherited his authority. The samurai leader <name type="pname">Tokugawa Ieyasu</name> (<date when="1542">1542</date>&#x2013;<date when="1616">1616</date>), who had been appointed as one of the boy's five guardians, soon maneuvered himself into a position of supremacy. This provoked other barons into a power struggle against him, leading to civil conflict, a situation always immi-<lb/>
nent in <name type="place">Japan</name>'s feudal society. <name type="pname">Ieyasu</name> triumphed over his opponents in <date when="1600">1600</date>, assuming for himself the role of all-powerful shogun in <date when="1603">1603</date>. He moved to Edo, now <name type="place">Tokyo</name>, and from his castle there, he systematically cir-<lb/>
cumscribed the actions of the country's other strong families.</p>
<p>The Edo period (<date when="1603">1603</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">1867</date>), as the two-and-one-<lb/>
half-century era of <name type="pname">Tokugawa</name> rule is called, was char-<lb/>
acterized by rigid control of every aspect of Japanese life. Whatever power remained to the emasculated emperor and court was further curtailed by official rules that limited their role exclusively to scholarship and the arts. As such, they were seen as respected custodians of Japanese aesthetics, nothing more. Furthermore, in the the <name type="pname">Tokugawa</name> shoguns' zeal for absolutist control over
<pb n="305"/>
<pb n="305" type="orig"/>
all aspects of Japanese life, they expelled all Christian missionaries and most foreign traders.</p>
<p>It is understandable that, under such circum-<lb/>
stances, escapist impulses would drive the alienated aristocracy to new aesthetic enterprise. <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name> (<date when="1579">1579</date>&#x2013;<date when="1647">1647</date>), although himself a <hi rend="italic">daimyo</hi>, or feudal lord, was a student of <name type="pname">Sen no Riky&#x016B;</name>'s leading disciple, the tea master <name type="pname">Furuta Oribe</name> (<date when="1544">1544</date>&#x2013;<date when="1615">1615</date>). As a tea master himself, <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name> took a natural interest in ceramics, sponsoring the work of various kilns in his province, and as a student of poetry, a noted calligrapher and a garden designer, he was a leading figure in this chapter of <name type="place">Japan</name>'s cultural life.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Kirei sabi</hi> (elegant beauty infused with a weath-<lb/>
ered rustic quality) is the name that attempts to cap-<lb/>
ture the aesthetic ideal promoted by <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name>. It is "beautiful" in that it harks back to the graceful grandeur of the Heian period and expresses an under-<lb/>
standable longing on the part of the court in the Edo era for the days of Heian glory, before the emperor had been robbed of his power. It is "rustic" in that it expresses the pastoral simplicity and closeness to nature advocated by <name type="pname">Sen no Riky&#x016B;</name>.</p>
<p>Although as aristocratic in origin as the Italian and French gardens with which it is contemporary, the air of understatement in <hi rend="italic">kirei sabi</hi> is at the oppo-<lb/>
site extreme from the energetic grandeur of their related styles. In his garden designs, <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name> substituted a diagonal approach for the axial thrust found in Italian villa gardens and at <name type="place">Versailles</name>. This promotes a zigzag movement, creating scenic "sur-<lb/>
prises" as one travels along a prescribed garden route. The technique of hide-and-reveal is, in fact, the essence of the stroll garden, a concept that substitutes movement through a sequence of garden spaces for the stationary viewing mandated by the designs of most <hi rend="italic">shinden</hi>-style gardens and Zen temple gardens. Within the stroll garden, the stepping-stone path of the tea garden is therefore employed for a new pur-<lb/>
pose: the kinetic experience of landscape.</p>
<p>Because the spirit of Katsura Villa epitomizes <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name>'s style of <hi rend="italic">kirei sabi</hi> so perfectly, he has been frequently credited as its designer, although there is no record of his actual participation. Widely regarded as a paragon among gardens, Katsura demonstrates the flowering of aesthetic refinement that occurred when, deprived of all involvement in affairs of state, a member of the imperial family, handsomely supported by gifts from the shogun, devoted his life to building a private never-never land.</p>
<p>Katsura's origins as a garden derive from a problem presented by Imperial <name type="pname">Prince Toshihito</name> (<date when="1571">1571</date>&#x2013;<date when="1629">1629</date>), whom <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> adopted before the latter's own son and heir was born. When <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name> finally produced a biological heir in <date when="1590">1590</date>, he estab-<lb/>
lished <name type="pname">Toshihito</name> as the head of a collateral imperial line. In addition, he gave him a sizable grant of land, which was exchanged for another on the banks of the Katsura River to the west of the city around <date when="1605">1605</date>. A few years later, <name type="pname">Prince Toshihito</name> began building a modest country retreat there, and in the summer of <date when="1616">1616</date>, he invited a group of nobles, poets, and dancers to a festive outing in his "little tea house in the Melon Patch." <name type="pname">Prince Toshihito</name> enjoyed good relations with the shogun as well as a generous income. Thus secure, he was able to expand his building program on his Katsura estate, and by the time of his death in <date when="1629">1629</date>, the place had become a cultural mecca for poets, art-<lb/>
ists, and garden lovers.</p>
<p>Although the country house at Katsura was allowed to deteriorate immediately following <name type="pname">Prince Toshihito</name>'s death, its fortunes were soon revived by his son, young <name type="pname">Prince Toshitada</name> (<date when="1619">1619</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662">1662</date>). In <date when="1632">1632</date>, the thirteen-year-old boy was part of a delega-<lb/>
tion visiting Iemitsu, the third and most powerful sho-<lb/>
gun of the <name type="pname">Tokugawa</name> line, from which he came away with a farewell gift of a thousand pieces of silver and thirty kimonos. Apparently the young man continued to enjoy the shogun's largesse, and he was able during his lifetime to bring the estate to its full glory as an important cultural center and shining example of the <hi rend="italic">shoin</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">shoin zukuri</hi>, style of architecture and the <hi rend="italic">kirei sabi</hi> aesthetic in garden art (fig. 8.33).</p>

</figure>
<p>Almost from the beginning, <name type="pname">Prince Toshitada</name> conceived of the garden as a setting for a series of tea houses. The first, the Geppa-r&#x014D;, or Moon Wave Tower, was built close to the main house. Not far from this tea house, one of the villa's several rustic earth-covered bridges carries the visitor to the Inner Gate. The gate's quiet beauty resides in its harmoni-<lb/>
ous proportions and the carefully crafted details of its
<pb n="306"/>
<pb n="306" type="orig"/>
simple bamboo-and-thatch roof. The design of the paths and the varied patterns of the stone paving around this gate and in the courtyard create a subtly textured ground plane (fig. 8.34).</p>

</figure>
<p>In <date when="1645">1645</date>, <name type="pname">Prince Toshitada</name> journeyed to Edo to request further financial aid from the shogun and during his travels studied the architecture of several notable tea houses. Soon he was hosting tea parties as well as nocturnal moon-viewing and boating parties at Katsura, and by <date when="1649">1649</date>, documents record that there were, in addition to the Geppa-r&#x014D;, four more tea houses. Three of these can still be seen today: the Sh&#x014D;kin-tei, or Pine Lute Pavilion; the Sh&#x014D;ka-tei, or Flower Appreciation Pavilion; and the Sh&#x014D;i-ken, or Laughing Thoughts Pavilion. Katsura's tea house architecture derives from that of rustic farm build-<lb/>
ings; the elegance and simplicity with which this ver-<lb/>
nacular style has been adapted to a refined purpose lies at the heart of the <hi rend="italic">kirei sabi</hi> aesthetic.</p>
<p>Stroll gardens like that of Katsura suggest pre-<lb/>
scribed routes. Stepping-stone paths direct the visi-<lb/>
tor's footsteps from one to another of these tea houses, each exquisitely sited as a feature within the larger landscape. The experience is delightfully disorienting as one repeatedly changes direction and appreciates each new and skillfully arranged view. Like the tea houses, the paths have poetic names such as Maple Riding Lane and Plum Riding Lane. Some of the vil-<lb/>
la's landscapes evoke such famous Japanese scenes as the Bridge of Heaven, here abstracted and depicted at a reduced scale. The topography is graded to pro-<lb/>
duce "mountains," and the stepping stones, like those approaching the Sh&#x014D;ka-tei, are set into these hillsides so skillfully that one has the sensation of real ascent although the gentle topography rises only slightly (fig. 8.36). Where the grade is depressed, as in the Valley of Fireflies, wood and earthen bridges or stone slab bridges ease the way (fig. 8.35).</p>
<p>The same hide-and-reveal tactics, which pleas-<lb/>
antly surprise with views that are unexpected, are employed within the house itself. One always approaches a house obliquely and, once inside, never approaches the main room axially, so that a view may be withheld until one comes upon it, perceiving it within a frame of <hi rend="italic">shoji</hi> (fig. 8.37). Elevated on a high foundation, the house loses connection with the ground plane; the sense of spatial interpenetration between interior and exterior is absent; and the framed garden views seem to be courtly paintings of nature, rather than the reality of nature apprehended at close range.</p>
<p>While the dreamworld of Katsura can be appre-<lb/>
ciated for its intrinsic qualities and without associa-<lb/>
tion, much of the scenery of this famous garden is probably based upon literary models, such as <name type="pname">Lady
<pb n="307"/>
<pb n="307" type="orig"/>
Murasaki</name>'s descriptions of Heian gardens in <hi rend="italic">The Tale of Genji</hi>. We may assume that, while <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name> may have advised <name type="pname">Prince Toshitada</name> from time to time, this great stroll garden, with its echoes of Heian beauty interwoven with rustic quietude, was the work of the scholarly prince himself, who, disenfranchised from affairs of state, found in the creation of Katsura a deeply engrossing pastime. In the <date when="1930">1930</date>s, Katsura was belatedly recognized by the Japanese as a national treasure. Preserved and maintained, it stands today as a monument to the prince and the triumph, in the long term, of art over the politics of power.</p>

<p>Kyoto boasts one other perfectly preserved imperial garden in the <hi rend="italic">kirei sabi</hi> style of <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name>: <name type="pname">Shuga-<lb/>
kuin Riky&#x016B;</name>. Here, in the scenic northeastern hills, an idyllic stroll garden with scattered tea houses incor-<lb/>
porates to an even greater degree than Katsura does, the design technique of <hi rend="italic">shakkei</hi>, or borrowed scenery. This landscape with its carefully wrought views beyond the limits of the garden was created under similar circumstances and at approximately the same time as Katsura by <name type="pname">Prince Toshitada</name>'s uncle, the retired emperor <name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name> (<date when="1596">1596</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680">1680</date>).</p>
<p>Angered by the shogun's heavy-handed super-<lb/>
vision of imperial affairs, <name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name> abruptly resigned in favor of his daughter in <date when="1629">1629</date>. Freed from ceremonial responsibility, he first turned his atten-<lb/>
tions to <name type="pname">Sent&#x014D; Gosho</name>, meaning "Retired Emperor's Villa," the palace and garden he planned with <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name>. After this project was completed, <name type="pname">Go-Mizu-<lb/>
noo</name> was ready to search for a site for a country retreat. This was undertaken with the encouragement of <name type="pname">Tokugawa Iemitsu</name>, who, in an effort to ingratiate himself with the imperial court in Kyoto and appease <name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name>'s smoldering frustrations, had increased his income more than threefold.</p>
<p>Thus furnished with a generous stipend, <name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name> selected a site of seventy-three acres in the beautiful Mount Hiei foothills, approximately 450 feet (137 meters) above sea level, near Shugakuin Temple, and there, by the early <date when="1650">1650</date>s, he was at work creating a landscape garden. <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name> was dead by this time, but like Henry Hoare, the owner-creator of Stourhead&#x2014;the English garden that is most simi-<lb/>
lar to Shugakuin&#x2014;<name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name> was a sufficient art-<lb/>
ist in his own right to apply the lessons of Ensh&#x016B; in a wholly original manner. Relying on the site's supe-<lb/>
rior inherent scenic potential, he created a design that is more relaxed and natural than that of Katsura.</p>
<p>Shugakuin now comprises three separate villa gardens. Placed at different elevations among ter-<lb/>
raced rice fields, these were connected by simple trails, replaced at the end of the nineteenth century by the tree-bordered gravel paths we find today. The gar-<lb/>
den surrounding the Lower Villa contains a small pond and three carved stone lanterns. The Middle Villa was used by one of <name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name>'s daughters as an abbess's residence when she became a nun in <date when="1680">1680</date> and founded a temple nearby. Its garden also contains a pond, as well as a lawn and a wide-spreading umbrella pine. But the full range of <name type="pname">Go-Mizunoo</name>'s genius is not apparent until one passes through culti-<lb/>
vated rice fields and ascends the slope to the Upper Villa.</p>

<p>The passage upward from the Imperial Gate, the point of entry to this part of Shugakuin, is a narrow set of stairs constricted by tall hedges on either side. It is only after emerging into the sunlight at the top of the slope that one sees the panorama of the lake, called Yokury&#x016B;-chi, or Bathing Dragon Pond, and the borrowed scenery of the gently undulating mountains to the northwest (fig. 8.38). The lake is supported by a massive terraced dam on its west bank, which is concealed by a long, flat-topped, stepped hedge com-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>Even here, where the technique of borrowed scenery reaches its consummate expression, the designer paid great attention to the texture of the ground plane. For instance, in front of the tea house at the <name type="pname">Senshi-dai</name>, or Poem-Washing Platform, built to offer the magnificent view, there is a paved apron embedded with stones set singly and in groups of two and three. It illustrates, like so many other design details, the casual-seeming, but carefully considered, artistry we have come to expect in Japanese gardens where almost nothing is left to chance (fig. 8.39).</p>
<p>A path descends from the hill of the Rin'un-tei to make a counterclockwise circuit around the lake. The lake was used for pleasure boating, and its islands, one of which has a small pavilion, could be visited. The bridges that connect them to one another and the shore are scenic elements in a series of continually shifting views as one continues around the lake (fig. 8.40). On the north shore, on the site of the present boathouse, stood the Shishi-sai, a summerhouse where guests might be carried upon arrival to refresh themselves before proceeding clockwise around the lake and up a circuitous path to the Rin'un-tei. Once arrived, they could enjoy, as a sudden surprise, the view of the sce-<lb/>
nic panorama that unfolds beyond the confines of the garden.</p>

<div type="subsection">

<p>Increasingly, garden design became less the realm of Zen priests and gifted aristocratic amateurs and more the province of professional gardeners, whose guiding influence remained <name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name>. <hi rend="italic">H&#x014D;j&#x014D;</hi> gardens (gar-<lb/>
dens designed in conjunction with the main building of a temple, often called the Abbot's Quarters) increased during the seventeenth century. This is due in part to the priest <name type="pname">Ishin-S&#x016B;den</name> (<date when="1564">1564</date>&#x2013;<date when="1632">1632</date>), who served as an intermediary between the <name type="pname">Tokugawa</name> shogunate and the temple administrators, securing support for the latter's construction projects. Often these were <hi rend="italic">kare sansui</hi>, or dry gardens, although they might contain rock arrange-<lb/>
ments, frequently ones suggesting the legendary crane or tortoise. The designs of these Edo period gardens were therefore less austere and ethereal than those of earlier Zen gardens such as Ry&#x014D;an-ji.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Kobori Ensh&#x016B;</name> himself designed the gardens at Konchi-in, a subtemple of Nanzen-ji where <name type="pname">Ishin-<lb/>
Suden</name> had his headquarters, after one of the fine build-<lb/>
ings from <name type="pname">Hideyoshi</name>'s Fushimi Castle in Kyoto was moved there in <date when="1611">1611</date>. His vigorous <hi rend="italic">kare sansui</hi> design employs rock arrangements that include crane and tor-<lb/>
toise imagery. In addition to its rock compositions and bed of raked white gravel, the garden of Konchi-in contains a backdrop of carefully pruned shrubs (fig. 8.41). Clipped shrubbery, the massive stepped hedge of Shugakuin, and the extraordinary continuously curving one at Daichi-ji&#x2014;an undulating, pulsating animal-like mass, which is the entire focus of the gar-<lb/>
den&#x2014;are additional hallmarks of Ensh&#x016B;'s boldly orig-<lb/>
inal style (fig. 8.42). The use of meticulously clipped shrubs, rather than rocks, as the principal elements in garden design is also found at Shisend&#x014D; (Hall of the Immortal Poets), the garden retreat built by <name type="pname">Ishikawa J&#x014D;zan</name> (<date when="1583">1583</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672">1672</date>), a <name type="pname">Tokugawa</name> dissident who retired here to a life of scholarship in <date when="1636">1636</date> (fig. 8.43). This garden contrasts with the lofty remoteness of the framed views seen from the interior of the <hi rend="italic">shoin</hi> at Katsura; at Konchi-in, interior and garden space inter-<lb/>
penetrate in delightful intimacy by way of the interme-<lb/>
diate space of the wooden veranda.</p>
<p>Other characteristic features of Edo period gar-<lb/>
dens are the sand mounds with surfaces raked by Jap-<lb/>
anese priests into abstract designs that anticipate by
<pb n="309"/>
<pb n="309" type="orig"/>
nearly four centuries the patterned landscape scari-<lb/>
fication one observes in the earth art of our own time. One enters H&#x00F4;nen-in, a temple of the J&#x014D;do sect of Buddhism, from a roofed gate that provides a plat-<lb/>
form for viewing a pair of mounds, the surfaces of which are raked with subtle delicacy. Nearby, at the Muromachi period villa-turned-temple garden of Ginkaku-ji, there is a pair of sand mounds dating from the Edo era. One of these takes the form of a truncated cone, thought to recall Mount Fuji or the central mountain of Buddhist myth, and the other, a horizontal rectangle, is known as the "Sea of Silver Sand" because its reflective white surface provided an added attraction during moon-viewing parties (fig. 8.44).</p>
<p>By the eighteenth century, the tradition of Jap-<lb/>
anese garden art was becoming devitalized. Many gardens were built, but their designers substituted a more formulaic approach for the deeply felt spiritual and aesthetic impulses that had nourished the tradi-<lb/>
tion in earlier times. The rise of <name type="place">Japan</name>'s prosperous merchant class created a large number of property owners, and this stimulated the demand for interior courtyard gardens. Nurseries and stone yards were established where plants, rocks, and lanterns could be purchased.</p>
<p>The appearance of the American naval com-<lb/>
mander <name type="pname">Commodore Perry</name> in <name type="place">Tokyo Bay</name> in <date when="1853">1853</date> brought about a decisive change in Japanese govern-<lb/>
ment and culture. Powerless in the face of this chal-<lb/>
lenge to <name type="place">Japan</name>'s long-standing isolationist policy, the <name type="pname">Tokugawa</name> shogunate, whose iron grip depended upon military might, was unable to maintain its con-<lb/>
trol. Thus ended two-and-a-half centuries of seclu-<lb/>
sion from the rest of the world. In <date when="1868">1868</date>, the emperor was restored to power and took up residence in Edo, which was renamed <name type="place">Tokyo</name>, meaning "Eastern Cap-<lb/>
ital." The Meiji Restoration&#x2014;the remolding of Jap-<lb/>
anese culture during the last half of the nineteenth century&#x2014;instituted constitutional government, did away with many complex rules of social stratifica-<lb/>

<p>Rapid Westernization transformed the Japa-<lb/>

But a more profound design integration of two such opposite traditions would necessarily await a later day when the modernist movement made the West ready to receive inspiration from the spare and elegant compositional devices found in Japanese gardens&#x2014;a sympathetic alliance with nature, bor-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>The designs of many of the landscapes studied thus far derive&#x2014; sometimes overtly, sometimes implicitly&#x2014;from cosmological beliefs. The desire to perceive order and meaning in the universe is pervasive throughout human history and continues to govern some of our most deep-seated psychological and religious attitudes. In the West, however, as the Scientific Revolution gained momentum through the eighteenth century and political revolutions discred-<lb/>
ited entrenched power structures, the impulse to reflect in land-<lb/>
scape terms a cosmological paradigm proclaiming divine order and elite authority diminished. As the theories of Newton were proved and extended by later scientific endeavor and became incorporated into the general cultural consciousness, intellectuals increasingly abandoned the quest for teleological meaning, concentrating instead on empirical explanations of the material world. Faith in reason and individual human action resulted in the substitution of personal judgment for blind obedience to authority, with signifi-<lb/>
cant political consequences as monarchies were toppled or their powers severely curtailed in favor of republican forms of govern-<lb/>
ment. For some people, faith in scientific progress displaced faith in supernatural powers and divine intervention in earthly affairs. For them, and for those who reconciled science with faith, the bet-<lb/>
terment of the conditions of life on Earth, not preparation for the hereafter, became the business of humankind.</p>
<p>Science assumed the authority previously enjoyed by religion and philosophy, which were demoted from their position as all-<lb/>
encompassing, culture-defining thought systems to being spiritual and intellectual disciplines. The unprecedented knowledge and technological results achieved by the Western pursuit of science, voyages of global exploration, and colonial expansion made Euro-<lb/>
peans, though arrogant in their presumption of world hegemony, at least more cognizant of other cultural perspectives. Travel also furthered the growing interest in natural science, and with the philo-<lb/>
sophical shift from teleology to scientific materialism, chemistry, biology, geology, and botany began to be pursued with the same fervor as the study of celestial bodies had been in former centuries when astrology was believed to govern human fate.</p>
<p>This pursuit of natural science had profound consequences for religion and philosophy, especially after Charles Darwin (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) published <hi rend="italic">The Origin of Species</hi> in <date when="1859">1859</date>. Galileo had long ago made it clear that Earth was no longer the center of the uni-<lb/>
verse, but it now became apparent that humans were products of an evolutionary biology that linked them with the rest of the ani-<lb/>
mal kingdom. Though bitterly resisted in some quarters, the same science that had caused human beings to modify their notions of their own nature and that of the cosmos also held the promise of untold material benefits.</p>
<p>But the power of people acting on their own behalf was often limited by their mistakes and misbegotten ideologies. In addition, humanity's growing power to control its destiny sometimes pro-<lb/>
duced results that were not necessarily beneficial to Earth or even humankind in the long term. Darwin's theories necessarily took into account geological time and a dynamics of Earth in which forces of crustal uplift and erosion shaped the land, which was con-<lb/>
tinually being recarved by wind, rain, and ice. Circumstances of geography and climate created ecological niches for species.<ref target="#CH9-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>Now, in the nineteenth century, it became apparent to a few that the human species was capable of destroying other species and limit-<lb/>
ing its own future welfare as it continued to modify the environ-<lb/>
ment by felling trees and clearing land for agriculture. This removal of native vegetation destroyed natural drainage systems, acceler-<lb/>
ated erosion, and altered climate.</p>
<p><name type="pname">George Perkins Marsh</name> (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>), American diplomat and early environmentalist, wrote <hi rend="italic">Man and Nature</hi> (<date when="1864">1864</date>) as a stern warning against this calamitous course of unchecked abuse of nature. Just as Darwin's theories made some people revise their understanding of the Biblical creation story and regard it as myth
<pb n="312"/>
<pb n="312" type="orig"/>
and metaphor instead of gospel, so Marsh's views made unwork-<lb/>
able the notion of the Creator making Earth solely for humanity's exploitation. For Western Christian societies, to look at landscape in ecological and conservationist terms as Marsh did was to ques-<lb/>
tion the wisdom of the scriptural injunction in Genesis 1:28 to "fill the earth and subdue it." Dominion without enlightened husbandry, according to Marsh, spelled destruction.</p>
<p>The difficulty that practicing Christians and Jews in the nine-<lb/>
teenth century had reconciling their beliefs with the challenging new theories of science and humanity's role as God's partner and steward of Earth rather than His mere ward should not be mini-<lb/>
mized. Intellectually and morally, the late eighteenth century had in the nations of the West consolidated the Scientific Revolution that had begun in the sixteenth, while at the same time giving birth to the Industrial Revolution. Now, in the nineteenth century, the unsettling vision Goethe had limned in <hi rend="italic">Faust Part II</hi> of nature over-<lb/>
mastered by humanity in the form of the engineer and the devel-<lb/>
oper was becoming a palpable reality. Romantics, following Rousseau and Wordsworth, found in wild nature the scenery of the sublime, a source of spiritual solace no longer available to those who had begun to question the premises of inherited religion. At the same time, the longing for the promise of redemptive salv-<lb/>
ation offered the faithful in earlier Christian centuries continued, and churchgoing remained a strongly rooted social convention and reli-<lb/>
gious belief a personal need and cultural habit for many in the West.</p>
<p>The English writer and pioneer art critic John Ruskin (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) promoted an aesthetics that was rooted in the study of nature, which he equated with Truth. By preaching a philoso-<lb/>
phy of Beauty with the same fervor as ministers of the Evangelical tradition in which he had been raised, Ruskin furthered the mod-<lb/>
ern notion that the appreciation and practice of art could serve as a source of spiritual life rather than simply as a manifestation of it. Like others of his generation, Ruskin was appalled by the dehu-<lb/>
manization he perceived to be a result of industrial capitalism's advance, and he sought to revive the artisanship associated with the medieval period, a time when craft guilds flourished and Gothic stone carvers' close observation of nature resulted in a vigorously vital style of ornamentation. The American writers Ralph Waldo Emerson (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) and Henry David Thoreau (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">1862</date>) met science's challenge to religion with transcendentalism, the literary and philosophical movement that advocated intuition as a mode of perception transcending empiricism.</p>
<p>Whether reacting against or incorporating the implications of modern science and Darwinism, few in the nineteenth century reck-<lb/>
oned that further blows to humanity's self-esteem and relationship with past tradition had yet to be assimilated. But the insights of Friedrich Nietzsche (<date when="1844">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) and Sigmund Freud (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1939">1939</date>) established the intellectual climate of much of the twentieth cen-<lb/>
tury, a radical modernity in which people no longer looked to past traditions for inspiration and a sense of continuity with history; instead, they looked to the present and future as the only reliable basis for knowledge and human advancement. Even those who remained religious in outlook increasingly considered themselves their own best earthly guides. Humanitarian social consciousness thus pervaded Western ideology, and utopian schemes flourished. This, abetted by widespread religious skepticism and atheism, helped create a cultural climate that gradually became receptive to, and more tolerant of, religious and social pluralism.</p>
<p>The consequences for landscape within the secular, highly energetic, increasingly cosmopolitan framework of nineteenth-<lb/>
century Western culture were enormous. In terms of landscape history, the public parks movement is a signal contribution of the nineteenth century to modern urbanism. As more purely aesthetic values supplanted ideological ones in landscape design, the eighteenth-century Picturesque idiom remained viable for the cre-<lb/>
ation of nineteenth-century parks and gardens. Many aristocrats destroyed the geometrical gardens of their ancestral seats as the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> continued to be popular throughout nineteenth-<lb/>
century Europe, an emblem of the social progressiveness of their owners. At the same time, theorists and practitioners adopted a more catholic approach to landscape aesthetics, and the doctrinal fervor and invective that had characterized the design disputes of the eighteenth century were replaced by an eclecticism in which individual taste was given increasingly broad license. History as a cultural value in its own right and an intellectual framework for preserving and imitating past styles replaced commitment to a sin-<lb/>
gle style reflecting a consensual ideology. Geometrical design was allowed back into English gardens, and the display of exotic plant material became a mark of the Victorian style called <hi rend="italic">Gardenesque.</hi></p>
<p>From our own historical vantage point, the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury's faith in scientific progress and planning as a means toward utopian human fulfillment seems overconfident, a heady and over-<lb/>
weening attitude that produced unforeseen consequences. The hypocrisies and inequalities of this extraordinary age are all too glaring. Although the Industrial Revolution fostered capitalist economies in the West, which produced a broad middle class and brought a cornucopia of goods and comforts to many, it was wrenching for others, causing large-scale migrations that tore peo-<lb/>
ple away from their homes and homelands. Those dispossessed from an immediate connection with landscapes of important sen-<lb/>
timental and psychological value often endured, in addition, squalid living conditions in rapidly growing cities. Republican governments proved no more immune to corruption and class distinctions than those based upon aristocratic privilege and social hierarchy. Colo-<lb/>
nialism, which reached its zenith in the nineteenth century, was generally callous in its disregard of native cultural values, attempt-<lb/>
ing to establish Western mores as universal while relegating non-<lb/>
European races to inferior status. Even after it became a sovereign nation, the United States accomplished the settlement of its conti-<lb/>
nental territory under a similar cultural imperative.</p>
<p>At the same time, this period in Western history demon-<lb/>
strated the benefits of science as the foundations for modern med-<lb/>
icine were laid, public sanitation victories achieved, better living conditions established, and faster means of transportation and com-<lb/>
munication developed. Scientific technology fostered an abundance of new inventions, constantly improving the processes of indus-<lb/>
trial production and accelerating its pace, making goods cheap and readily available. The potential danger to all human life consequent
<pb n="313"/>
<pb n="313" type="orig"/>
upon the splitting of the atom and widespread industrial degrada-<lb/>
tion of the environment still lay in the future. In the nineteenth century, the energies of humanitarian reformers were focused on the unprecedented problems that attended the birth of mass soci-<lb/>
ety rather than on such global issues as these. Cholera, caused by contaminated drinking water, and other illnesses were associated with overcrowding. The use of industrial technology to build aque-<lb/>
ducts, sewers, and other important elements of a new urban infra-<lb/>
structure was essential if populations were to survive in cities grown to a metropolitan scale. Further, parks and transportation lines con-<lb/>
necting the commercial center with outlying residential suburbs needed to be built in order to maintain contact with nature other-<lb/>
wise lost to large-scale urban growth. The new immigrants pour-<lb/>
ing into cities in search of better lives posed special problems in terms of housing, education, and medical services. Responses to their suffering illuminated religion's revised role for many as an eth-<lb/>
ical, rather than a metaphysical, system.</p>
<p>Industrial capitalism and humane practicality went hand-in-<lb/>
hand. Jeremy Bentham (<date when="1748">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>) and James Mill (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836">1836</date>) enunciated the doctrine of utilitarianism, the ethical theory that sees utility as a measure of economic and social value, directing all action toward the goal of achieving the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Imbued with democratic principles and utilitarian concepts of social justice, civic and political leaders under-<lb/>
took prison and burial reform, established public education, and created cultural institutions and large municipal parks for the social improvement and recreation of the population at large.</p>
<p>The creation of public parks and rural cemeteries were linked nineteenth-century phenomena. The rise in the numbers of dead in growing municipalities forced speedy disinterment of bodies in order to make room for new burials. Sectarian minorities without burial grounds advocated nondenominational public cemeteries. They were joined by sanitary reformers who saw urban church-<lb/>
yards as a source of groundwater contamination, fostering the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases. P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise Cemetery in <name type="place">Paris</name>, established in <date when="1804">1804</date>, became an international model for municipal cemeteries elsewhere. In <name type="place">America</name>, the first public cemeteries, <name type="place">Boston</name>'s Mount Auburn and <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>'s Green-<lb/>
Wood, served the function of public pleasure grounds in advance of the establishment of public parks, and their popularity did much to promote the municipal parks movement.</p>
<p>Within a repertoire of inherited design idioms featuring geo-<lb/>
metric, Picturesque, and gridiron layouts, which they often employed in combination, nineteenth-century designers strove to incorporate the newly discovered plants made available through expeditions of botanical discovery and the establishment of commercial nurseries. Through the publication of books and journals and as designers, such horticultural and landscape writers, editors, and practitioners as the Scot John Claudius Loudon (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>) and the American Andrew Jackson Downing (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>) democratized culture. They accomplished this by showing the aspiring members of the newly wealthy middle class how to attain the trappings of gentility, includ-<lb/>
ing homes and gardens similar, although on a smaller scale, to those of the aristocracy. The operative word in their works was <hi rend="italic">taste,</hi> a dis-<lb/>
cerning sense of what was excellent, harmonious, and beautiful&#x2014; the quality that gave gentility visible form.</p>
<p>Increasingly, as living standards rose, commercial nurseries catering to the needs of the head gardeners on large estates were also able to bring horticulture within reach of other social strata. With the growth in home ownership, domesticity became a sig-<lb/>
nificant cultural value. The ornamental garden assumed new importance as an adjunct to the house, and even the humble cot-<lb/>
tage garden came to be regarded as an aesthetic object, rather than simply a utilitarian one. On great estates, owners ceased to remove cottages and sometimes whole villages, previously thought to blight the view of naturalistically arranged scenery. Increasingly toward the end of his career, Repton had found room for vernacular archi-<lb/>
tecture in his designs, and Loudon now displayed the conscience of the times by illustrating his text on agrarian structures with sketches of cottages that provided both warmth and comfort for those who dwelt within and scenic charm for those who viewed them from without.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century signaled the separation of living space from the workplace as cottage manufacturing was replaced by industrial production in large factories. The middle-class interest in the private realm of house and garden could not have occurred without new, efficient means of public transportation after the invention of macadam paving and the railroad steam engine. These made possible the creation of residential suburbs, and landscape planners exploited this opportunity with considerable ingenuity. As the nineteenth-century metropolis became a regional-scale munic-<lb/>
ipality, it encompassed its former rural environs, thereby accom-<lb/>
plishing the ultimate ungirdling of cities and the final removal of old fortification walls.</p>
<p>Encouraged by <name type="pname">Mill</name>, <name type="pname">Bentham</name>, and the generally enterpri-<lb/>
sing and practical temper of the times, people in the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury were disposed to admire utility. Although conservatives such as Ruskin found the new industrial building materials hideous, oth-<lb/>
ers equated the useful with the beautiful. While there was debate about the siting of the new-style conservatory at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew within the principal line of view, the technologi-<lb/>
cal ingenuity of its architecture was in fact a source of pride, and its immediate popularity justified its conspicuous location (see fig. 9.4). People soon attuned their eyes to the novel form and materials of such great glass structures, engineered to span unprecedented widths, and they became architectural icons of the age, employed in the construction of railroad stations and in the Crystal Palace of the Great Exposition held in <name type="place">London</name> in <date when="1851">1851</date>, followed by one built in <name type="place">New York</name> City two years later.</p>
<p>In other ways, technology played an important role in land-<lb/>
scape design. The lawn mower was patented by Edwin Budding in <date when="1830">1830</date>. This efficient machine made possible a landscape aesthetic that put a premium upon the smooth, evenly sheared lawn as scythe mowing was abandoned (see fig. 9.6). The coming of railroads not only created the planned suburb, but brought quickly and cheaply nonlocal building materials and horticultural plants to urban cen-<lb/>
ters. Innovations multiplied as inventors took out patents on a host of new materials: portland cement, asphalt paving, the wrought-<lb/>
<pb n="314"/>
<pb n="314" type="orig"/>
iron sash bar for conservatory panes, sheet glass. Cast-iron con-<lb/>
struction, the revival of terra-cotta casting, and the manufacture of encaustic tiles increased the range of opportunity for ornamental expression. Steam, hot-water, and eventually gas heating systems provided comfort and convenience to people and protected tender plants. Applications of technology to the built environment had important effects on landscape design and the appearance of cities.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the garden became the laboratory of horticul-<lb/>
tural science. Not only were exotic species displayed as choice spec-<lb/>
imens of garden art, but also grafting, training, and hybridization produced plants in new forms, shapes, and colors. Competitive exhi-<lb/>
bitions such as the Chiswick Show were organized to judge their merits. Commercial nurseries thrived as botanical interest became widespread.</p>
<p>Garden encyclopedias replaced treatises on aesthetics. Numer-<lb/>
ous periodicals sprang up to serve an audience eager for advice on the practical aspects of landscape design and infor\mation about the latest developments in botany and horticulture. Horticultural soci-<lb/>
eties, botanical gardens, and certain wealthy persons continued to send plant explorers to remote parts of the globe in search of uncat-<lb/>
alogued species. Botanical illustration reached its apogee as an art form, and many beautiful colored engravings by such talented artists as <name type="pname">Pierre-Joseph Redout&#x00E9;</name> (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841">1841</date>), <name type="pname">Francis Bauer</name> (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840">1840</date>) and <name type="pname">Ferdinand Bauer</name> (<date when="1760">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), and <name type="pname">James Sowerby</name> (<date when="1757">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">1822</date>) were reproduced in the proliferating horticultural mag-<lb/>
azines (see fig. 9.1). Some of their names&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden, Botanical Magazine or Flower-Garden Displayed, Gardeners' Magazine of Botany, Paxton's Magazine of Botany and Register of Flowering Plants, Horticultural Journal and Florists' Register of Useful Information Con-<lb/>
nected with Floriculture, The Floricultural Cabinet, Florists'Magazine</hi>&#x2014; suggest the nineteenth century's fascination with flowers newly available to gardeners through the efforts of ingenious hybridizers and intrepid explorers.</p>
<p>The competition among these periodicals in a time when lit-<lb/>
erary piracy and plagiarism were common generated considerable editorial invective. The passions that ran high in their pages were symptomatic of an intense and broadening interest in horticulture and landscape design. In <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Magazine, and Register of Rural and Domestic Improvement,</hi> the earliest general horticultural publi-<lb/>
cation, Loudon forthrightly delivered his candid opinions between <date when="1826">1826</date> and <date when="1844">1844</date>. As we shall see in Chapter Eleven, by the end of the century, after the Victorian garden had incorporated the botanical riches of the age, new design wars erupted in <name type="place">England</name>, pitting advo-<lb/>
cates of informal impressionistic arrangement of herbaceous bor-<lb/>
ders, such as the horticultural writer and editor William Robinson and the Arts and Crafts gardener, photographer, and author Gertrude Jekyll, against those who practiced "bedding out," the arrangement of plants according to precise patterns for seasonal display. At the same time, Sir Reginald Blomfield championed Ital-<lb/>
ianate geometrical style in <hi rend="italic">The Formal Garden in <name type="place">England</name></hi> (<date when="1892">1892</date>), fiercely opposing Robinson's naturalistic approach. Thus was the debate between Art and Nature once again joined within the con-<lb/>
text of landscape design.</p>
<p>The rapidly industrializing cities of the northeastern United States looked to <name type="place">England</name> for landscape design models at the same time as the American frontier was being pushed westward. The street grid proved the most practical means for parceling and con-<lb/>
veying real estate in new cities, but preceptors such as <name type="pname">Andrew Jack-<lb/>
son Downing</name>, who instructed the growing middle class in the principles of horticultural management and Picturesque landscape design, began to pose an alternative. Downing gave the term <hi rend="italic">rural</hi> new meaning by creating a middle landscape of suburban "villa" and cottage architecture&#x2014;a built landscape that was neither wholly agrarian nor wholly urban.</p>
<p>Frederick Law Olmsted (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903">1903</date>), in partnership with the English-born architect Calvert Vaux (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">1895</date>), directed the Pic-<lb/>
turesque idiom toward democratic ends in creating America's first public parks. The parks that Olmsted and Vaux designed, first in <name type="place">New York</name> and then in other cities, were mostly naturalistic essays in which they replicated rural and wilderness scenery in order to create a poetic mood that would lift the spirits of careworn city dwellers. Olmsted and Vaux also became the country's first urban planners on a metropolitan scale, conceiving of parkways as a means of linking parks together into a citywide system and pro-<lb/>
viding carriage drives to America's first suburbs. The curvilinear layout of the suburbs they designed posed a Picturesque alterna-<lb/>
tive to the grid, heretofore the standard plan for new streets. Still other forces at the end of the nineteenth century set the country on a different course, as the designers for a Gilded Age imitated the historic architecture and planning forms of Renaissance and sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century <name type="place">France</name> and <name type="place">Italy</name>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Indefatigable</hi> and <hi rend="italic">industrious</hi> are adjectives often connected with the names of many nineteenth-century figures. Herculean were the labors of those who created the botanical gardens and other scientific and cultural institutions, meticulously recorded the observations of their difficult voyages to distant parts, built the parks and park systems that we still enjoy, and conceived and built the transportation and sanitary engineering infrastructure to sup-<lb/>
port large cities&#x2014;all the while corresponding voluminously and publishing profusely without the convenience of present-day com-<lb/>
munications technology. Our chronicle of the period begins with a discussion of the careers of several important figures who per-<lb/>
sonify the human energy that flourished spectacularly at this time.</p>

<p>Eighteenth-century Enlightenment science opened the door to the passionate pursuit of natural history in the nineteenth century. The real "discovery" of <name type="place">America</name> had been the discovery by Europeans of unbounded economic opportunity, a good deal of which was based at first on a single plant, tobacco. A happy bonus had been the introduction to botanical science of a wealth of hitherto unknown ornamental species. The plant exchanges that occurred first in the colonial era and then in the federal period prepared the way for the explosion of horticultural activity in the nineteenth century. The taxonomic classification system developed by Linnaeus, in which Latin pro-<lb/>
vided a universal language of binomial references for individual plant species, made it possible for members of a growing international scientific community to develop a common knowledge base and communi-<lb/>
cate intelligibly with one another.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew</hi></hi></head>
<p>At the center of much of this botanical activity and forming the bridge between the eighteenth and nine-<lb/>
teenth centuries stood Sir Joseph Banks (<date when="1743">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">1820</date>), the president of the Royal Society from <date when="1778">1778</date> until his death and, as botanical advisor to George III, de facto director of the Royal Gardens at Kew. Wealthy, polit-<lb/>
ically well-connected, and with three years of experi-<lb/>
ence collecting plants on the <hi rend="italic">Endeavour</hi> voyage as credentials for projects of this nature, Banks was able to attract royal and aristocratic patronage for natu-<lb/>
ralists attached to ships bound for distant lands. He assessed the professional skills and industriousness of young men in training at Kew, and from their ranks selected candidates such as Allan Cunningham and James Bowie for the arduous work of plant hunting in the wilds of South Africa, <name type="place">Australia</name>, the Americas, and China. Banks enjoined these and other explorers to keep journals recording the climatic conditions and soil quality of native plant habitats. The greatest dif-<lb/>
ficulty occurred in transporting seeds and specimens on long ocean voyages where cold, mildew, sea spray, vermin, and natural disaster took a significant toll.</p>
<p>It was not until <date when="1838">1838</date> that <name type="pname">Nathaniel Ward</name> (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>) of <name type="place">London</name>, a doctor and naturalist, stum-<lb/>
bled upon an invention that proved of great utility to future plant collectors. After burying a chrysalis in soil placed in the bottom of a covered glass jar, he soon discovered that the seeds in the soil began to germi-<lb/>
nate because condensation produced by plant respi-<lb/>
ration within the jar created a moist, self-sustaining environment. He published his discovery in a treatise titled <hi rend="italic">On the Growth of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases</hi> (<date when="1842">1842</date>), and the Wardian case&#x2014;in effect a miniature greenhouse&#x2014;soon became part of the standard equipment of all plant hunters. Meanwhile, collec-<lb/>
tors in the field, whose passage and pay were funded by the Horticultural Society of <name type="place">London</name>&#x2014;founded in <date when="1804">1804</date> to advance botanical science and garner foreign plant material for English gardens&#x2014;ingeniously devised new methods and materials for packing their precious cargoes, albeit with statistically disappoint-<lb/>
ing results. Nevertheless, enough plants survived, and <name type="place">England</name>'s ambitions as a colonial power assured con-<lb/>
tinuing opportunities for botanists to attach them-<lb/>
selves to vessels bound for exotic locales. To Banks belongs credit for establishing the eminence of the Royal Gardens at Kew as a repository for dried spec-<lb/>
imens and botanical data, a center for the global trans-<lb/>
fer of plant material, and the imperial nexus of a growing number of colonial botanical gardens.</p>
<p><name type="pname">William Townsend Aiton</name> (<date when="1766">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>), the superintendent of Kew after <date when="1793">1793</date> and one of the founders of the Horticultural Society of <name type="place">London</name> (later the Royal Horticultural Society), assisted Banks in ensuring that specimens of plants collected from various sources were sent to Kew. Banks's visionary leadership, combined with his ardent imperialism, set the agenda. He requested diplomats, army and navy officers, captains of merchant vessels, foreign mis-<lb/>
sionaries, and colonial correspondents to foster Kew's botanical collections. As a result, in <date when="1789">1789</date>, Aiton pub-<lb/>
lished <hi rend="italic">Hortus Kewensis,</hi> a three-volume catalogue of the plants at Kew, prepared with the help of <name type="pname">Daniel Solander</name>, a former pupil of <name type="pname">Linnaeus</name>, and <name type="pname">Jonas Dryander</name>, another professional botanist from <name type="place">Swe-<lb/>

<p>By the <date when="1820">1820</date>s, Kew's preeminence was being eclipsed by more progressive and active botanical organizations, notably the Horticultural Society of <name type="place">London</name>, which in that decade was sponsoring plant-<lb/>
collecting expeditions to <name type="place">China</name>, <name type="place">Africa</name>, <name type="place">Mexico</name>, parts of <name type="place">South America</name>, and the Pacific coast of the United States. As botanical gardens proliferated at universi-<lb/>

Visitors noticed its decline, and <name type="pname">John Claudius Loudon</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Magazine</hi> commented with asperity on the situation. However, in <date when="1841">1841</date>, the British Treasury assumed support of Kew, renaming it the Royal Botanic Gardens. <name type="pname">William Jackson</name>

<name type="pname">Hooker</name> (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">1865</date>) was appointed director. By then, Loudon had traveled extensively, visited botanical gar-<lb/>
dens in <name type="place">England</name> and abroad, and was well established as the country's leading spokesperson on horticulture. His remarkable career as a scientific farmer, landscape gardener, inventor, writer, and editor epitomizes the creative energy, scientific appetite, technological apti-<lb/>

scale terms. He was in effect a metropolitan planner several decades before <name type="place">London</name> and other British cities were organized governmentally to accept this kind of vision. An admirer of Thomas Jefferson whose term <hi rend="italic">self-government</hi> he borrowed upon occasion, he looked forward to the day when public improvements were undertaken by general consensus and in a compre-<lb/>
hensive and rational manner, not piecemeal at the behest of the wealthy and powerful. He felt that tun-<lb/>
nels, bridges, and other works of utilitarian engineer-<lb/>
ing were nobler monuments to a society's genius than the grandest examples of purely heroic architecture and sculpture. Sanitary engineering and the conquest of distance by rail transport excited his imagination as he dreamed of livable cities and the measures that would enable the worker to be more conveniently united with a job and the middle-class homeowner with a plot of suburban greenery. He had the idea of shaping metropolitan growth and relieving congestion with a series of concentric greenbelts long before <name type="pname">Ebenezer Howard</name> (<date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1928">1928</date>) and subsequent plan-<lb/>
ners proposed this type of controlled urbanism.</p>
<p>Loudon, the eldest son of a Scottish farmer, arrived in <name type="place">London</name> in <date when="1803">1803</date> at the age of twenty, well educated and with practical experience in hothouse design and embankment construction for land recla-<lb/>
mation. A letter of introduction from a former pro-<lb/>
fessor introduced him to Sir Joseph Banks, who generously befriended him. He also became acquainted with the botanical artist <name type="pname">James Sowerby</name> and with <name type="pname">Jeremy Bentham</name>, whose theory of utilitari-<lb/>
anism and whose ideological range and systematic intellectual approach had a lasting influence upon him.</p>
<p>Loudon's first literary effort in <name type="place">London</name> was a proposal to apply Picturesque principles to the plant-<lb/>
ing of hardy trees and flowering shrubs within the city's squares. He followed this essay with <hi rend="italic">Observa-<lb/>
tions on Landscape Gardening</hi> (<date when="1804">1804</date>), which helped him attract clients seeking his professional advice. Between <date when="1808">1808</date> and <date when="1811">1811</date>, he resided at Tew Lodge Farm, Oxfordshire, where, in addition to proving to the landowner and his client, General <name type="pname">George Frederick Stratton</name>, the profitability of a new system of lease-<lb/>
hold arrangements, Loudon directed numerous improvements paid for by the general, aspiring here to create <name type="place">England</name>'s premier <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e.</hi> He removed some hedgerows in order to plant new ones as shel-<lb/>
ters against the prevailing winds, had rough fields regraded and installed with drains, and built a farm-<lb/>
house in an innovative design that emphasized prac-<lb/>
ticality, comfort, and technology over ornament and style; yet he made these elements of economy and convenience compatible with elegance and refine-<lb/>
ment (fig. 9.2). His farm roads followed the contours of the land in a Picturesque manner, and around his new house he planted shrubs and trees in irregular masses, once again according to the system of Jussieu. Although he did not coin the term <hi rend="italic">Gardenesque</hi> until twenty years later, here he put into practice the prin-<lb/>
ciples of his later definition by incorporating exotic species into his landscape design and displaying all plants, whether foreign or native, in such a way that each could reveal itself to advantage. Botanical dis-<lb/>
play was a central focus for Loudon, and his intention at Tew Lodge Farm and elsewhere was to acknowl-<lb/>
edge landscape as nature, art, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> science.</p>
<p>From the beginning of his career, Loudon saw education as one of his missions. At Tew Lodge Farm he established an agricultural college to teach the sons of the landed gentry and prospective estate agents his new methods of scientific farming. Moreover, he was progressive in his concern for farm laborers, paying particular attention to the quality of their housing and food. But being not yet thirty, Loudon was more inter-<lb/>
ested in demonstrating a successful experiment than in settling permanently at Tew Lodge Farm. However
<pb n="317"/>
<pb n="317" type="orig"/>
challenging the life of a scientific farmer and educa-<lb/>
tor might have been, his phenomenal energies and intellectual curiosity required a larger sphere of activ-<lb/>
ity. After two and a half years, when General Stratton offered to buy back his lease, Loudon accepted.</p>

<p>With the Napoleonic wars in Europe drawing to a close, he now seized the opportunity to travel abroad, journeying across northern Europe during a nineteen-month period in <date when="1813">1813</date> and <date when="1814">1814</date>. Letters of introduction from <name type="pname">Sir Joseph</name> Banks gained him access to aristocratic estates and professional societies where his knowledge of French, German, and Italian made it possible for him to speak fluently with head gar-<lb/>
deners, architects, and others. In Russia, he was impressed with the pineapples, cherries, peaches, plums, apples, pears, and grapes that were being grown under glass on noblemen's estates. It was with a technical eye that he studied the construction of greenhouses or remarked on the heat-retention capa-<lb/>
bilities of the Russian stove. These observations served him well when, upon returning to <name type="place">London</name>, he turned his thoughts toward an examination of how the construction of greenhouses could be improved through technology.</p>
<p>In this effort he was not alone. In <date when="1812">1812</date>, <name type="pname">Thomas Andrew Knight</name> (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838">1838</date>), the younger brother of <name type="pname">Richard Payne Knight</name> and a member of the Horti-<lb/>
cultural Society of <name type="place">London</name>, published a paper in which he suggested that a purely functional hothouse in which the greatest amount of light could be admit-<lb/>
ted through the least expanse of glass, one that in addition could be efficiently heated, would offer hor-<lb/>
ticultural and economic advantages over hothouses designed in the conventional manner. Conservatories at this time were still being designed in the tradition represented by Chambers's Orangery at Kew, with large arched windows set into masonry walls. Exper-<lb/>
imenting with different shapes and structural tech-<lb/>
niques in his Bayswater garden, in <date when="1816">1816</date> Loudon invented a curvilinear sash bar of wrought iron. His experiments also led him to propose a "ridge and fur-<lb/>
row," or double-meridian, glazing system in which the glass panes of the conservatory were angled so as best to catch morning and afternoon light while pre-<lb/>
venting the scorching of leaves by the direct rays ot the noonday sun. He also conceived a "polyprosopic design of hinged surfaces that could be adjusted by chains and pulleys in the manner of Venetian blinds to gain a more desirable angle in relation to the sun or to let in fresh air and summer rain showers (fig. 9.3). As curved-glass conservatories for tender plants became common on estates after the lifting of the British tax on glass in <date when="1845">1845</date>, their juxtaposition with the eclectic neotraditional architecture of the Victo-<lb/>
rian mansion was sometimes ridiculed, but following Loudon (see fig. 9.2), these popular status symbols were given pride of place in Victorian landscaping schemes.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Joseph Paxton</name>'s ridge-and-furrow-style conser-<lb/>

neering work in glasshouse construction (fig. 9.4). Now Loudon's fertile genius, excited by technology, projected other innovations as well, including schemes for industrial workers' housing and a solar heating system, which he published in <date when="1822">1822</date> in his comprehensive, detailed, and well-organized <hi rend="italic">Ency-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>In all these works he combined an ardent humanitarian interest in improved working condi-<lb/>
tions and educational opportunities for gardeners with matters of scientific and technological interest, practical horticultural advice, aesthetic theories, and critical descriptions of gardens, which he visited reg-<lb/>
ularly on his travels through <name type="place">England</name> and Europe. His audience consisted of <name type="pname">Oxford</name> and <name type="place">Cambridge</name> dons, country vicars, doctors, directors of botanical gar-<lb/>
dens, architects, engineers, landscape designers, and head gardeners on the estates of the nobility. Lords and ladies read his works, too, as did, he hoped, his target audience: young gardeners who, not being able to afford the two-shilling cost of a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Gar-<lb/>
dener's Magazine,</hi> had to borrow it.</p>
<p>Although as a young man eager to establish his own reputation, Loudon had taken issue with some of the design principles of the doyen of landscape gar-<lb/>
deners, Humphry Repton, in <date when="1840">1840</date> he served as the editor of a new edition of Repton's collected works. Loudon realized, as had Repton, that publication was a surer route to far-reaching professional influence than commissions to landscape the properties of the wealthy But commissions, especially those that served a public interest, were an important means of demon-<lb/>
strating the principles and practices he advocated in his books and magazines. He was therefore delighted to be summoned to the industrial town of Derby in the spring of <date when="1839">1839</date> to lay out an 11-acre arboretum, the gift to the town from its former mayor, <name type="pname">Joseph Strutt</name>. Here, in the smoky Midlands, thanks to Strutt's philanthropy, Loudon had an opportunity to demon-<lb/>
strate his belief that a landscape containing the most beautiful specimens of nature could edify the general populace, relieve the misery of the working poor, and produce among the mingled classes sentiments of mutual respect and civic pride.</p>
<p>Although Loudon had integrated the awk-<lb/>
wardly shaped parcel with an efficient circulation sys-<lb/>
tem, concealed its boundaries with dense planting, and made less apparent its cramped dimensions with a series of linear mounds that focused the view on the immediate surroundings and screened people and objects elsewhere on the grounds, as a design, the Derby Arboretum drew mixed reviews (fig. 9.5). But as a social experiment, it was an unqualified success. Three days of public revels attended its opening, and according to contemporary reports not a single plant was harmed. It remained a popular attraction, draw-<lb/>
ing on Sundays throngs of working-class people, some of whom traveled in the third-class railway car-<lb/>
riages from as far away as Sheffield, Birmingham, and Leeds. When they arrived, they could refresh them-<lb/>
selves at the entry lodge, where there were toilet facil-<lb/>
ities and hot water for tea. Then they were free to stroll along serpentine paths, admiring the shrubs and trees arranged according to the Jussieu system,<ref target="#CH9-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>which were identified by labels giving botanical and com-<lb/>
<pb n="319"/>
<pb n="319" type="orig"/>
mon names, country of origin, mature height, and the date of introduction into Britain. Loudon also had the specimens of the Derby Arboretum numbered, and these numbers were keyed to information in a pamphlet he produced containing much scientific and anecdotal information, which visitors could purchase at the lodge. Those who preferred simple relaxation to botanical edification could walk on one of the two broad, straight gravel paths that constituted the Arboretum's cross axis. Pavilions at the ends of the crosswalks provided shade or shelter from a shower. Benches, with footboards as an accommodation to the aged and infirm, offered seating along the paths. Altogether, the Derby Arboretum was an impressive and progressive accomplishment in <date when="1840">1840</date>, a forerunner of the work of Joseph Paxton, Frederick Law Olm-<lb/>
sted, and other later park builders.</p>
<p>Loudon's marriage at the age of forty-seven to Jane Webb (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>) was rewarding for both part-<lb/>
ners. Her kind spirit and literary abilities were tested to the utmost as she set about helping him write and publish his lifework, the handsomely illustrated, vast, and taxing <hi rend="italic">Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum.</hi> Later, as a widow, she undertook to pay off the remaining debt that this immense and costly endeavor had imposed on them. Her reward was pride in his place in history and lasting renown in her own right. Loudon, who advocated the pursuit of horticulture by women, had encouraged her activities as a practical gardener as well as a writer, and she was instrumental in turning other women's time and physical energies to this healthful employment. Her <hi rend="italic">Gardening for Ladies</hi> ran to several editions and was edited for American publication by Andrew Jackson Downing. With her last book, <hi rend="italic">My Own Garden; or The Young Gardener's Year Book</hi> (<date when="1855">1855</date>), she introduced children to the pleasures that she and Loudon had shared with their daughter Agnes or observed on their travels as a family.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Victorian Garden</hi></hi></head>
<p>Under the influence of the Loudons, the Victorian garden perpetuated the Picturesque tradition while also displaying the results of botanical science. Com-<lb/>
bined with expression of the Romantic spirit of the age was a bent toward practicality and desire to employ industrial materials that anticipated the func-<lb/>
tional landscape aesthetic of twentieth-century mod-<lb/>
ernism (see Chapter Thirteen). But unlike modernist designers who sought to elevate functionalism to the status of aesthetic principle, Victorian landscape gar-<lb/>
deners were unreservedly eclectic. They cloaked their functionalism in period costume&#x2014;"the Styles that Le Corbusier as a polemical modernist would famously rail against. The search for cultural coher-<lb/>
ence where none could be found in the face of soci-<lb/>
ety's growing secularism and rapid technological change fostered this historicism. People who cared about such things looked nostalgically to the archi-<lb/>
tectural vocabularies of other times and places as embodiments of various truer meanings than what they believed existed in nineteenth-century <name type="place">England</name>. Followers of John Ruskin, for instance, developed the Victorian Gothic style with its evocation of medieval Christian values. Other Victorians, ambitious for Britain's growing imperial power, favored Neoclassi-<lb/>
cal design idioms based on French and Italian models as appropriate means of advertising wealth and sta-<lb/>
tus. Imitations of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> beds found in seven-<lb/>
teenth-century <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi> gardens proved admirably suited to their lavish, patterned floral displays.</p>
<p>Even such a prominent practitioner of the Pic-<lb/>
turesque as Repton modified his style at the end of his career to reflect a greater tolerance for period ele-<lb/>
ments, such as terraces with balustrades. With prac-<lb/>
tical considerations in mind, he abandoned the illusionary technique of the ha-ha with which he had, following Brown, fostered an impression of unbro-<lb/>
ken rural scenery extending from distant pastures to the walls of the mansion. He even designed Garde-<lb/>
nesque flower beds in its immediate environs (see fig. 7.25). Repton's collected works, thanks to the <date when="1840">1840</date> edition edited by Loudon, were now a ready refer-<lb/>
ence for those who came to feel that the eighteenth-<lb/>
century approach to the Picturesque had been overly zealous in its eradication of traditional forms. Even Price regretted having removed the terraces of his country house, Foxley, in his youth. People now saw that terraces offered foreground interest and a pleas-<lb/>
ing transitional element between the necessary geom-<lb/>
etry of the house and the carefully contrived naturalistic character of its grounds.</p>

<p>Efficiency, a virtue of the new industrial age, was a demonstrable value in the landscape as well, with new attention being given to maintenance. The invention of the lawn mower made hand-cut grass and the bucolic lawn cropped by cattle things of the past (fig. 9.6). Scythes were laid aside, and large swards

of closely mowed green turf became highly desirable. Macadam paving now smoothed formerly rutted roads, which no longer meandered needlessly, if pic-<lb/>

lect that had overtaken estates during the turmoil of the Napoleonic wars was erased as owners instituted modern maintenance practices and employed tech-<lb/>
nology to improve their land.</p>

<p>Although there were periods of economic dis-<lb/>
tress in the nineteenth century, on the whole English prosperity was such that, at the prevailing low wages, small armies of gardeners could be put to work on the great estates. The head gardeners, who com-<lb/>
manded these workers while attending and inform-<lb/>
ing the landscaping tastes of their lordly masters, became important purveyors of the several Victorian garden styles as the trend toward imaginative historicizing brought several older design vocabu-<lb/>
laries&#x2014;-Jacobean English, Renaissance Italian, and seventeenth-century French and Dutch&#x2014;back into vogue. With this labor force and with railroad trans-<lb/>
portation to deliver materials from afar, including huge boulders for the rock gardens that became fash-<lb/>
ionable at this time, dukes and earls vied in the cre-<lb/>
ation of gardens where spectacular effects and horticultural virtuosity were important ends.</p>

<p><name type="pname">William Barron</name> (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>), the head gardener to the earls of Harrington at Elvaston Castle in Der-<lb/>
byshire, achieved renown for his tree-transplanting expertise and for creating a famous topiary garden. In assembling the unusual mature specimen trees and already shaped tall topiary shrubs for Elvaston's land-<lb/>
scape, he introduced the technique of moving plants with a large ball of earth still attached to their roots. Grafting, too, was a specialty at Elvaston and other gardens where composite trees assumed forms and vegetal characteristics never before seen in nature.</p>
<p>Landscape restoration often went well beyond what archaeology might have dictated in cases of period reconstructions in the Elizabethan and Jacobean manner, such as the one at Hatfield House, where the second marquess of Salisbury had knot gardens and a maze constructed (fig. 9.7). At Levens Hall in Westmorland, Alexander Forbes, the head gar-<lb/>
dener, set about restoring the topiary garden of around <date when="1700">1700</date>, and the apparent antiquity of this recon-<lb/>
struction may have persuaded even such an astute observer as Loudon of its being the original one rather than its re-creation (fig. 9.8).</p>
<p>Italianate gardens swept back into vogue as broad terraces and staircases with balusters and urn-<lb/>
shaped finials spilled gracefully down to English lawns dotted with floral beds. Besides this use of stepped terraces as transitional elements in the intermediate zone between the house and the extensive landscape beyond, there was with the work of William Andrews Nesfield (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881">1881</date>) a revival of the French <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie.</hi> Nesfield often based his designs on those provided in the pattern book of Dezallier d'Ar-<lb/>
genville, but he was versatile and enjoyed experi-<lb/>
menting with Tudor knot gardens as well. He worked at Kew between <date when="1844">1844</date> and <date when="1848">1848</date> in association with Decimus Burton. For this important commission, Nesfield adopted a style reminiscent of the period of William and Mary as he created a <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> terrace plat-<lb/>
form for the Palm House, laid out a <hi rend="italic">patte d'oie</hi> radiat-<lb/>
ing from it into a new Pinetum, or arboretum of coniferous evergreens, reconfigured the pond, and redesigned the Broad Walk (fig. 9.9).</p>
<p>Display fountains had long ago ceased to play in English gardens. To bring the delight of animated water back into the landscape, Capability Brown had created the woodland cascade, one of the few Brown-<lb/>
ian elements not attacked by the proponents of the Picturesque. Now, with industrial technology at hand, there was renewed interest in fountain construction,
<pb n="321"/>
<pb n="321" type="orig"/>
and some remarkable waterworks were created, such as <name type="pname">Joseph Paxton</name>'s Emperor Fountain at Chatsworth (see fig. 9.11).</p>

<figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.9. Plan of Kew Gardens from the <date when="1850">1850</date>s, showing Nesfield's alterations</hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>The green landscape took on myriad hues as brightly colored flowers from countries such as Mex-<lb/>
ico made their spectacular appearance in Victorian gardens. Color theory became one of the head gar-<lb/>
dener's job requirements. Not only did carpet beds&#x2014; mosaiclike seasonal display beds&#x2014;have to be designed for similarity of flower height and simul-<lb/>
taneity of bloom, but they also had to be laid out according to artistic principles dictating the juxtapo-<lb/>
sition of solid floral masses of contrasting and com-<lb/>
plementary rather than similar tones.</p>
<p>The challenge facing nineteenth-century designers was how to assemble all of these interest-<lb/>
ing, useful, and charming objects&#x2014;botanical speci-<lb/>
mens, historical ruins, glasshouses and summer-<lb/>
houses, rock gardens and kitchen gardens, flowers and fountains&#x2014;within a coherent framework. Loudon's designs owed their coherence to what he called the axis of symmetry. As he explained it:
<q>In the simplest kind of symmetry, the two sides are equal and alike, and the axis is, of course, eas-<lb/>
ily discovered; but in cultivated and refined sym-<lb/>
metry, the sides are unequal, and so combined and varied with the centre, that it requires the eye of a philosophical artist to detect the axis.<ref target="#CH9-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>Thus, Loudon sought a sense of balance, not a mir-<lb/>
ror imaging of parts, and his axes were not necessar-<lb/>
ily visible, but sometimes merely implied. With the axis of symmetry as an organizing principle, he arranged garden features and vegetation in various ways to produce a balanced effect.</p>
<p>Design harmony could also be achieved through congruity. Congruity meant respecting the character of the existing landscape as much as the abilities of the gardener, choosing local stones for boulders in rock gardens, placing water bodies in low-<lb/>
lying areas where they would naturally be found, ban-<lb/>
ning sculpture and architecture of a purely associative nature, avoiding discordant juxtapositions in the arrangement of exotic plants, and developing zones of transition between distinctly different parts of the garden, as for instance the area between a smooth lawn and a rock garden.</p>

<p>Except in cases where the intent was a histori-<lb/>
cizing one, Victorian designers usually avoided straight lines. They were inspired by the curvaceous Rococo lines of Batty Langley The circle was a much favored form and one advocated by both Repton and Loudon. Planting beds were frequently mounded in order to eliminate difficulties in viewing them from a ground-level perspective and to display their intri-<lb/>
<pb n="322"/>
<pb n="322" type="orig"/>
cate carpetlike designs to better advantage (fig. 9.10).</p>
<p>But rules are made to be broken, and contrast, rather than congruity, was the aim in some cases. In the hands of Joseph Paxton, some startlingly imagi-<lb/>
native effects were achieved through unexpected jux-<lb/>
tapositions of the seemingly natural and the highly artificial. Though not a landscape theorist and social philosopher like Loudon and with a practical man's distrust of intellectuals, Paxton more than any other immediate successor developed Loudon's vision in wedding technology to horticulture by designing one of <name type="place">England</name>'s earliest municipally funded public parks, Liverpool's Birkenhead Park.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Paxton</hi></hi></head>
<p>The life of <name type="pname">Joseph Paxton</name> (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">1865</date>) illustrates how technological aptitude, design creativity, and energetic industriousness offered upward mobility in the increasingly prestigious field of horticulture. The son of a farmer, Paxton worked as a gardening hand in his youth before going to <name type="place">London</name> at the age of twenty. Employed in the Horticultural Society's demonstration garden at Chiswick, located on prop-<lb/>
erty leased from the sixth duke of Devonshire, he impressed the duke, a frequent visitor, with his intel-<lb/>
ligence and abilities. In <date when="1826">1826</date>, the duke offered him the position of head gardener at Chatsworth, his Der-<lb/>
byshire estate. The subsequent flowering of Paxton's genius, combined with the duke's largess, soon made Chatsworth a seat of horticultural renown. Ignoring Loudon's advice to restore the grounds&#x2014;a Capabil-<lb/>
ity Brown landscape with surviving seventeenth-<lb/>
century features&#x2014;to a more naturalistic appearance, young Paxton set about repairing and improving the garden's original waterworks. He quickly met the challenge of reactivating the "Weeping Willow," an artificial tree and joke fountain that sprayed the unwary from eight hundred miniature jets of water. He did not, however, re-create the setting of the orig-<lb/>
inal as it appeared in the late seventeenth century, designing instead a woodland glen and rockworks as a naturalistic environment for this surprising hydro-<lb/>
logical feature. Paxton's mature landscape style con-<lb/>
tinued to be characterized by the same independence from aesthetic theory and easy synthesis of artificial and natural.</p>

<figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.11. Emperor Fountain, Chatsworth, Derbyshire, designed by Joseph Paxton. <date when="1843">1843</date></hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>His on-site education in landscape design his-<lb/>
tory occurred in the <date when="1830">1830</date>s as he accompanied the duke of Devonshire on tours of Versailles and other gardens near <name type="place">Paris</name>, the gardens of <name type="place">England</name>, and Ital-<lb/>
ian villa gardens. Studying the waterworks in these places, he perfected his hydrological skills, becoming the foremost English fountain engineer of the day after the creation of the Emperor Fountain at Chatsworth&#x2014;then the world's tallest (fig. 9.11). In Paxton's fountain designs, technology and art were one. Unlike earlier fountains, these did not usually include sculpture; the rainbow effect of light-struck spray and the choreographic pattern of multiple danc-<lb/>
ing jets created interest enough for Paxton and his patrons. His reputation ultimately rested on an even more spectacular demonstration of technology's uses in the garden, for his Great Stove at Chatsworth, an enormous greenhouse, won him international renown. This huge conservatory was built between <date when="1836">1836</date> and <date when="1840">1840</date> following Loudon's ridge-and-furrow design principle but using wood instead of wrought iron for the framing of its glass panes.</p>
<p>Paxton's growing reputation put him in the front rank of landscape designers receiving commis-<lb/>
sions from two sources. The first was private devel-<lb/>
opers who saw the relationship between communal pleasure grounds and the surrounding real estate in economic terms; the second was sanitary officials and humanitarians who saw the benefits of parks from public health and recreational perspectives. Nash's design for Regent's Park in <name type="place">London</name> had set a prece-<lb/>
dent for the former type of park development, and in <date when="1842">1842</date> a member of the Yates family, which had large landholdings in Liverpool, asked Paxton to come there to design Prince's Park, a speculative amenity that Yates hoped would make the adjacent house lots attractive to middle-class residents. Here Paxton cre-<lb/>
ated rows of terrace housing facing a curvilinear belt drive encircling a meadow with scattered clumps of trees and a serpentine lake (fig. 9.12).</p>
<p>Prince's Park remained in private ownership until <date when="1908">1908</date> and therefore was of little consequence in the growing parks movement as reformers in city after city, particularly in <name type="place">England</name>'s industrial Midlands, advocated "green lungs" within the swelling urban mass.<ref target="#CH9-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref>Paxton's next park, in Birkenhead on the oppo-<lb/>
site side of the Mersey River from Liverpool, was also undertaken with the hope of attracting members of
<pb n="323"/>
<pb n="323" type="orig"/>
the merchant class, but because of the circumstances of its creation, its accessibility to the general public, and the publicity that it received, it provided a far more influential model for future parks.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-385">

</figure>
<p>Municipalities had not yet been granted broad authority to acquire land, but citizen action to create public parks was nevertheless under way. In <date when="1842">1842</date>, a group of businessmen constituting Birkenhead's Improvement Commission lobbied for a parliamen-<lb/>
tary bill that would allow them to purchase 70 acres of land "for the Recreation of the inhabitants."<ref target="#CH9-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref>In the event, they purchased more than 200 acres, of which approximately 124 were designated parkland, with the remainder reserved for building sites. Although not, strictly speaking, the first public park, Birkenhead, which opened in <date when="1847">1847</date>, was the first to use public funds for parkland acquisition and devel-<lb/>
opment and to pay back this cost with the proceeds from the sale of the adjacent building lots. In addi-<lb/>
tion, the municipality assumed responsibility for its maintenance, establishing the precedent of using for this purpose earned income derived from grazing rights and the auctioning of hay.</p>
<p>As at Prince's Park in nearby Liverpool, at Birkenhead Paxton arranged blocks of terraces around the sinuous loop of a circuit drive embracing a large meadow, the outlines of which were defined by scattered groups of trees. Here the meadow was bisected by a principal artery, Ashfield Road. Paxton placed an irregularly shaped lake in each half, and in order to make it impossible to see the boundaries of the entire shoreline in a single view, he introduced islands in the lakes. Their dredging spoil was used to construct rocky berms that varied the topography and restricted the view lines, thereby creating a more inti-<lb/>
mate lakeside environment. Further, Paxton designed an independent path system for strolling through this landscape separate from that of the macadamized cir-<lb/>
cuit drive, which was intended for carriages.</p>
<p>From their inception, parks were popular ven-<lb/>
ues for sports as well as places for leisurely strolling in scenic surroundings. This caused difficulty for land-<lb/>
scape designers like Paxton, whose bias was to exploit the scenic potential of the site, as well as for admin-<lb/>
istrators and park managers, who were often forced to modify original designs to accept a variety of play facilities and who had to write regulations and deal with the consequences of sports use on the landscape. Sponsors sometimes even gave the active recreational motive primacy. In the case of two parks planned and built simultaneously in Manchester in the <date when="1840">1840</date>s, Philips Park and Queen's Park, the entrants in the design competition had to include gymnasiums, grounds for archery, and alleys for skittles and quoits. Further, they were instructed to remember the <hi rend="italic">public</hi> nature of the commission and the need to accommodate large gatherings of promenaders. Refreshment rooms, numerous park benches, drink-<lb/>
ing fountains, and lodges for caretakers were also part of the design program. Ball-playing and shuttlecock
<pb n="324"/>
<pb n="324" type="orig"/>
grounds and playgrounds with rope swings were included in the final designs. By contrast, <name type="pname">James Pen-<lb/>
nethorne</name>, the original designer, and John Gibson, a former Paxton employee at Chatsworth and super-<lb/>
intendent after <date when="1849">1849</date>, developed <name type="place">London</name>'s Victoria Park along scenic principles, using a rich palette of horticultural materials. But it, too, had to incorporate seesaws, climbing bars, and other play equipment and to permit, or at least tolerate, the use of its lakes for bathing, skating, boating, and dog washing.</p>

</figure>
<p>As at Stowe, Stourhead, and other eighteenth-<lb/>
century models, the architects at Birkenhead incor-<lb/>
porated historic English features and Palladian influences into the park's design vocabulary. Their ver-<lb/>
satility was apparent in their eclecticism, producing lodges in the castellated Gothic, Tudor, and Italian styles, in addition to the Greek Revival "Norman" ones set into the entrance gate (fig. 9.13). Here as elsewhere the influence of William Chambers lingered, and both Birkenhead and Victoria Parks had pagodas. Even as the popularity of pagodas faded, nineteenth-century building technology produced a cast-iron version, one example of which was shown at the <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name type="place">Philadel-<lb/>
phia</name> Exhibitions of <date when="1876">1876</date> before being permanently installed at Chapel Field Gardens in Norwich.</p>
<p>The Turkish kiosk, combined with elements derived from the Chinese pagoda, furnished a distinc-<lb/>
tive architectural idiom for the bandstand made of wood or cast iron and set on a tall masonry base. This type of raised, open, ornamental pavilion became a feature of many parks. Musicians played mostly clas-<lb/>
sical music, which was enthusiastically promoted by reformers as a civilizing influence and means of ele-<lb/>
vating mass culture, although Sabbatarians tried to proscribe concerts and other forms of recreation by having parks closed on Sundays. Temperance societies sponsored drinking fountains, and elaborate ones such as the Victoria Fountain in Victoria Park bore biblical and moral inscriptions implying the superiority of water over stronger drink (fig. 9.14).</p>
<p>As part of the reformers' agenda to wean the working class away from gin parlors, gaming, and other unedifying forms of recreation, sponsors deemed parks appropriate places for libraries and museums of art and natural history, and these were often combined with refreshment rooms. As more parks were created, commemorative monuments celebrating local benefactors, national leaders, and victory at war found a natural home amid their green-<lb/>
ery, often serving as centerpieces of floral beds. Nota-<lb/>
bles, royalty, and military heroes usurped the pedestals once graced by classical sculptures not only in <name type="place">Eng-<lb/>
land</name> where the parks movement originated, but else-<lb/>
where as it rapidly spread (see fig. 7.48). Public toilets, a much-debated amenity, were installed in several parks, and once this practice was established, manu-<lb/>
facturers began to produce cast-iron urinals. Winter gardens, or palm houses, modeled on the one at Kew and Paxton's Crystal Palace, provided microclimates for the palms, bromeliads, and other tropical plants that drew swarms of nineteenth-century park patrons. These also served, to the dismay of superin-<lb/>
tendents, as warm places where the homeless sought shelter in cold weather.</p>
<p>The mid-nineteenth century ushered in an era of international expositions, at which the increasingly mobile and educated middle class enjoyed displays of scientific technology and industrial arts. Steam and rail transportation made these events accessible for large numbers of people and therefore financially fea-<lb/>
sible. Leading the parade was <name type="place">London</name>'s Great Exhi-<lb/>
<pb n="325"/>
<pb n="325" type="orig"/>
bition of <date when="1851">1851</date>, for which Paxton built the world's most modern exhibition hall, the Crystal Palace, in Hyde Park. As <name type="place">New York</name> attempted to emulate <name type="place">Lon-<lb/>
don</name> with a Crystal Palace of its own in <date when="1853">1853</date>, Paxton set about transferring his hugely popular building, for which he received a knighthood, to a new site in <name type="place">Lon-<lb/>
don</name> at Sydenham. Conceived as a refined version of the pleasure ground, with operating costs paid from admission fees, Crystal Palace Park showed a differ-<lb/>
ent side of Paxton the park designer from the one demonstrated at Birkenhead. Here, instead of treat-<lb/>
ing the landscape in a naturalistic manner, he chose a plan of neo-Rococo geometric formality with a Pic-<lb/>
turesque fringe around the edges (fig. 9.15).</p>
<p>Paxton's place in landscape design history is an important one, linking the inventiveness, horticultural interest, and humanitarian social vision of Loudon with the growing parks movement in rapidly indus-<lb/>
trializing countries. With its republican government founded on the principle of social equality, <name type="place">America</name> was the ideal testing ground for municipal parks and other kinds of democratic institutions.</p>

<p>Much of the American landscape design vocabulary applied to parks and private estates in the early decades of the nineteenth century was derived from <name type="place">England</name>. There were, however, important differences in both the natural and the social climates of the two countries as well as the vastly disparate geographic scales of the island and the continental nation, one with a centuries-old habit of land husbandry and the other with a vast expanse of sparsely occupied prairie and woodland.

glas fir <hi rend="italic">(Pseudotsuga menziesii)</hi> and many other conif-<lb/>

<p>American botanists as well as those in Britain and other European countries were eager recipients of the seeds and cuttings that came from these sources as well as from the plant hunters foraging in other parts of the globe. Bartram's Nurseries in <name type="place">Philadel-<lb/>

<p>The generation to which <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson Downing</name> (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>) belonged was astutely observed by his contemporary Alexis de Tocqueville (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>), who covered 7,000 miles of the settled and wilderness portions of the United States and <name type="place">Canada</name> by steamer and stagecoach and on horseback during a nine-<lb/>
month period beginning in May <date when="1831">1831</date>. Tocqueville's <hi rend="italic">Democracy in America</hi> is much more than a traveler's description of the physical characteristics of the coun-<lb/>
try with its settled colonial villages, burgeoning new cities, and frontier outposts. Although there are trenchant observations of all these things, his work is, as its title suggests, a political treatise. As such, it was not designed merely to limn the national char-<lb/>
acter of the Americans as a simple narrative of their manners, mores, and economic circumstances would have done. Instead, its purpose was to foretell the con-<lb/>
sequences of the profound social transformation then in progress as the nations of Europe passed from aris-<lb/>
tocratic to democratic governance.</p>
<p>Downing had read the second volume of <hi rend="italic">Democracy in America</hi> as it rolled off the presses in <date when="1840">1840</date> His job, as he saw it, was to counter the restless insta-<lb/>
bility of his fellow citizens that Tocqueville had noted with visions of home as a cherished domain and place of charm. He wished to educate their taste, which would then make manifest republican virtue in the nation's landscape. He hoped that through a new vision of domestic comfort and refinement the "mod-<lb/>
erate amount of happiness" available to all men in a democratic society might be attained. His idealistic prescriptions were overrun during the post&#x2014;Civil War transformation of American capitalist culture into something that more closely resembled the class strat-<lb/>
ification evident in the nations of Europe. But during his lifetime, he securely occupied the middle ground between Jefferson's Federalist generation&#x2014;whose democratic principles were compromised by patri-<lb/>
cian values&#x2014;and the generation of opulent materi-<lb/>
alistic display that gave the "villas" and "cottages" he promoted a new scale and meaning. Downing was, in short, a champion of the middle class, and he held a strong faith in the ability of education to raise peo-<lb/>
ple, if not to economic equality, at least to a senti-<lb/>
mental equality in their appreciation and enjoyment of beauty.</p>
<p>Downing occupied the middle ground in a lit-<lb/>
eral sense. Deploring both the rude, ax-scarred utili-<lb/>
tarian landscapes that were a product of a frontier mentality and the cramped insalubrious atmosphere of the noisy commercial and industrial cities, he implied in his use of the word <hi rend="italic">rural</hi> the concept of the suburb. To the freestanding middle-class dwelling and its adjacent grounds, and even the humble working-<lb/>
class dwelling with its surrounding small plot of land, Downing directed owners and landlords to pay the same prideful attention as that lavished by the wealthy on their country seats. He saw these homes, outside but accessible to urban centers by new means of transportation, as part of a larger, inherently Pic-<lb/>
turesque American landscape, and he believed that if his architectural and landscaping recommendations were followed, residents of this middle ground would be making a patriotic contribution to the nation's overall beauty while increasing their own personal comfort and enjoyment.</p>
<p>His congenial mind did not reckon that rural privacy might become retreat from community. A product of the American rural town, as a professional horticulturist and citizen, Downing promoted village beautification by tree planting. More important, he did not ignore the city. His reformer's cry, more ardent than any other's, championed the public park as the fundamental civilizing institution of American democracy in the <date when="1840">1840</date>s.</p>
<pb n="327"/>
<pb n="327" type="orig"/>
<p>Downing illustrated an aspect of American life shrewdly observed by Tocqueville: citizen initiative. There was no higher authority than the people in a democracy, so there were no <hi rend="italic">royal</hi> academies. Public libraries, colleges, lyceums, museums of art and nat-<lb/>
ural history, botanical gardens, horticultural societies, rural cemeteries, and public parks&#x2014;all these educa-<lb/>
tional and cultural institutions were founded by the vision of individuals, the action of community organ-<lb/>
izers, and the will of legislators who were elected by the people. Downing's role as citizen advocate and spokesman within this context was an especially important one.</p>
<p>Downing, the youngest son of a nurseryman in Newburgh, <name type="place">New York</name>, was a self-taught botanist and student of the Picturesque. After his marriage at age twenty-three to Caroline DeWint of Fishkill Land-<lb/>
ing, he designed and built a home on the family prop-<lb/>
erty in Newburgh (fig. 9.16). This house and its grounds epitomized the life of rural refinement he wished for all Americans of moderate affluence. It represented as well his belief that as <name type="place">America</name> came of age, its rootless, restlessly moving people should sink down roots, beautify their properties, and build communities that were more than commercial cross-<lb/>
roads. Although similar to buildings in the "pointed" style recommended by Loudon, Downing's home had a particularly American feature&#x2014;the veranda, or piazza, as contemporaries called it&#x2014;which Downing promoted throughout his career in even his humblest samples of domestic architecture.</p>
<p>Thus situated, Downing could enjoy the com-<lb/>
mercial advantages of bustling Newburgh and the lively social intercourse made possible by the arrival at the town landing of friends traveling by river sloop and steamboat or at his door via train and carriage. He was within an easy three-hour train ride to <name type="place">New York</name> City, where he met with his publisher or con-<lb/>
ducted other business. At the same time, he could pre-<lb/>
serve the illusion of living in nature, never having to see town or road, only foliage-framed views of Hud-<lb/>
son River scenery. In attempting to come to terms with the nineteenth-century phenomenon of rapid metropolitan growth, Downing was perhaps unwill-<lb/>
ing to admit the degree to which the agricultural economy of the young republic was being rapidly superseded by an industrial one. For this reason he used the word <hi rend="italic">rural</hi> to denote his vision of the <hi rend="italic">sub</hi>-<lb/>
urban landscape that constituted the middle ground between city dwelling, with its noise, congestion, and extremes of wealth and poverty, and the equally unap-<lb/>
pealing alternative of hardscrabble farm life.</p>

</figure>
<p>Downing's vision for a new American scenery to overlay the rough, agrarian landscape of frontier farms hacked from the wilderness was in the time-<lb/>
honored pastoral mode in which art and nature were held in perfect balance. He dreamed of an American Arcadia, for, like Thomas Jefferson, he saw the oppor-<lb/>
<pb n="328"/>
<pb n="328" type="orig"/>
tunities inherent in the country's immense and immensely fruitful natural landscape. Husbandry combined with taste could capitalize upon <name type="place">America</name>'s natural beauty, turning the countryside into a collage of Picturesque scenery. But opposing forces were at work, and the discordant aspects of the American dream&#x2014;the industrial smokestacks of the city and the train tracks running beside the river&#x2014;had to be screened from view, if the pastoral imagery of the garden were to appear intact. In nineteenth-century <name type="place">America</name>, as in <name type="place">England</name>, ambivalence about the Indus-<lb/>
trial Age was expressed by placing utilitarian tech-<lb/>
nology and a highly eclectic architectural vocabulary of period styles within the same cultural embrace. Downing may have shared with others of his gener-<lb/>
ation a sense of anxiety as the machinery of capital-<lb/>
ism focused its energies on enterprises that would eventually destroy much of the picturesque charac-<lb/>
ter of aspiring rural towns, elm-canopied village greens, well-tended fields, and rich pastures fringed with woods. Nevertheless, as a reformer, a republican idealist, and a progressive Anglophile, he necessarily accepted both the democratic, technological future and the tradition-rooted, agrarian past. Whatever fears he may have harbored, he did not reveal them but optimistically projected a vision of universal bet-<lb/>
terment through the agency of good design.</p>

"Example of the Beautiful in Landscape Gardening" and "Example of the Picturesque in Landscape Gardening," as portrayed in Andrew Jackson Downing's <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to <name type="place">North America</name>,</hi> <date when="1841">1841</date></hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>In <date when="1841">1841</date>, while still running his nursery business, Downing published his first major work, <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening.</hi> Its clear prose and conversational tone soon gained him wide-<lb/>
spread public recognition and reputation as a horti-<lb/>
cultural authority and tastemaker. The first sections of the book demonstrate the breadth of his reading, particularly of works by Loudon and Repton. His knowledge of such landscape theoreticians as Whately, Price, and Gilpin is apparent in the contrast he draws between the beautiful and the Picturesque. In the sec-<lb/>
ond edition of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>), he had his engraver depict the beautiful, or "graceful" as he alternatively calls it, as a female-inhabited environment with gen-<lb/>
tly curving paths, softly rounded tree forms, and gra-<lb/>
cious Neoclassical architectural details, while directing him to portray the Picturesque with spirelike conifers, steeply pitched eaves, and other signs of spirited irreg-<lb/>
ularity, ruggedness, and angularity that presumably accord with the masculinity of the huntsman and his dog who complete the scene (figs. 9.17, 9.18).</p>
<p>The architecture compatible with the beautiful was "Italian, Tuscan, or Venetian," whereas builders in the Picturesque style had as appropriate models "the Gothic mansion, the old English or the Swiss cot-<lb/>
tage" and were free to incorporate in their schemes various rustic features. Downing reiterated Repton's three underlying principles of good design&#x2014;"UNITY, HARMONY, AND VARIETY"&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">unity</hi> being a con-<lb/>
trolling idea based on the nature of the site and "some grand or leading features to which the others should be merely subordinate,"<ref target="#CH9-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref><hi rend="italic">variety</hi> the development of spectator interest through intricacy and ornamental details, and <hi rend="italic">harmony</hi> the principle that ordered variety and made it subservient to the overall unity of the composition. Further, he tempered picturesqueness with practicality, declaring that "[f]irm gravel walks near the house, and a general air of neatness in that quarter, are indispensable to the fitness of the scene in all modes."<ref target="#CH9-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref>Concurring with Loudon, he maintained that "the <hi rend="italic">recognition of art"</hi> was "a first principle of Landscape Gardening . . . and those of its professors have erred, who supposed that the object of this art is merely to produce a fac-simile of nature."<ref target="#CH9-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref></p>
<pb n="329"/>
<pb n="329" type="orig"/>
<p>A large section of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> comprises a descriptive catalogue of deciduous and evergreen ornamental trees. Here Downing does more than dis-<lb/>
play his impressive store of botanical knowledge, dwelling upon aesthetic, rather than scientific, char-<lb/>
acteristics such as "the lights and shadows reflected and embosomed in [the oak's] foliage" and the "plea-<lb/>
sing richness and intricacy in its huge ramification of branch and limb"<ref target="#CH9-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>in the manner of Gilpin, whose works he had studied well.</p>
<p>In <date when="1846">1846</date>, when Luther Tucker of <name type="place">Albany</name> invited Down-<lb/>
ing to become editor of <hi rend="italic">The Horticulturist,</hi> this new journal of "Rural Art and Rural Taste," Downing gained a platform for his expanding ideas. Here, in an editorial he wrote each month, he propounded his landscape theories; shared observations gleaned from his travels; gave advice on rural architecture, transplanting trees, growing hedges, enriching soil, manuring orchards, improving vegetables, and pro-<lb/>
ducing wine; mingled poetry and instruction in a rhapsody on roses; provided detailed instruction on the building of greenhouses and ice houses; argued the case&#x2014;exercise, fresh air, health&#x2014;for women to garden; and sermonized on the mistakes of city folk new to country life&#x2014;all in a conversational voice and anecdotal style that endeared him to his read-<lb/>
ers. <hi rend="italic">The Horticulturist</hi> reached a large audience. In it he promoted the planting of shade trees in villages, towns, and cities; lobbied for an agricultural college in <name type="place">New York</name> State; and drew the attentions of his fellow citizens to such public parks as Munich's Englischer Garten.</p>
<p>In his column of <date when="1851-08">August 1851</date>, Downing warmed to the subject of a mayoral proposal for a 160-acre park in <name type="place">New York</name>, arguing that the city had "until lately, contented itself with the little door-yards of space&#x2014;mere grass-plats of verdure" and con-<lb/>
cluding that a park of even 160 acres was too small, that at least 500 acres were needed to serve the city's fast-growing population, which then stood at half a million. His vision for the new park was equally bold in its outlines. Not only would it have carriage drives, bridle trails, secluded walks, and "a real feeling of the breadth and beauty of green fields," but it would also be a place for commemorative statues, a winter gar-<lb/>
den like the Crystal Palace "where the whole people could luxuriate in groves of the palms and spice trees of the tropics, at the same moment that sleighing parties glided swiftly and noiselessly over the snow-<lb/>
covered surface of the country-like avenues of the wintry park without." Zoological gardens would also find a home there, as would spacious buildings for expositions of the arts. Above all, Downing extolled the social implications of the proposal. The park would be a republican institution, "a broad ground of popular refinement," raising "the working-man to the same level of enjoyment with the man of leisure and accomplishment."<ref target="#CH9-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The summer before, Downing had gone to <name type="place">Eng-<lb/>
land</name>, delighted that his reputation had preceded him and that he was welcome at Chatsworth and many other great estates. His purpose in traveling there was not merely to tour the English countryside and visit the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. In <hi rend="italic">The Horticultur-<lb/>
ist</hi> and in the books that followed his <hi rend="italic">Treatise&#x2014;Cottage Residences</hi> (<date when="1842">1842</date>), <hi rend="italic">Fruits and Fruit Trees of <name type="place">America</name></hi> (<date when="1845">1845</date>), and <hi rend="italic">The Architecture of Country Houses</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)&#x2014;archi-<lb/>
tectural illustrations played an important role. He had sold his nursery business as his focus centered more and more upon the literary efforts that were turning him into a tastemaker to the nation. The people who now sought him out wanted plans as well as advice, and with these prospective clients in mind and having failed to interest the American architect <name type="pname">Alexander Jack-<lb/>
son Davis</name> (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892">1892</date>) in entering into a professional partnership with him, he wished to find a young Eng-<lb/>
lish architect with whom he could open a design firm. In <name type="place">London</name>, he observed the drawings of Calvert Vaux at an exhibition of the Architectural Association and asked to meet him. The immediate impression of both men was such that a week later Vaux had wound up his affairs in <name type="place">England</name>, said good-bye to friends, and boarded ship for <name type="place">New York</name> with Downing.</p>
<p>The new firm immediately began to receive commissions, including one from the brewer Matthew Vassar to improve the grounds of his 40-<lb/>
acre farm, Springside, near Poughkeepsie, <name type="place">New York</name>. There was a subsequent important commis-<lb/>
sion from Daniel Parish to build a "marine villa" in <name type="place">Newport</name>, <name type="place">Rhode Island</name>, and other domestic proj-<lb/>
ects. In the Newburgh office, which Downing and Vaux built as an addition to the Downing residence, Vaux translated the Gothic Revival style he had learned in <name type="place">England</name> into a more distinctly American idiom, often using board-and-batten construction and wooden verge boards and designing deeply hooded windows, covered entrance porches, and broad verandas. From Downing he must have also learned to appreciate the Picturesque possibilities of the American landscape.</p>
<p>In the fall following the return of the two men from <name type="place">England</name>, Downing was invited by President Mil-<lb/>
lard Fillmore to prepare a plan for the improvement of the public grounds around the Capitol in <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington</name>, where L'Enfant's intentions for a grand avenue had never materialized. Downing eagerly seized this commission as an opportunity to demonstrate the first <hi rend="italic">"real</hi> park in the United States."<ref target="#CH9-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref> Although vexed by congressional infighting, the project received initial funding. On the L-shaped site encompassing the
<pb n="330"/>
<pb n="330" type="orig"/>
present-day Mall and grounds of the White House, Downing developed an extensive pleasure ground and botanical showcase, a series of six Picturesque and Gar-<lb/>
denesque episodes linked by curvilinear carriage drives and paths. Directly behind the White House, the plan called for a President's Park, entered through a mar-<lb/>
ble triumphal arch. Also called the Parade, this was where various public and military functions would take place. Surrounding the <name type="place">Washington</name> Monument, still in construction, Downing envisioned a meadow-<lb/>
like park of American specimen trees and grass. The Tiber Canal flowed between these two parks. The plan proposes to connect them by means of a suspension bridge. It also calls for an Evergreen Garden, a show-<lb/>
case for such nondeciduous species as rhododendrons, laurels, and magnolias. Smithsonian Park is a natura-<lb/>
listic campuslike space, with evergreens comple-<lb/>
menting <name type="pname">James Renwick</name>'s neomedieval building. To the east, is Fountain Park containing both a fountain and a small artificial lake.</p>
<p>In <date when="1852">1852</date>, Downing was commuting to <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, on a monthly basis when his life was suddenly cut short as the <hi rend="italic"><name type="pname">Henry Clay</name>,</hi> a Hudson River steamboat on which he was traveling, caught fire, causing the passengers to jump overboard and many, including him, to drown. Without his periodic on-site supervision and advocacy of the plan's construction, party politics, exacerbated by the impending crisis of the Civil War, mired the project.</p>
<p>Extensively eulogized, Downing nevertheless died encumbered with debt. The house he had built&#x2014;for fourteen years a center of hospitable friendship, his office, and a manifestation of the Pic-<lb/>
turesque and Gardenesque taste he advocated&#x2014;had been mortgaged and was soon sold. His books, how-<lb/>
ever, continued to be published into the twentieth century, and the editorials he had written for <hi rend="italic">The Hor-<lb/>
ticulturist</hi> were collected in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Rural Essays,</hi> which also enjoyed wide readership.</p>
<p>Downing's position in landscape history is a piv-<lb/>
otal one. He was both an imitator of the styles devel-<lb/>
oped by Repton and Loudon and an innovator, translating their Picturesque vocabulary, particularly in architecture, into a new American idiom. But his influence was more as an "apostle of taste" than as a designer, rhetorically setting the course that others would follow. The term <hi rend="italic">landscape architect</hi> had not yet been adopted by Calvert Vaux and Vaux's future part-<lb/>
ner, Frederick Law Olmsted as a professional tide.<ref target="#CH9-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref> Neither of these men ever forgot his debt to Down-<lb/>
ing as together they forged a landscape style in which broad passages of pastoral and woodland scenery gave the beautiful and the picturesque a more thor-<lb/>
oughly American dimension than had Downing's transitional style with its Loudon-derived emphasis on horticulture and architecture. The park that they designed for <name type="place">New York</name> was essentially different from the image Downing had painted for his readers in his essay in <hi rend="italic">The Horticulturist,</hi> but his prescience in pro-<lb/>
moting it as a vital democratic institution was one that they fully embraced as they in turn developed a new vision for the nineteenth-century city.</p>

<p>The taste that Downing had promoted and the human-<lb/>
itarian consciousness he had displayed in championing the public park were, as we have seen, manifestations of the cultural shift that Tocqueville observed not only in his own country and the United States where there had been revolutions abolishing rule by monarchy, but also throughout Europe where court-dominated aris-<lb/>
tocratic culture was being superseded by more broadly based, egalitarian forms of governance. Socially con-<lb/>
scious tastemakers such as Loudon and Downing were important precisely because the city itself was becom-<lb/>
ing a far-flung middle-class institution. As <name type="place">London</name> had already demonstrated a century earlier, the city and the private estates that were its rural outposts, not the court, determined culture, and the bourgeoisie who were now primary cultural consumers welcomed the reformers' advice that refined them and elevated them above those less fortunate.</p>
<p>Although <name type="place">Italy</name> and <name type="place">Germany</name> were slow to become unified states, the trend toward nationalism had been set in motion, and bonds of cultural com-<lb/>
monalty among their respective principalities, duke-<lb/>
doms, and city-states were reinforced through language, art, trade, and travel as well as by military alliance. The growth in nationalistic spirit paralleled the growth in importance and size of urban centers. With the diminution of the power of kingship, of the prestige of the Church, and of the wealth of aristoc-<lb/>
racy, the monuments that had once broadcast the supremacy of these institutions lost meaning. As soci-<lb/>
eties rebuilt themselves along more democratic and sectarian lines, they felt compelled to create images of <hi rend="italic">constitutional</hi> monarchs, revolutionary heroes, and the honored dead as icons of national status and civic pride, replacing older monuments of kings and reli-<lb/>
gious figures.</p>

<p>Commemorating national heroes assumed impor-<lb/>
tance as nineteenth-century nations sought to insti-<lb/>
tutionalize recently formed governments or cloak their military adventures abroad in a mantle of impe-<lb/>
rial glory by celebrating them in a public and perma-<lb/>
nent manner. This patriotic agenda called for the renaming of important urban places and the erection of monuments within them. For this reason, in <date when="1841">1841</date>, the English raised a 185-foot high column by <name type="pname">William Railton</name> in <name type="place">London</name>'s Trafalgar Square to honor <name type="pname">Admi-<lb/>
ral Horatio Nelson</name>, the hero of the <date when="1805">1805</date> Battle of Trafalgar. In a similar fashion, the French commem-<lb/>
orated Napoleon's campaigns of <date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805">1805</date> with a bas-<lb/>
relief column modeled after Emperor Trajan's column in <name type="place">Rome</name>. It was erected in <name type="place">Paris</name> in the Place Vendôme, formerly the Place Royale, where the equestrian statue of Louis XIV had long since been toppled by a revolutionary mob (fig. 9.19).</p>
<p>In <name type="place">Germany</name>, as we have seen, the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> was an expression of cultural pride, and the sculptures there were intended to foster patriotic sentiment. We have noted as well how <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s remains, at first entombed on the estate of an <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> liberal aris-<lb/>
tocrat, were removed to the Church of Saint Genevi&#x00E8;ve, which was deconsecrated and rechris-<lb/>
tened the Panth&#x00E9;on when it became a hall of fame for French national heroes. Many objected to the transfer of the great man's bones to the Panth&#x00E9;on in <name type="place">Paris</name>, preferring instead the notion of pilgrimage to the tomb designed for him by Hubert Robert on the Isle of Poplars at Ermenonville (see fig. 7.36). The Enlightenment had bred a new secular spirit, and the French Revolution had seriously undermined the authority of the Catholic Church, making rural, rather than churchyard, burial an appealing alterna-<lb/>
tive, especially given the Romantic sentimentalism of the day in which many found in deified Nature a spir-<lb/>
itual substitute for Church dogma.<ref target="#CH9-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> In the same spirit as that of the Europeans who turned the grave site at Ermenonville into a shrine and even replicated <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s tomb in numerous other Picturesque gar-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Birth of the Rural Cemetery</hi></hi></head>
<p>The waning of ecclesiastical authority and the growth of Romantic sentiment among a rapidly broadening middle class brought new attitudes toward death and the desire to commemorate upstanding community members and loved ones as well as heroes. Added to this cultural imperative was the public health motive, about which there was much debate, for the crowd-<lb/>
ing that accompanied population increases in nine-<lb/>
teenth-century cities was noticeable not only in the festering urban slums, but also in the churchyard cemeteries that were filled to capacity so that corpses were periodically exhumed to make room for new ones. The resulting stench of putrefying flesh caused passersby to hold their noses as physicians argued inconclusively over whether "miasmas" from decay-<lb/>
ing animal matter bred disease.</p>
<p>The notion of a permanent resting place where the dead could be visited by the living and remem-<lb/>
bered individually did not accord with either Catholic or Calvinist belief. Both held that mortal flesh, even in life, was corrupt and an encumbrance to the spirit, which, freed of mortality, could join God. Viewed in this light, the collective sight of the dead served as a reminder of the transitory nature of earthly life and a warning against vanity and pride. The equation of the afterlife with an Edenic gardenlike paradise did not fig-<lb/>
ure in pre-nineteenth-century Western theology, and tree planting in cemeteries was considered an encour-<lb/>
agement of latent tendencies toward pantheism, which priests and ministers wanted to stamp out. Not the living tree but the death mask was depicted on Puritan tombstones in <name type="place">New England</name> graveyards: this <hi rend="italic">memento mori</hi> was meant to discourage worldly ambi-<lb/>
tion and individualism. Only with the decline of Puri-<lb/>
tanism did the symbolism of vegetative endurance and cyclical rebirth manifest itself in the substitution of the sweetly melancholy willow-tree-and-urn motif, also found in mourning pictures, for the death mask on some slab gravestones (fig. 9.24).</p>
<p>The creation of the extramural "rural" ceme-<lb/>
tery demanded a significant change in societal values involving the secularization of death and the grant-<lb/>
ing of dignity to the individual life as well as the right to associative sentiment on the part of families and friends. In the aftermath of <name type="place">London</name>'s Great Fire of <date when="1666">1666</date>, both John Evelyn and Christopher Wren had urged the discontinuance of churchyard burial, and the eighteenth-century Whig garden, replete with emblems of commemoration, offered an important prototype for the cemetery amid shady groves. Wordsworth's Romantic poetry evoked a mood of elegiac remembrance in images of country grave-<lb/>
yards, while in a prose essay he instructed that "when
<pb n="333"/>
<pb n="333" type="orig"/>
death is in our thoughts, nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature, and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay, which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind."<ref target="#CH9-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>It was not in <name type="place">England</name> but in <name type="place">France</name>, however, that the first metropolitan rural cemetery came into being. There, the post-Revolutionary invention of new institutions to replace discredited old ones and the growing fashion (initiated by Rousseau's tomb at Ermenonville) for memorials set in nature provided the impetus for a change in burial customs. In addi-<lb/>
tion, new scientific theories of photosynthesis sup-<lb/>
ported the practice of tree planting as conducive to urban health, and people began to desire the sight of cemeteries with grass lawns rather than bare earth. Historic preservation also played a role in those tur-<lb/>
bulent times when many royal monuments had been recently removed from churches and public places. Preservationists such as Antoine-Chrysostome Qua-<lb/>
trem&#x00E8;re de Quincy argued for incorporating the sal-<lb/>
vage into cemeteries as proud relics of French cultural heritage. In <date when="1796">1796</date>, the National Institute of Sciences and Arts called for papers on new customs and sites for burying the dead. In his prizewinning essay, the classical scholar Amaury Duval evoked the custom of antiquity as precedent for extramural burial, for in ancient Athens burial of notables took place in the Kerameikos, the pottery-making district outside the Dipylon Gate, and in ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> the dead of prominent families were laid to rest in tombs along the Appian Way. He declared that for himself, he wished a grave in nature like Rousseau's.</p>
<p>The argument was echoed by others. There were proposals for the burial on private property of those, such as farmers, who owned land, and for those who did not, the authorities were encouraged to set aside dignified public burial grounds outside the city where family tombs would receive the remains of the departed, which would no longer be placed anony-<lb/>
mously in common graves. In <date when="1801">1801</date>, legislation was passed authorizing the communes of <name type="place">France</name> to pur-<lb/>
chase land outside their boundaries for public ceme-<lb/>
teries, and two years later the Department of the Seine created the first one on a high escarpment near the eastern edge of <name type="place">Paris</name>. Known as the Cemetery of the East but called P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise after the Jesuit priest P&#x00E8;re François de La Chaise, Louix XIV's confessor, who had once owned the land, it was laid out accord-<lb/>
ing to a plan developed by the architect Alexandre-<lb/>
Th&#x00E9;odore Brongniart (<date when="1739">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813">1813</date>) in a manner that combined axial geometry and monumental focal points with the picturesqueness of a serpentine cir-<lb/>
cuit path and naturalistic plantings. A central <hi rend="italic">tapis vert</hi> led the visitor to the site of a chapel, designed as an Egyptian pyramid, which was never built because work was halted by the Napoleonic wars. To the left of this greensward axis were the plots reserved as grave sites for the masses, where five-year and ten-<lb/>
year leaseholds replaced the common burial pits of former times. On the higher terrain was institution-<lb/>
alized the concept of freehold ownership in perpetu-<lb/>
ity for families who wished to purchase plots.</p>

<graphic url="CH9_026.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>Although common folk immediately began to bury their dead in the leasehold area, the sale of the perpetual plots was slow at first, gathering momen-<lb/>
tum after monuments purporting to be the tombs of <name type="pname">Ab&#x00E9;lard</name> and <name type="pname">H&#x00E9;loise</name>, <name type="pname">Moli&#x00E8;re</name>, and <name type="pname">La Fontaine</name> were installed and then joined by the actual ones of such contemporary celebrities as <name type="pname">Fr&#x00E9;d&#x00E9;ric Chopin</name>. Civic pride rose with the burial of other cultural and polit-<lb/>
ical heroes, and by the <date when="1820">1820</date>s, as they laid departed family members to rest, many denizens of the fash-<lb/>
ionable world sought the services of the funerary architects, stonecutters, iron-fence makers, and florists who had set up shop nearby. Mausoleums occupying entire plots soon gave P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise the appearance of a miniature city of handsome stone dwellings, rather than that of a pastoral landscape of memory, as it was intended to be. Nevertheless, because of the famous names on many of the tombs and in spite of its overbuilt appearance, P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise continues to be both a mecca for tourists and a tranquil refuge for contemporary Parisians (figs. 9.25, 9.26).</p>
<pb n="334"/>

<p>Americans, like the French at this time, were developing civic institutions that accorded with their republican ideals. They, too, wanted to create ceme-<lb/>
teries that honored their brief national history, digni-<lb/>
fied the dead, and consoled the living. Their means of achieving this end was not by government decree as in <name type="place">France</name> but, in a tradition Tocqueville recognized, through voluntary associations of citizen-reformers, who in this case developed a vision, enlisted support, formed a corporation, and sold burial plots.</p>
<p>Many people at the time resisted the placement of the dead outside town boundaries, inasmuch as maurading wolves were a still-recent menace and bur-<lb/>
ial within insecure extramural precincts would facil-<lb/>
itate the work of "resurrection men" who harvested corpses for medical dissection. However, as early as <date when="1796">1796</date>, <name type="pname">James Hillhouse</name> persuaded his fellow citizens to subscribe to a burial ground on Grove Street immediately north of <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s original nine-<lb/>
square grid. Connecticut passed legislation estab-<lb/>
lishing the first private corporation in <name type="place">America</name> for that purpose, and under Hillhouse's direction, poplars were planted and freehold plots sold in perpetuity. Unlike the rural cemeteries that followed a genera-<lb/>
tion later, the New Burying Ground in <name type="place">New Haven</name> was remarkable for the precedent it set rather than for its design, which was, like the rest of the town, a straightforward grid plan offering convenient circu-<lb/>
lation for hearses and visiting families but little in the way of Romantic picturesqueness.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Mount Auburn Cemetery</hi></hi></head>
<p>Such was not the case in <name type="place">Boston</name>, where the builders of Mount Auburn Cemetery exploited the potential of a naturally picturesque site across the Charles River on the border between <name type="place">Cambridge</name> and Watertown. Here again, an energetic and visionary individual spearheaded the citizen effort responsible for launch-<lb/>
ing the cemetery project in <date when="1825">1825</date>. Botanist, physician, and community leader Dr. <name type="pname">Jacob Bigelow</name> interested the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Horticultural Society in sponsor-<lb/>
ing the project. Earlier, Mayor Josiah Quincy had been a vocal proponent of a public cemetery somewhere on the outskirts of the city, but it took Bigelow's advo-<lb/>
cacy of the cause, combined with the enthusiastic par-<lb/>
ticipation of Henry Dearborn, the president of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Horticultural Society, to bring the con-<lb/>
cept to fruition.</p>
<p>The cultural climate of <name type="place">Boston</name> provided strong impetus to the cemetery movement in <name type="place">America</name>. There patriotic sentiment was strong, voluntary associations numerous, and religion liberalized through the agency of the Unitarian pulpit. <name type="place">Boston</name> was, moreover, within the intellectual orbit of Con-<lb/>
cord where Thoreau and Emerson projected the phi-<lb/>
losophy of transcendentalism and preached as well as practiced communion with nature. The American poet William Cullen Bryant (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">1878</date>), along with Wordsworth, touched a responsive chord in the breasts of New Englanders such as Bigelow and Dearborn, for whom the word <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi> denoted the manly emotion of remembrance with pleasura-<lb/>
ble melancholy, not maudlin excess, in a period when many fathers mourned the death of young wives and children. Bryant's most famous poem, "Thanatop-<lb/>
sis" (<date when="1817">1817</date>), gave voice to Bigelow's medically and horticulturally informed opinion that the rapid dis-<lb/>
solution of the uncoffined body laid to rest in nature constituted a sweet surrender of individual existence. At the same time, memory of the individual life lived within the bosom of family and community would be honored in epitaphs inscribed on monuments, and these would inspire others to lives of goodness and achievement.</p>
<p>The site for the new cemetery was secured in <date when="1830">1830</date> when another proponent, <name type="pname">George Watson Brim-<lb/>
mer</name>, sold to the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Horticultural Society a particularly beautiful piece of property consisting of 72 acres of heavily wooded, hilly terrain, the char-<lb/>
acteristic <name type="place">New England</name> landscape of drumlins&#x2014; ridges deposited by successive epochs of glaciation &#x2014;and bogs, and ponds left in the wake of the retreat-<lb/>
ing ice. Poetically inclined Harvard students, who liked to frequent this naturally picturesque spot of bosky dells, grassy knolls, and an abandoned colonial farmstead, called it Sweet Auburn after a vanished English hamlet destroyed by the enclosure move-<lb/>
ment, which Oliver Goldsmith had lamented in his poem "The Deserted Village" (<date when="1770">1770</date>). Like P&#x00E8;re Lachaise, it had a high point or mount from which a panoramic prospect unfolded&#x2014;hence Mount Auburn&#x2014;but unlike the French cemetery where there was no stream or pond, it had a deep enfolding small valley into which water gushed and pooled. The tide of sentiment ran high as Joseph Story, associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, delivered his consecration oration to an estimated audience of two to three thousand Bostonians gathered in this nat-<lb/>
ural amphitheater on <date when="1831-09-24">September 24, 1831</date>.</p>
<p>For the next three years, the society's president, Dearborn, masterminded the project, serving as the cemetery's landscape designer. Like others of his gen-<lb/>
eration, Dearborn was a man of multiple talents and capable of practicing them at a professional level. To ready himself for the task at hand, he sent to <name type="place">London</name> and <name type="place">Paris</name> for books and engravings dealing with land-<lb/>
scape theory and design, including an account of the creation of P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise, which he translated for the benefit of his fellow citizens. He also steeped himself in the works of Repton and Price as he thought about
<pb n="335"/>
<pb n="335" type="orig"/>
how to turn the naturally Picturesque cemetery site into both a commemorative landscape and an exper-<lb/>
imental garden. This horticultural component was integral to his broad vision, as was the notion of cre-<lb/>
ating a studio school on the premises for the instruc-<lb/>
tion of professional landscape designers.</p>
<p>The author of a two-volume treatise on Greek architecture, Dearborn now sought to develop siting opportunities for the monuments that would make Mount Auburn an American version of Stowe or Stourhead (see Chapter Seven). His plan provided a circulation system that looped around the hilly topog-<lb/>
raphy in parabolic curves, providing efficient access for hearses to all parts of the grounds and, supple-<lb/>
mented by additional paths, a means of strolling through the delectable scenery (fig. 9.27).</p>
<p>Although the two men never admitted a breach, a rift between Dearborn's and Bigelow's supporters was soon apparent. The horticultural faction sided with Dearborn's more inclusive vision of Mount Auburn as a broad-based landscape institution, with an active program of practical instruction like that of the <name type="place">London</name> Horticultural Society where Paxton had apprenticed, while others supported Bigelow's more focused one of a cemetery alone. This resulted in an official separation in <date when="1834">1834</date>, with the reincorporation of the Cemetery Proprietors of Mount Auburn as an independent entity.<ref target="#CH9-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref> As head of the trustees of the ten-member board governing Mount Auburn, Bigelow exerted a strong influence on the rules and regulations governing the cemetery's administration and visitation policies, at the same time exercising his considerable talents as an architect by designing sev-<lb/>
eral of its monuments.</p>
<p>Policy forbade slab tombstones like those found in the old <name type="place">New England</name> churchyards where the fore-<lb/>
bears of the Mount Auburn trustees were buried. Bigelow and others looked to Classical Greece and ancient <name type="place">Egypt</name> for a symbolism that reflected the lib-<lb/>
eral Unitarian and Universalist spirit preaching salva-<lb/>
tion for all and the heavenly reunion of families, which now prevailed over the stern philosophy of Calvinist predestination whereby only a tiny minority&#x2014;the elect&#x2014;were deemed eligible for reward after death. The obelisk, appropriated by ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> as a tro-<lb/>
phy of conquest and converted by Renaissance city planners and garden builders into a widely copied landscape feature, connoted both timelessness and the death-embracing culture of ancient <name type="place">Egypt</name>. Somewhat miniaturized, obelisks were frequently employed in eighteenth-century English gardens as memorials to cultural and political heroes. Just as an obelisk memo-<lb/>
rialized George <name type="place">Washington</name>, now scaled-down ver-<lb/>
sions in white marble marked the resting place of prominent <name type="place">Boston</name> families who purchased plots in Mount Auburn. In addition, Bigelow used a pair of obelisks decoratively to frame the imposing neo-<lb/>
Egyptian style gate he designed for entrance to Mount Auburn, which bore the inscription: "Then shall the Dust return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit shall return unto God who gave it"<ref target="#CH9-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref> (fig. 9.28). Pillars and pedestals surmounted by urns and sarcophagi resem-<lb/>
bling Rousseau's tomb were also popular among the first proprietors (fig. 9.29).</p>

<p>In James Smillie's <date when="1847">1847</date> engravings, the white marble monuments that had superseded the Puri-<lb/>
tans' gray slate tombstones gleam brightly against the dark foliage in the still heavily forested cemetery (fig. 9.30). Within the romantically Picturesque land-<lb/>
scape, they act as poetic accents. The atmosphere of
<pb n="336"/>
<pb n="336" type="orig"/>
a forest glen is intentional. In the early years of the cemetery's existence, in keeping with the founders desires to retain as much as possible the inherent charms of the site, maintenance was limited to keep-<lb/>
ing gravel paths accessible; only in the second half of the nineteenth century did the cemetery assume a parklike aspect. Also evident is Mount Auburn's intended function as a didactic landscape, a place of moral instruction, for the engravings show parents with young children in tow as well as solitary figures meditating in its sweetly melancholy gloom. The cemetery's purpose as a contemplative landscape was underlined by the publication of visitors' guides with brief, inspiring biographies of the distinguished dead. In spite of its role in expressing community values and community pride, the plots were private prop-<lb/>
erty, and the proprietors not only erected monu-<lb/>
ments&#x2014;often in anticipation of their deaths&#x2014;to function as future genealogies in stone, but they also fenced their places of perpetual rest with handsome cast-iron fences.</p>

<p>Although Bigelow promoted interment directly in the ground, many plot owners constructed chamber tombs similar to those at P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise. Some chamber tombs were nestled into hillsides and faced with granite after stonecutters perfected techniques for carving and incising this durable material (fig. 9.31). As the cemetery began to acquire more burial plots, memorial sculpture, and works of architecture, notably Bigelow's Gothic Revival chapel and his George <name type="place">Washington</name> Tower, it also acquired a greater degree of horticultural ornamentation. New trustees exercised keen fiduciary oversight and were careful to set aside funds from the proceeds of lot sales for landscape maintenance. Gradually Mount Auburn became, as it remains today, a memorial garden enriched by the mixture of many exotic and native plant species.</p>
<p>Bigelow designed and donated the cemetery's last major embellishment, a monumental female Sphinx, dedicated in <date when="1871">1871</date> to the Union dead (fig. 9.32). By this time, mnemonic devices and landscapes evok-<lb/>
ing the past were less compelling to a new generation of Americans more interested in progress than in the past. Idealization of republican virtue and the domes-<lb/>
tication of death seemed less important after the Civil War than materialistic success and optimistic faith in the future. The notion of history as continuous lin-<lb/>
ear improvement that many Americans came to iden-<lb/>
tify with their nation's peculiar destiny fostered an attitude of denial toward death and an aversion to reminders of human mortality and the decline of civ-<lb/>
ilizations. By contrast, the founders of Mount Auburn held that history was cyclical, believing that the young republic they were shaping would one day, like <name type="place">Rome</name>, fall into ruin. Their elegiac monuments were meant for future generations to read as a testament to the greatness of the republican experiment in <name type="place">America</name>, the solidarity of families, and the virtue and industry of the men and women commemorated within its idyllic precincts.</p>
<p>Mount Auburn served as the progenitor of rural cemeteries in other cities: Laurel Hill in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> (<date when="1836">1836</date>), Green Wood in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> (<date when="1838">1838</date>), Spring Grove in Cincinnati (<date when="1845">1845</date>), and Cave Hill in Louisville (<date when="1848">1848</date>). In addition, it exerted an influence over the old bar-<lb/>
ren burial grounds in cities, and these, now no longer in active use, were given iron fences, grass, trees, and shrubs, becoming the pleasant green urban oases they are today.</p>
<p>Although there were plenty who left written records demonstrating that the didacticism of Mount
<pb n="337"/>
<pb n="337" type="orig"/>
Auburn effectively touched them much as Bigelow and the other founders had hoped, even in the early years of its existence, people did not necessarily go there for moral uplift. From its inception, the ceme-<lb/>
tery was an immensely popular place for an outing, so much so that superintendents issued admittance passes and enforced rules restricting certain types of recreation. The same was true at Green-Wood, the <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> cemetery where Manhattan residents flocked on Sundays for a holiday in scenic surround-<lb/>
ings. Their evident enjoyment of this form of recre-<lb/>
ation caused some civic-minded New Yorkers to ask the question: why not a people's park devoid of reminders of mortality?</p>

<p>Vaux left Newburgh and moved to <name type="place">New York</name> in <date when="1856">1856</date> at a time when the city was beginning to develop a lively artistic culture. In addition to theaters and music halls, department stores had opened their doors on Broadway, and shopping and promenading to enjoy both the commercial and the social spectacle had become a pleasurable routine for many New Yorkers. At the same time, the city's thriving port and com-<lb/>
mercial enterprises attracted a swelling volume of immigrants, particularly after the potato famine of the <date when="1840">1840</date>s in <name type="place">Ireland</name> and political turbulence in the wake of several failed revolutionary movements in Europe in <date when="1848">1848</date> stimulated mass exodus from coun-<lb/>
tries abroad. <name type="place">New York</name> reformers organized societies to minister to the needy, and although public health had been greatly improved after the Croton Aque-<lb/>
duct brought pure drinking water to the city in <date when="1842">1842</date>, crowding now fostered both disease and vice. With few exceptions, <name type="place">New York</name> had little to offer in the way of publicly accessible greenery. There was the Battery, the city's historic waterfront promenade at the foot of Manhattan Island; City Hall Park; Jones's Wood, an informal 160-acre picnic grove beside the East River between Sixty-sixth and Seventy-fifth Streets; and Green-Wood, the immensely popular rural cemetery in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>. The city's residential squares&#x2014;St.John's Park, Gramercy Park, Union Square, <name type="place">Washington</name> Square&#x2014;were mostly fenced, with access restricted to neighboring property holders. Well-to-do <name type="place">New York</name> businessmen&#x2014;the city's civic leaders&#x2014;travel-<lb/>
ing abroad noticed the parks in <name type="place">England</name>, <name type="place">France</name>, and <name type="place">Germany</name>, which had been opened to the general populace as a matter of royal favor or <hi rend="italic">noblesse oblige.</hi> It was obvious to them that to satisfy their recreational needs and especially those of their wives and children, as well as to establish their city competitively as a pleasant and civilized urban center of international importance, they should take responsible action to

improve it by constructing a public park. In this they were urged forward by women whose work in vari-<lb/>
ous charitable associations made them conscious of the importance of this type of environmental and humanitarian improvement for the poor and whose burgeoning cosmopolitanism made them long as well for an American version of Hyde Park or the Champs-<lb/>
Elys&#x00E9;es where they could readily socialize in public. Uptown landowners stood to gain from the im-<lb/>
provement a park would bring to surrounding real estate, so they were natural proponents in bringing the plan forward.</p>
<p>After much contentious debate, the state legis-<lb/>
lature passed a bill in <date when="1853">1853</date>, authorizing the acquisi-<lb/>
tion of land below the existing Croton Reservoir in the center of the island between Seventy-ninth and Eighty-sixth Streets and north of it where the large New Reservoir was being built between Eighty-sixth and Ninety-sixth Streets. <name type="pname">Fernando Wood</name> (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881">1881</date>), <name type="place">New York</name>'s Democratic mayor after <date when="1854">1854</date>, saw that a large public works project could assist immi-<lb/>
grant laborers and, incidentally, his own bank account, inasmuch as he was heavily invested in park-<lb/>
side real estate. In what later historians would cite as his single heroic act, he exerted his leadership in favor of proceeding with the construction of Central Park between Fifth and Eighth Avenues and 59th and 106th Streets.</p>

<p>It was now necessary to acquire the land. Beginning in the fall of <date when="1853">1853</date>, a commission surveyed and esti-<lb/>
mated the value of the building lots and improve-<lb/>
ments on the site of the future park, meeting numerous futile complaints, particularly from landowners within the park who felt they had invested more capital and labor in improving their holdings than the price they were being awarded. Even so, the $5 million land acquisition cost far exceeded the cost that had been projected for the <hi rend="italic">built</hi> park. As the park-<lb/>
land was exempted from the market, the surround-<lb/>
ing property automatically went up in value. Regulations to curb certain activities considered to be nuisances such as piggeries and bone-boiling works were enacted, making the area surrounding the park desirable for the future as a place of fashionable resi-<lb/>
dence. By <date when="1857-10-01">October 1, 1857</date>, with considerable hard-<lb/>
ship on the part of many former residents, including those clustered in an active African-American com-<lb/>
munity known as Seneca Village on the west side of the park, the park site was cleared of inhabitants.</p>
<p>Anxious to wrest power from Mayor Wood, the legislature in <name type="place">Albany</name>, which was dominated by the newly formed Republican Party, removed authority over Central Park from the city and placed it under a state-appointed, eleven-member commission. Egbert Viele (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902">1902</date>), the engineer Wood had appointed to survey the park, was reappointed by the newly formed Board of Commissioners. Vaux had seen the plan Viele had prepared in <date when="1856">1856</date> for the park, which Wood had approved, and he realized how inferior it was with respect to the opportunity at hand. Vaux had recently acted as a founding member of the American Institute of Architects, and he now organ-<lb/>
ized a successful lobbying effort for a design compe-<lb/>
tition in order to achieve a plan that, according to him, would not disgrace the city or the memory of Down-<lb/>
ing. On <date when="1857-10-13">October 13, 1857</date>, the commission announced the terms of the public competition, and Vaux now became instrumental on the first of two significant occasions in directing the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted into the service of landscape design.</p>
<p>Olmsted had previously met Vaux once when he called upon Downing in Newburgh. But at that time he had no idea that he would pursue landscape as a career. Having first established himself with his father's financial help on Staten Island as a gentleman farmer employing the scientific principles similar to those pioneered by Loudon, he had felt impelled to travel abroad in <date when="1850">1850</date> to study English agricultural practices at firsthand, recording his observations in a book, <hi rend="italic">Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in <name type="place">Eng-<lb/>
land</name>.</hi> Its critical success led him to pursue further jour-<lb/>
nalistic endeavors based upon travel. Choosing the pen name "Yeoman," he dispatched a series of letters to the newly formed <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">New York</name> Daily Times,</hi> from var-<lb/>
ious points along the routes he took through the American South and the frontier states as far west as <name type="place">Texas</name>. His constant theme was the superiority of free labor over slave agriculture, but interwoven into his text were passionately vivid descriptions of the coun-<lb/>
tryside. Self-taught in his uncle's library where he may

have first encountered the writings of Price and Gilpin, he was, like his father who had taken him on carriage rides as a boy in search of the Picturesque, a discriminating connoisseur of natural scenery. Now, however, the Panic of <date when="1857">1857</date> had forced the publishing house for which he worked to close. Being prevented from pursuing his literary career as a publisher and the editor of <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Monthly Magazine,</hi> Olmsted was grateful to receive the job of superintendent of the clearing operations for Central Park under the super-<lb/>
vision of Viele, the engineer-in-chief.</p>
<p>Vaux had learned a good deal about landscape design as he worked with Downing on the improve-<lb/>
ment of the public grounds in <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, as well as on the private estates where they collaborated, but he realized that Olmsted's daily familiarity with the park landscape and his stature as an author and person of moral influence would make him an ideal partner in the design competition. Thus began the friendship of the architect and literary-man-turned-<lb/>
administrator as they paced together over the park's terrain and formed the vision embodied in the com-<lb/>
petition entry they labeled the Greensward Plan (fig. 9.33). By judiciously clearing away here and planting there, by moving earth to rearrange the land into gen-<lb/>
tly rolling contours, by laying drains and converting swamps into ponds, there would emerge a landscape that was both pastoral and Picturesque.</p>
<p>To understand the Greensward Plan and the subsequent work of the two men after they became professional partners, one must attempt to enter the mind of Olmsted as fully as possible, for however much intelligence and design ability Vaux contributed, Olmsted's brand of nineteenth-century spirituality and democratic humanitarianism supplied something fundamentally philosophic to their common vision of the designed landscape. This vision was akin to Downing's in that it was rooted in a belief that parks in cities and the domesticated middle landscape of freestanding homes set in parklike surroundings away from the crowded urban workplace would act as a civilizing force in society. But Olmsted's more com-<lb/>
prehensive view of landscape was not derived from Downing or from Loudon, Downing's preceptor.</p>
<p>Downing had recast Loudon's concepts to suit the conditions of American society and the country's natural landscape, recommending a Picturesque and sometimes rustic architectural vocabulary to harmo-<lb/>
nize with and accent picturesque scenery. But, like Loudon, he was a horticulturist who valued plant dis-<lb/>
play for its own sake. Olmsted&#x2014;"Yeoman"&#x2014;found the Gardenesque style a fussy distraction from the park's real purpose, which was the creation of rural scenery that evoked a poetic mood lifting one out of everyday care and ennobling the spirit with intima-<lb/>
tions of the divine. This kind of scenic contemplation was therapy for the overworked paterfamilias, a healthful occupation for women, a positive educa-<lb/>
tional influence upon children, and a means of accul-<lb/>
turation for the masses. Olmsted never presented himself as having botanical expertise, preferring plants arranged for their overall artistic effect to those pre-<lb/>
sented as individual scientific specimens.<ref target="#CH9-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref>The task of incorporating the recently enriched botanical palette into garden compositions in which specimen trees or beds of flowers were objects of attention was for him irrelevant to the business of park making.</p>

</figure>
<p>For the same reason, Olmsted held that archi-<lb/>
tecture and sculpture should be subservient to land-<lb/>
scape. Utilitarian and decorative elements should be placed within an overall impression of tranquilly beau-<lb/>
tiful and ruggedly Picturesque rural scenery. In later years, when he served as mentor to aspiring young landscape architects, he did not direct them to the works of the prominent nineteenth-century authors, Loudon and Downing, but rather to those of Price
<pb n="340"/>
<pb n="340" type="orig"/>
and Repton. Like these eighteenth-century writers, he saw landscape not as a collection of features artis-<lb/>
tically arranged for display, but rather as a shifting panorama, a sequence of views and vistas that opened up harmoniously as one moved through the coun-<lb/>
tryside or city park. His own deepest religious expe-<lb/>
riences were, like those of his father, Wordsworthian and transcendentalist&#x2014;rapt responses to the beauti-<lb/>
ful and sublime in nature. He also loved the rich, pic-<lb/>
turesque mystery of things half-concealed by overhanging vines. His keen emotional response to lush tropical effects caused him to attempt to simu-<lb/>
late the scenery he had seen in the Louisiana bayous and on the Isthmus of Panama in an American-<lb/>
inflected version of the eighteenth-century English Picturesque. By exploiting such optical characteristics as the play of light and shade in the shadows cast by trees across a sunlit meadow, the atmospheric haze of a distant umbrageous horizon line, and the mystery suggested by an intricate fringe of vines screening a shadowy entrance to a grotto, he created a design idiom that was both naturalistic and Romantic.</p>

<p>His immersion as a young man in the "green, dripping, glistening, gorgeous!" landscape of rural <name type="place">England</name>&#x2014;"enchantment indeed, we gazed upon it and breathed it&#x2014;never to be forgotten"<ref target="#CH9-n24"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">24</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;had imprinted his mind with an imagery of pastoral beauty that served him as lasting inspiration, but the English class system that achieved this beauty for the advantage of a few aristocrats through the enclosure movement and the hard labor of the poor offended his sense of social responsibility. The sight in <name type="place">England</name> that had impressed him most happily from a demo-<lb/>
cratic standpoint was Paxton's Birkenhead Park: "Five minutes of admiration, and a few more spent in studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was ready to admit that in democratic <name type="place">America</name>, there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this People's Garden."<ref target="#CH9-n25"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">25</hi></hi></ref>Now, thanks to Vaux's invitation to join him in the design competition for Central Park, he had the chance to work on a far grander scale to create a "People's Garden" in <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
<p>Because of Olmsted's daytime duties as super-<lb/>
intendent and the many interruptions by an incessant stream of job seekers, he and Vaux did much of their collaboration on moonlit nights as they paced the future park, appreciating the scenic potential of its bold outcroppings of Manhattan schist, proposing certain topographical alterations in order to deepen swamps into lakes and mound soil into rolling mead-<lb/>
ows. They studied where to place drainage lines and discussed the configuration of carriage drives and the
<pb n="341"/>
<pb n="341" type="orig"/>
best vantage points for vistas. Friends gathered in the evenings at Vaux's house on Eighteenth Street to assist in the preparation of the pen-and-ink drawing. On <date when="1858-03-31">March 31, 1858</date>, the deadline for the competition, Olmsted and Vaux submitted their Greensward Plan, which now hangs in the Arsenal, the <name type="place">New York</name> City Department of Parks headquarters in Central Park. On <date when="--04-28">April 28</date>, the commissioners announced their deci-<lb/>
sion to award first prize and the announced premium of $2,000 to the Vaux-Olmsted team.</p>
<p>The element that more than any other defines an Olmsted-Vaux landscape is a spacious meadow with gentle rises and scattered clumps of trees arranged about its periphery so as to lead the eye beyond its indeterminate boundaries into an illu-<lb/>
sionistic distance of seemingly unending rural scenery. It was difficult to achieve in Central Park because of its broken topography and narrow rectangular shape. Above Ninety-eighth Street, however, there was a piece of tableland that lent itself to becoming the North and East Meadows, while below the Sixty-Fifth Street Transverse Road the designers proposed blast-<lb/>
ing away bedrock in order to fill and level the surface for a Ball Ground. Because the transverse road's below-grade level made it inconspicuous, the Ball Ground was visually united with the 14-acre Sheep Meadow immediately north of it (figs. 9.34, 9.35). Together these two green areas served to portray as best possible the designers' scenic desideratum in the park's south end. To nourish a thick mat of turf for the grazing flock that would enhance the park's pas-<lb/>
toral appearance they covered the Sheep Meadow with 2 feet (.6 meters) of topsoil. Grading the park's borders into low berms and planting trees "to insure an umbrageous horizon line"<ref target="#CH9-n26"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">26</hi></hi></ref>was another feat of landscape legerdemain the designers employed in order to screen from view the future four-story houses that would rise along the suddenly valuable frontage lots.</p>

<p>The most ingenious aspect of the Greensward Plan was the engineering of four east-west crossings to carry workaday city traffic through the park along below-grade transverse roads (fig. 9.36). Here, too, low berms with plantings screened from park visitors' sight the carts and draft animals moving on these roads. In executing the Greensward Plan, Olmsted and Vaux carried the principle of grade separation of traffic one step further by segregating pedestrians from carriage traffic and riders on horseback. This gave Vaux, often in association with Jacob Wrey Mould, the opportunity to design a number of stone arches for paths and bridle trails carrying pedestrians and horseback riders beneath carriage drives as well as a handful of ornamental cast-iron bridges for paths spanning bridle trails (figs. 9.37,9.38). Bow Bridge, at the narrow neck between the two lobes of the Lake, allowed pedestrians to cross from the foot of Cherry Hill to the Ramble, an intricately designed woodland for strolling. It constitutes Vaux's masterwork in this mid-nineteenth-century building material (fig. 9.39).</p>

</figure>
<p>Today Olmsted and Vaux are sometimes criti-<lb/>
cized as being the carriers of patrician values and the agents of elitist objectives because they created a park for scenic viewing by carriage and on horseback&#x2014;as well as on foot&#x2014;and did not cater to a greater degree to more populist pastimes involving games and sports. This viewpoint imposes a later value system on their objectives and ignores the fact that, at the time they designed Central Park, the physical recreational move-<lb/>
ment still lay in the future. For their romantically inclined generation, scenic strolling was a healthful pastime much enjoyed by all classes. They were sin-<lb/>
cere in their belief that this pleasure, which Olmsted deemed to be akin to being moved by poetry, would soften the lives of the less fortunate members of soci-<lb/>
ety, which included many newcomers from other countries. They were convinced that the park's pas-<lb/>
toral and Picturesque scenery would serve as an infor-<lb/>
mal public school, instructing immigrants through an unconscious process of scenic enjoyment in the shared values, which were still predominantly agrar-<lb/>
ian, of the new democratic society-in-formation.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that there were certain prospec-<lb/>
tive users who felt few transcendental stirrings in the presence of scenery and who saw the park merely as a social arena, a place to parade their wealth and mar-<lb/>
riageable daughters, often exercising ill-disguised class prejudice. But this did not mean that the idealism expressed in the vision of Olmsted and Vaux was not genuine. They did not discourage such immediately popular activities as ice-skating and boating on the Lake, and the rules Olmsted promulgated as superin-<lb/>
tendent were designed to protect the park from over-<lb/>
use and abuse rather than to discriminate against a class of users. Most important, the Greensward Plan was supple in its ability to absorb new uses over the years. Unlike many of the landscapes presented to the pub-<lb/>
lic by the twentieth-century park builder <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>, which typically consist of single-purpose recreation facilities, the spaces Olmsted and Vaux created are able to serve a variety of purposes. In his writings, Olmsted divided the park's landscape into two kinds of space: "neighborly" and "gregarious," the former being for small groups consisting of families and friends who came to the park to picnic and enjoy scenery, while the latter was designed to serve the parade of strangers who congregated in the manner of Parisians on boule-<lb/>
vards to enjoy the spectacle of one another. The park was thus intended as a place in which to delight in both nature and one's common humanity.</p>
<p>Absent from the Greensward Plan were Down-<lb/>
ing's proposed "noble works of art, statues, monu-<lb/>
ments and buildings," although in <date when="1880">1880</date> Vaux built the first structure housing the Metropolitan Museum inside the park near Fifth Avenue and East Eighty-sec-<lb/>
ond Street. In addition, a conservatory originally planned near Fifth Avenue and East Seventy-fourth Street was constructed in <date when="1899">1899</date> in the north end of the park near Fifth Avenue and East 105th Street on the site where Olmsted had set up a temporary nursery and botanic garden. Throughout the park, the rural motif ruled in the predominant interest of "neigh-<lb/>
borly" recreation, but an important area was reserved for "gregarious" purposes: the elm-arcaded Mall, a straight concourse extending from Sixty-fifth to Sev-<lb/>
enty-second Street, which was set on a diagonal axis
<pb n="343"/>
<pb n="343" type="orig"/>
to detract attention from the park's rectilinear bound-<lb/>
aries. Focused upon Vista Rock in the distance, which Vaux later crowned with the neo-Gothic, castlelike Belvedere, this grand promenade, designed for socia-<lb/>
ble congregation, leads strollers to a broad stairway and through the Arcade beneath the Seventy-second Street Cross Drive to the lakeside Terrace, Vaux's architectural masterpiece (fig. 9.40).</p>
<p>Here, with his collaborator Mould, Vaux designed a pair of monumental staircases carved with ornamental panels, profuse with motifs of vegetation and wildlife representing the four seasons. These grand stairs provided an alternative means of reach-<lb/>
ing the Terrace, useful for those alighting from car-<lb/>
riages parked on the Cross Drive rather than passing on foot from the Mall through the Arcade. In the cen-<lb/>
ter of the circular Terrace, a jet sent a plume of water into the air until it was replaced in the <date when="1870">1870</date>s by a foun-<lb/>
tain surmounted by a sculpture representing the angel that bestowed healing power upon the pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem.<ref target="#CH9-n27"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">27</hi></hi></ref>This work by Emma Steb-<lb/>
bins (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) celebrated the public health bene-<lb/>
fits brought to the city a generation earlier by the Croton Aqueduct, and the figures at the fountain's base symbolize the blessings of Temperance, Purity, Health, and Peace. Two tall poles with ornamental bases and crossbars for long vertical fishtail banners stand next to the Lake where the designers effected a seemingly effortless transition from modest grandeur to Picturesque simplicity. This achievement is evident also in the way the designers made the geometric lines of the Mall and Terrace merge gracefully with the curving paths and naturalistic scenery alongside them.</p>
<p>In the south end of the park, the designers paid particular attention to the needs of women and chil-<lb/>
dren, visitors who might not wish to wander far from its principal entrance at Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. Immediately south of the Sixty-fifth Street Transverse Road and serviceable from it, Vaux con-<lb/>
structed the Dairy, a small building of rusticated stone with an ample wooden loggia providing shel-<lb/>
ter from the sun and inclement weather. Here children could play with toys furnished by a park attendant or drink fresh cow's milk. The designers christened a large nearby outcrop of Manhattan schist the Kinderberg. Polished by glacial scouring to form a natural slide, it had broad steps carved into its base and a rustic shelter crowning its top. The fenced playgrounds that are popular attractions in today's park were added after <date when="1934">1934</date> by <name type="pname">Moses</name>, but in the nineteenth century, park workers set up portable swings and seesaws in season.</p>
<p>In the original Greensward Plan, the northern border of the park is at 106th Street where an arbore-<lb/>
tum was specified but never built on the east side, while on the west side there was nothing beyond the Great Hill, which Olmsted and Vaux encircled with an appendage to the West Drive to afford carriage rid-<lb/>
ers panoramic prospects from this high point in the park. The commissioners soon realized that the topography between 106th and 110th Streets would not readily permit urban development because it was both too elevated by bedrock protrusions and too swampy where the resistant Manhattan schist gives way to the easily erodible Inwood marble that under-<lb/>
lies the Harlem plain. They wisely acquired this addi-<lb/>
tional land in <date when="1863">1863</date>, increasing the park's size from 750 acres to 843 acres. This allowed Olmsted and Vaux to save the sites of several fortifications left from the Rev-<lb/>
olution and the War of <date when="1812">1812</date>, to promote as a forest of native American trees an already wooded area, and to create the Harlem Meer in the park's new north-<lb/>
east corner, a much larger water body than the Pond in the southeast (fig. 9.41).</p>
<p>An army of a thousand workers, directed at first by Olmsted, moved nearly 5 million cubic yards, or approximately 10 million one-horse cartloads of stone, earth, and topsoil out of or into the park between <date when="1858">1858</date> and <date when="1873">1873</date>. In addition, Olmsted super-<lb/>
vised chief landscape gardener Ignaz Anton Pilat in planting a rich variety of trees, shrubs, and vines. Moreover, he promulgated park rules and oversaw the training of a cadre of park keepers responsible for maintaining order and educating the public to respect the landscape. All the while, to his intense irritation, he was subjected to the oversight and penny-pinching curtailments imposed by the park commission's comptroller, Andrew Haswell Green.</p>

<p>In <date when="1861">1861</date>, the Civil War interrupted the partners' collaboration on the ongoing creation of Central Park. Olmsted, who prided himself on his adminis-<lb/>

<p>Until <date when="1863">1863</date>, when he accepted a position as the resi-<lb/>
dent manager of the Mariposa Mines in <name type="place">California</name>, Olmsted helped reorganize the Army's Medical Bureau, took charge of distributing food and goods collected from branches of the Sanitary Commission in the North, and oversaw the evacuation of wounded Union soldiers on hospital transport ships. In <name type="place">Cali-<lb/>

mendations on the management of the Yosemite Val-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>At this period in his life, Olmsted still considered landscape design merely as a sideline. As the fortunes of the Mariposa mining venture sank, he considered returning to a career in journalism. At the same time, Vaux, who had been forced by political pressure to resign his Central Park position, wrote Olmsted say-<lb/>
ing that they had been offered reappointment as land-<lb/>
scape architects&#x2014;the title they chose for their profession&#x2014;in Central Park and that there was another important commission awaiting collabora-<lb/>
tion: Prospect Park in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>, named for the ele-<lb/>
vation known as Mount Prospect.</p>
<p>Olmsted, loath to subject himself again to the kind of "squabbles with the Commission and the politicians" he had experienced in Central Park, was reluctant to accept Vaux's second entreaty to enter into collaboration. Vaux, however, urged him as per-<lb/>
suasively as possible: "I am perhaps deficient in per-<lb/>
sonal ambition&#x2014;but I can feel for it in others. If you do not see that you are honored by developing this fitness for art work of course&#x2014;don't come. It must be the art of landscape architecture and the art of administration combined. Think this over. We are nei-<lb/>

Possible together, impossible to either alone."<ref target="#CH9-n28"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">28</hi></hi></ref>Olmsted was still reluctant to consider himself an artist but thought that he could "do anything with proper assistants, or money enough&#x2014;anything any man can do. I can combine means to ends better than most, and I love beautiful landscapes and rural recreations and people in rural recreations&#x2014;better than anybody else I know."<ref target="#CH9-n29"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">29</hi></hi></ref>Still uncertain that he could make a living in this line of work, he nevertheless decided to return to <name type="place">New York</name> and join Vaux in the continuing con-<lb/>

</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Creating Prospect Park</hi></hi></head>
<p>Vaux had already convinced James Stranahan, the pres-<lb/>
ident of the park board, that the original site author-<lb/>
ized by the state legislature&#x2014;350 acres straddling Flatbush Avenue&#x2014;was less desirable than the west-<lb/>
ern portion of this site plus a large tract of adjoining farmland where there existed the opportunity to cre-<lb/>
ate an illusion of infinitely extensive rural space and a large lake. The popularity of ice-skating in Central Park made an even larger Prospect Park lake compet-<lb/>
itively attractive, and the park commissioners agreed to divest themselves of the portion of their original site east of Flatbush Avenue&#x2014;land now occupied by the <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> Museum of Art and <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> Botanic Garden&#x2014;and to purchase the site recommended by Vaux, bringing the park's total acreage to 526.</p>
<p>The park did not have prominent, ice-polished rock outcrops like the ones that picturesquely accented the scenery in Central Park, but it was situ-<lb/>
ated on a glacial moraine. This provided a naturally rich soil and a gently rolling terrain as well as glacial erratics&#x2014;large boulders left after the ice melted. The designers artfully employed these as compositional elements when they built the Ravine between the Long Meadow and the Lake (figs. 9.42, 9.43). In cre-<lb/>

strained by the disposition of the park's boundaries
<pb n="345"/>
<pb n="345" type="orig"/>
as they had been in Central Park where they were hampered by the firmly rectilinear shape dictated by the <date when="1811">1811</date> grid plan for Manhattan. Also, in Prospect Park they were free of the necessity of providing transverse roads for nonpark traffic. Thus they were able "to connect a series of dissevered and isolated patches of comparatively level ground, into one sweep of grass-land that is extensive enough, to make a really permanent impression on the mind."<ref target="#CH9-n30"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">30</hi></hi></ref>On the perimeter of the Long Meadow&#x2014;considered by many as the quintessential Olmstedian landscape&#x2014; they mounded earth into berms and then created spa-<lb/>

<p>As in Central Park, the designers created a space for "gregarious" recreation in the elegant concert grove with ornamental stonework by Vaux similar to that which distinguished Bethesda Terrace in Central Park. The concert grove is flanked by an upper and a lower carriage concourse accessible from the park's sinuous circuit drive, and the whole ensemble constituted an informal amphitheater oriented to face the small Music Pavilion located on an island in Prospect Lake, now covered over by the Wollman Rink.

<p>As walled cities became things of the past after the formation of nation-states and as industrial technol-<lb/>
ogy provided means of transportation that effectively shrank distance, making it possible to commute between widely separated places of work and home, the spatial envelope of cities became greatly enlarged. In spite of a lingering Jeffersonian bias in favor of a predominantly agrarian destiny for <name type="place">America</name>, manu-<lb/>
facturing and commerce were breeding increasingly large urban populations, and this fostered an unprece-<lb/>
dented growth in the size of cities. Public sanitation victories through the kind of engineering technology represented by <name type="place">New York</name>'s Croton Aqueduct system and other Industrial-Age improvements such as smooth macadam roadbeds instead of cobblestone paving made large cities more livable than before.</p>
<p>But they still presented many difficulties for their inhabitants, the most notable being deprivation of contact with nature as the countryside became
<pb n="346"/>
<pb n="346" type="orig"/>
increasingly distant from the city. Olmsted and Vaux felt that a single park's role as a civilizing influence, ameliorating the noise and hectic pace of the metrop-<lb/>
olis, was still somewhat limited. They envisioned the carriage drives within parks being extended to become parkways, tree-canopied transportation cor-<lb/>
ridors connected to other parks, the whole forming a new framework superimposed over the grid, a green skeleton guiding the city's expansion. They saw, moreover, that roadway layout necessarily dictated the pattern and nature of urban growth, with resi-<lb/>
dential development of a more elegant nature being spawned by a circulation system that segregated pri-<lb/>
vate estates from commercial through traffic. In their grasp of the city as an evolving regional organism they were the country's first urban planners.</p>

</figure>
<p>The parity implied by the <date when="1811">1811</date> grid plan for <name type="place">New York</name> City was congenial to the expressed dem-<lb/>
ocratic values of the new republic. Moreover, it was a practical convenience for developers. Nevertheless, Olmsted wrote scathingly about its disadvantages. He felt the <name type="place">New York</name> grid to be especially uncongenial to the needs of people because the block sizes dic-<lb/>
tated by its street layout forced property to be divided into deep lots, usually no wider than 25 feet (7.6 meters). This resulted in rows of cramped narrow houses with poor light and ventilation. He wished to remedy this condition by carrying the park influence to the level of a system, with greenery easily accessi-<lb/>
ble throughout the metropolitan area. Where land had not yet been platted, lots for homes could be cre-<lb/>
ated that would permit healthful cross ventilation, penetration by sunlight, and a green lawn. Unlike the grid with its straight streets intersecting at right angles and static perspectives, the parkway system would conform to topography and scenic opportunity, which could be captured by the kind of curving align-<lb/>
ments that allowed the landscape to unfold from a series of ever-changing vantage points.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The First Parkways</hi></p>
<p>The creation of the <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> park offered Olmsted and Vaux the opportunity to advocate a more com-<lb/>
prehensive vision for the metropolitan landscape. In their preliminary report to the commissioners dated <date when="1866-01-24">January 24, 1866</date>, they articulated under the heading "Suburban Connections" the desirability of a pleas-<lb/>
ure drive connecting Prospect Park with the beach on the Atlantic Ocean. Imaginatively, they saw how another drive could run east along the beach, then pass through undeveloped countryside, continuing parallel with the East River until it touched the shore at Ravenswood, Queens, where either by ferry or high bridges as yet unbuilt it would connect with one of the wide crosstown Manhattan streets leading to Cen-<lb/>
tral Park. Further, they envisioned this extensive greenway dedicated to pleasure driving extending west from Central Park to the Hudson River, where it could run for a distance parallel to that river with views of the Palisades on the opposite shore and, in the distance, the blue outline of the Shawangunk Mountains.</p>
<p>Two years later after work on the park had begun, Olmsted and Vaux used the report they deliv-<lb/>
ered to the board as an opportunity to expound this metropolitan-scale planning concept. They now pro-<lb/>
posed a scheme, which went beyond their original one of a recreational parkway linking two major parks with the region's ocean beaches and extensive river waterfront, to encompass the notion of <name type="place">Brook-<lb/>
lyn</name>'s destiny as an ideal residential community. Even allowing for shipping and commercial activity equal to that of Manhattan across the river, much of the city&#x2014;although it had not yet become a borough of Greater <name type="place">New York</name>&#x2014;could function as a bedroom suburb. "<name type="place">Brooklyn</name> is <name type="place">New York</name> outside the walls,"<ref target="#CH9-n32"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">32</hi></hi></ref> they wrote, an implied reference to the faubourgs that had earlier sprung up outside the walls of <name type="place">Paris</name> and other walled cities in Europe.</p>
<p>In their report Olmsted and Vaux detailed the history of urban street plans from medieval times to the present, citing the missed opportunity when Wren's plan was ignored in the rebuilding of <name type="place">London</name> after the Great Fire of <date when="1666">1666</date>. They proposed for <name type="place">Brook-<lb/>
lyn</name> the first elements of a major arterial system that took into account the need for smooth roadbeds for the increasingly numerous light spring-suspension carriages, which were "quite unfit to be used in streets adapted to the heavy wagons employed in commer-<lb/>
cial traffic."<ref target="#CH9-n33"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">33</hi></hi></ref>At the same time, they realized that
<pb n="347"/>
<pb n="347" type="orig"/>
delivery carts and other kinds of commercial traffic could not be banned from abutting residential pro-<lb/>
perty altogether.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the new avenue de l'Im-<lb/>
p&#x00E9;ratrice (now avenue Foch), which Olmsted had seen on a trip to <name type="place">Paris</name> in <date when="1859">1859</date>, and <name type="place">Berlin</name>'s great tree-<lb/>
lined avenue, Unter den Linden, each of which was connected to a large park while simultaneously serv-<lb/>
ing as "an intermediate pleasure-ground [rather] than a part of the general street system,"<ref target="#CH9-n34"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">34</hi></hi></ref>the designers sketched the route of Ocean Parkway leading from Prospect Park to the beach at Coney Island and that of Eastern Parkway running from the park toward the Williamsburg section of <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> (fig. 9.45). A third parkway was proposed to link the park with Fort Hamilton and the site of the future Marine Park over-<lb/>
looking the Verrazano Narrows to the south.</p>
<p>The designers further remarked that new pub-<lb/>
lic transportation improvements made possible the occupation of a much larger urban area at lower den-<lb/>
sities than heretofore. Separation of residence and workplace was a corollary of this enlargement of towns. <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>, "set apart and guarded by nature as a place for the tranquil habitation of those whom the business of the world requires should reside within convenient access of the waters of <name type="place">New York</name> har-<lb/>
bor"<ref target="#CH9-n35"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">35</hi></hi></ref> was ideally situated to become a pleasant res-<lb/>
idential suburb. Olmsted and Vaux hoped that with its domestic character established by the parkway and street system recommended in their report, the kind of energetic self-made young men who had left their leafy country towns for the commercial opportuni-<lb/>
ties of the city would be drawn to purchase property in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>'s new middle landscape. It was a model that could be replicated as <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> and other cities grew, extending themselves to encompass their sur-<lb/>
rounding rural coun-<lb/>
tryside. The loss of that countryside to urbanization was compensated for by the abundant greenery of the now more loosely woven fabric of the metropolitan landscape with its park-<lb/>
ways connecting city dwellers to the generously scaled new urban parks filled with rural scenery.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Buffalo's Park System</hi></hi></head>
<p>The firm that Olmsted and Vaux had formed was now called upon to consult in other cities. Even as they were writing their report to the <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> com-<lb/>
missioners outlining their parkway concept, they were advising the city of <name type="place">Newark</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, that large cultural institutions such as museums were extrane-<lb/>
ous to rural parks and should be built outside them and that, in considering the acquisition of land for a public park, the town fathers should also consider pur-<lb/>
chasing strips of land for future construction of pleas-<lb/>
ure drives and walks. They gave similar advice to clients in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> and <name type="place">Albany</name>. It was in Buffalo, however, that the partners got to implement an entire park-and-parkway system. There, in <date when="1804">1804</date>, <name type="pname">Joseph Elli-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>A group of citizens in Buffalo, <name type="place">New York</name>, sum-<lb/>
moned Olmsted in the fall of <date when="1868">1868</date> to examine three sites under consideration for a park. He traveled to the city for a site meeting and admired its departure from the grid in its layout. He then proceeded to sketch a plan that grafted onto this street pattern a system of parkway-linked parks. The new plan thus consisted of not one, but all three park sites with parkways connecting them to one another (fig. 9.46). The 350-acre Delaware Park gave the designers an opportunity to create a large meadow and a 46-acre lake and to provide an extensive circuit drive with grade separation of intersecting pedestrian paths as in Central and Prospect Parks. A second park, the Front, occupied 36 acres overlooking the Niagara River near its entry into Lake Erie and was designed as a viewing terrace, which could also accommodate large gatherings. The Parade, a 56-acre tract on ele-<lb/>
vated land near the eastern edge of the city, where military functions took place, included children's play equipment and Vaux's large refectory. The parkways, 200-foot-wide (61-meter-wide) landscaped boulevards, now lined with handsome residences, remain a much-<lb/>

<p>Almost simultaneously, in Riverside, <name type="place">Illinois</name>, on the Des Plaines River 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) west of <name type="place">Chicago</name> and accessible to commuters by train, Olm-<lb/>
sted and Vaux had the chance to employ their princi-<lb/>
ples for laying out residential communities (fig. 9.47). Here was an opportunity to demonstrate on 1,600 acres of farmland the truly metropolitan character of their vision, which was far different from Downing's merely suburban ideal. In doing so, they went beyond the explicit commission of the Riverside Improve-<lb/>
ment Company to design a parkway connecting city and suburb. They wanted to create a transportation alternative to the railroad, providing a recreational amenity not only for Riverside families, but also for carriage-owning <name type="place">Chicago</name> residents who wanted a pleasant outing in the countryside. Like the <name type="place">Brook-<lb/>
lyn</name> parkways, the <name type="place">Chicago</name> parkway&#x2014;several miles of which were constructed&#x2014;had segregated lanes, with pedestrians and horseback riders occupying the lane next to the central roadway and carts and wag-<lb/>
ons the outside utility lane.</p>
<p>For the circulation system within the commu-<lb/>
nity, the designers created curving, well-drained, tree-<lb/>
lined roads with sidewalks bordering lawns, which they specified to be 30 feet (9.1 meters) deep and planted with at least two trees. Like a <name type="place">New England</name> town, Riverside had its common. There were, more-<lb/>
over, because of the configuration of the road sys-<lb/>
tem, many triangular pieces of land that were intentionally exempted from the process of parceling house lots, and these served as additional public green space. But the largest reservation of land for common recreational enjoyment was the 160-acre stretch of land paralleling the Des Plaines River, envisioned as a waterfront park.</p>
<p>Management difficulties and financial problems made the partners resign their commission in <date when="1870">1870</date>. A thousand acres east of the river and a small piece of land to the west were eventually developed accord-<lb/>
ing to their plan, but many half-acre lots were divided into two lots, and the large park remained unbuilt. Today, however, this leafy suburb, which is now sur-<lb/>
rounded by ordinary grid-style urbanization, stands out as an example of the intelligent approach to the design of the new American metropolitan landscape in the middle of the nineteenth century when Olm-<lb/>
sted and Vaux infused the process of real-estate devel-<lb/>
opment with social and recreational considerations of lasting consequence.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Chicago Parks</hi></hi></head>
<p>At the same time that the partners were working on Riverside, <name type="place">Chicago</name> was becoming a commercial dynamo vigorously seeking the civic symbolism that would assert its supremacy within the Union. The state legislature had recently passed a bill authorizing the creation of three large parks, two of which had received approval in a voters' referendum. Separate commissions were created to oversee each park, a fact that served to prevent the comprehensive urban plan-<lb/>
ning approach taken in Buffalo.</p>
<p><name type="pname">William LeBaron Jenny</name>, a French-trained archi-<lb/>
tect, was chosen to design the western recreational complex consisting of Douglas Park and Garfield (originally Central) Park, while Olmsted and Vaux were hired to design the united <name type="place">Washington</name> Park and Jackson Park for the South Park Commission (fig. 9.48). Unfortunately, the fire of <date when="1871">1871</date>, which destroyed much of <name type="place">Chicago</name>, prevented the construction of these parks from moving forward at the time. Even if begun, the parks on the South Park Commission's flat, unpromising site adjacent to Lake Michigan offered little opportunity for realizing Olmsted and Vaux's ideal scenery of rolling meadowland. In addi-<lb/>
tion, because <name type="place">Chicago</name> had a district-based rather than a city-wide park system, the designers were called upon to fit more elements into their plan for the two parks than would have been the case had they been able to adopt an integrated metropolitan approach,
<pb n="349"/>
<pb n="349" type="orig"/>
assigning different recreational functions more broadly to a greater number of parks.</p>
<p>But Lake Michigan itself in their opinion com-<lb/>
pensated "for the absence of sublime or picturesque elevations of the land."<ref target="#CH9-n36"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">36</hi></hi></ref>To extend its scenic influ-<lb/>
ence and also to provide good drainage of the Mid-<lb/>
way and <name type="place">Washington</name> Park, they planned a 165-acre lagoon in Jackson Park. Because the designers thought that most park visitors would arrive by boat on the lakeside, an inlet and adjacent 200-foot (61-meter) pier formed the principal entrance to South Park. In inland <name type="place">Washington</name> Park, they found an opportunity for the creation of a large open meadow, which they called Southopen Green. The two parks were united by the Midway Plaisance,<ref target="#CH9-n37">37</ref>a linear band of lawns and shrub-<lb/>
bery with a central canal that connected the water from the "mere" in <name type="place">Washington</name> Park with that of the Lagoon in Jackson Park. Defying the harsh lakefront climate, Olmsted saw the Lagoon as an opportunity to create an approximation of the tropical scenery he had admired on his travels in Louisana, thus com-<lb/>
bining "the fresh and healthy nature of the North with the restful, dreamy nature of the South."<ref target="#CH9-n38"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">38</hi></hi></ref>Not until twenty years later, when he was summoned to be the landscape design member of the planning team for the <name type="place">Chicago</name> World's Fair of <date when="1893">1893</date> on the site of Jackson and <name type="place">Washington</name> parks, did he have a chance to implement this and other elements of the design he had produced with Vaux.</p>
<p>This project was the last the two men designed together, for in <date when="1872">1872</date>, for reasons of mutual conven-<lb/>
ience, they dissolved their partnership. Vaux contin-<lb/>
ued his career as a gifted practitioner of Romantic Ruskinian architecture until the vogue for Beaux-Arts Neoclassicism eclipsed the Picturesque style toward the end of the century. Olmsted, now fully confirmed in his own mind as a landscape architect, created a new firm in which he was joined first by his adopted stepson, John Charles Olmsted, and later by his son, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.</p>

The two men disagreed about ways to plant the public parkland next to the Arboretum in Brookline. Sargent, the botanist, favored a taxonomic approach and the use of native plants only, while Olmsted, the artist, felt that including exotic plants would enhance the effects of light and shade, gradations of color, contrasts in texture, and compositional arrangement of forms he envisioned. Olmsted, who saw botanical display as a perversion of the principles of park making, which he felt should always be directed toward creating broad stretches of naturalistic scenery, ironically found himself advocating a more diverse botanical palette than that of the professional botanist.</p> 
<p>In 500-acre Franklin Park, considered by Olm-<lb/>
sted to be the principal jewel, where the natural ter-<lb/>
rain of West Roxbury gave him the opportunity to create a broad rolling meadow and a grade-separated circulation system that allowed pedestrians to approach it through handsome rustic arches, he achieved a good approximation of his scenic park ideal (figs. 9.50, 9.51). Now, in <date when="1884">1884</date>, with Vaux no longer at his side, he built these of natural stone boulders instead of the dressed and carved stone that made his former partner's arches in Central Park and Prospect Park works of ornamental architecture. Here the meadow was also conceived as a baseball field, with boulders for bleachers and a rustic changing area nearby. This is an early instance of sports permitted on an Olmsted park meadow, a harbinger of the future transformation by others in much less sensitive design terms of many existing Olmsted lawns and meadows into spaces for organized recreation.</p>

<p>While Olmsted still nominally held the title of con-<lb/>
sulting landscape architect to the Parks Department, he was thoroughly disgusted by <name type="place">New York</name>'s political milieu, so in <date when="1881">1881</date>, he transferred his office and home to Brookline, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>. His friend and neigh-<lb/>
bor there was the noted architect Henry Hobson Richardson (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886">1886</date>), and during the five years before Richardson's death, the two had several oppor-<lb/>
tunities for intensely sympathetic collaboration, in which Richardson's neo-Romanesque yet original style encouraged Olmsted's increasing boldness in the use of boulders and rough fieldstone. Olmsted still harbored a penchant for trailing vines and found the combination of these and massive rustic stone walls pleasing.</p>

<p>At Moraine Farm, the estate of John C. Phillips in Beverly, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, on the banks of Wenham Great Pond, he had the opportunity to design a 275-<lb/>
acre American version of a <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> where a beau-<lb/>
tiful hayfield with clumps of deciduous and evergreen trees at the edges performed the same aesthetic func-<lb/>
tion as the Long Meadow in Prospect Park (fig. 9.52). Here, on the east side of the house designed by the Bostonian architects Peabody and Stearns and over-<lb/>
looking the pond, he built a long sinuous terrace banked by a retaining wall of natural boulders, beneath which masses of laurel and rhododendron cascade down to the edge of the water (fig. 9.53).</p>
<p>Olmsted was now the undisputed leader in the profession of landscape architecture in <name type="place">America</name>. His services were heavily in demand, and he found him-<lb/>
self traveling back and forth across the country by train to serve a wide clientele, designing park systems for Rochester, <name type="place">New York</name>, and Louisville, Kentucky In <date when="1879">1879</date>, he assisted in preparing the report that led in <date when="1885">1885</date> to the scenic preservation of Niagara and of the abundant botanical diversity of Goat Island between the American and Canadian Falls. He and Vaux teamed up again to develop an environmentally sen-<lb/>
sitive plan that would allow visitors to fully appreci-<lb/>
ate this scenic wonder without the distraction of tawdry commercial development.</p>
<p>With his young partner, Charles Eliot, Olmsted was able to extend the concept of <name type="place">Boston</name>'s municipal park system to a broad metropolitan scale. Eliot, the son of the president of Harvard, was instrumental in forming the Trustees of Public Reservations (now known as the Trustees of Reservations), an early example of a conservation organization dedicated to preserving wilderness areas in <name type="place">New England</name>. In addi-<lb/>
tion to small publicly accessible properties held by the Trustees, Eliot envisioned large reservations in the public domain, for which a metropolitan commission was needed. He worked tirelessly with Sylvester Bax-<lb/>
ter, a writer turned regional planner, to develop polit-<lb/>
ical consensus among the communities within and the jurisdictions outside the boundaries of the munic-<lb/>
ipality of <name type="place">Boston</name> for a Metropolitan District to acquire and improve parkland within a 10-mile (16.1-kilome-<lb/>
ter) radius of the city. Their survey of the area took in the islands in the harbor, beaches, forests, three river basins, several hills, five ponds, and other sites they found desirable as nature preserves or suitable for pub-<lb/>
lic recreation.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Board of Metropolitan Park Commission-<lb/>
ers appointed under the <date when="1892">1892</date> act was created to a large degree as a result of their work. This Board read the Eliot-Baxter report and plan, which was published the following year. In it, Baxter outlined their recom-<lb/>
mendations for restoring tree cover, guiding real-estate development, reducing water pollution, making trans-<lb/>
portation accessible, and designing small local community playgrounds. Eliot's report, with accom-<lb/>
panying maps and diagrams, summarized the area's physical and historical geography and described the opportunities awaiting the commission's subsequent actions in the well-watered and hilly glaciated terrain of metropolitan <name type="place">Boston</name>. Thus, as he neared the end of his active professional career, Olmsted was able to rejoice in the success of his young prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; in carry-<lb/>
ing forward his own peculiarly American mission of promoting civilization through landscape preserva-<lb/>
tion. Tragically, Eliot's life was cut short by death only four years later. In addition, there were new forces at work in American society, seeking to promote civi-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Olmsted in a Neoclassical Context</hi></hi></head>
<p>The movement to shape cities according to the mon-<lb/>
umental model provided by <name type="place">Paris</name> and other European capitals emerged from the generation of architects after Vaux, who trained abroad in a variety of Neo-<lb/>
classical styles derived from the French Renaissance and its Italian models. These younger men converted some of the nation's growing industrial wealth into mansions for the wealthy and civic grandeur for the public at large. Among these was Richard Morris Hunt (<date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">1895</date>), the first American of renown to design in the style called Beaux-Arts after the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts in <name type="place">Paris</name> where a number of aspiring architects from the United States went to study in the second half of the nineteenth century. Olmsted and Vaux were not happy when a newly formed Com-<lb/>
mittee on Statuary, Fountains and Architectural Struc-<lb/>
tures invited Hunt to propose alterations to the Arsenal in Central Park in <date when="1860">1860</date>; the Civil War caused these plans to be shelved for the duration. More upset-<lb/>
ting was Hunt's proposal, drawn up at the commit-<lb/>
tee's request, for a series of monumental Neoclassical gateways at the park's four southern entrances. Vaux's
<pb n="352"/>
<pb n="352" type="orig"/>
opposition persuaded the park commissioners not to construct these monumental entrances.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-427">
<graphic url="CH9_055.jpg"/>
<figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.54. U.S. Capitol, Terrace on the west front, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. <date when="1873">1873</date></hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>Olmsted felt that statuary in the park should be confined to the Mall and Bethesda Terrace, and he expressed his fear of other monumental Beaux-Arts architectural encroachments by Hunt on the park's pastoral landscape. Nevertheless, Olmsted was able to work within the context of a Neoclassical design vocabulary when necessary. In <date when="1873">1873</date>, he accepted the commission of the Senate Committee on Buildings and Grounds to design the 46 acres around the United States Capitol in <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name> In this case, it was obviously necessary to ignore his precept of fitting buildings inconspicuously into the landscape, as the chief purpose of the project was to heighten the monumentality and dignity of the nation's most important public building. In addition to banning Gardenesque effects, which he considered fussy dis-<lb/>
tractions from this principal object, he built the mas-<lb/>
sive terrace that forms a podium along the Capitol's north, south, and west sides and unifies the building with its surroundings (fig. 9.54).</p>
<p>In the two final commissions of his career, Olm-<lb/>
sted worked directly with Beaux-Arts architects. In <date when="1888">1888</date>, twenty-five-year-old George <name type="place">Washington</name> Van-<lb/>
derbilt commissioned him to design the grounds at Biltmore, his estate near Asheville, North Carolina. Here Hunt was the architect of a palatial mansion resembling a French Renaissance <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau.</hi> Olmsted's plan encompassed 2,000 acres of mountainous land-<lb/>
scape. Inasmuch as the site did not lend itself to becoming a park in the pastoral and Picturesque tra-<lb/>
dition, Olmsted recommended that Vanderbilt should devote most of it to scientific forestry. The million-<lb/>
aire eventually increased his holdings to 120,000 acres and hired America's first professional forester, Gifford Pinchot, who later became the founding head of the United States Forest Service. Olmsted also convinced Vanderbilt to create an arboretum.</p>
<p>At Biltmore, Olmsted's particular genius as a landscape designer expressed itself in the estate's road system: a 3-mile (4.8-kilometer) approach road, the borders of which he enhanced with "varied forms of vegetation... all consistent with the sensation of pass-<lb/>
ing through the remote depths of a natural forest."<ref target="#CH9-n40"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">40</hi></hi></ref>Here, as in Central Park and elsewhere, he wanted to plant lush masses of many species of rhododendron and a rich variety of other woodland shrubs in order to create the "sense of the superabundant creative power, infinite resource, and liberality of Nature"<ref target="#CH9-n41"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">41</hi></hi></ref>that tropical scenery had always evoked in him. The long approach road at last brings the visitor, who has had no anticipatory view of what lies ahead, to a rec-<lb/>
tangular grassy esplanade, beyond which Hunt's immense <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> of Indiana limestone looms sud-<lb/>
denly into view. At Moraine Farm, the view of the lake was not revealed until one passed through the house onto the terrace overlooking it; so, too, at Bilt-<lb/>
more, Olmsted withheld the panoramic scenery of the Great Smokies with Mount Pisgah in the distance until one had passed through the house onto the ter-<lb/>
race there. Thus, although more architecturally elab-<lb/>
orate than the rustic terrace built earlier in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, the terrace at Biltmore serves the same purpose as a viewing platform for a heretofore con-<lb/>
cealed spectacle of nature at its most glorious.</p>
<p>At the same time that he worked at Biltmore, Olmsted became a member of the design team, headed by the architect <name type="pname">Daniel H. Burnham</name>, that was planning the World's Columbian Exposition of <date when="1893">1893</date> for <name type="place">Chicago</name>. This World's Fair, like the expositions organized first in <name type="place">England</name> and then in <name type="place">Paris</name> in the sec-<lb/>
ond half of the nineteenth century, was intended as an international showcase of the products of industry. But unlike the earlier fairs, which had produced tech-<lb/>
nologically innovative structures&#x2014;notably the Crys-<lb/>
tal Palace and the Eiffel Tower&#x2014;Burnham and his Beaux-Arts-trained colleagues wished to put the archi-<lb/>
tectural stamp of Neoclassical grandeur, rather than of modernity, upon this one. Olmsted was consulted on site selection and, with the assistance of his tal-<lb/>
ented young prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; and partner Henry Sargent Cod-<lb/>
man, chose the still-unimproved site of Jackson Park. This gave him an opportunity to revisit the <date when="1871">1871</date> design he had prepared in partnership with Vaux. Now, however, it was necessary to adopt a much more pronounced orientation toward "gregarious" recreation, with the further understanding that, as at the United States Capitol, the grounds would show-<lb/>
case the buildings. The large lagoon he had planned twenty years earlier was still possible and desirable if
<pb n="353"/>
<pb n="353" type="orig"/>
it were treated as a series of waterbodies, some of which were to be given a geometric architectural treatment to complement the buildings. With their uniform cornice lines and white color, the largest of these made an impressive grouping around Olmsted's most conspicuous water feature, a long central basin with a canal leading to other parts of the lagoon sys-<lb/>
tem, each of which served as a watery foreground for another composition of fair buildings (fig. 9.55).</p>
<p>Still, Olmsted found an opportunity to provide relief from the noisy crowds and architectural grandil-<lb/>
oquence of the fair in the wooded island in the cen-<lb/>
ter of the lagoon. There he tried within the short growing period before opening day to create an air of poetic mystery and the appearance of a natural bayou by establishing a rich aquatic vegetation and dense shoreline growth (fig. 9.56). Here, fair visitors could find a ramble of sinuous paths and the illusion of nature in the midst of the hubbub and excitement of the fair. Olmsted wished to keep the island free of structures, protesting when a music hall was con-<lb/>
templated in that location. Praising the achievement of the <name type="place">Chicago</name> World's Fair as the grounds were being completed, the writer on architecture, gardens, and landscape design, Mariana Griswold Van Rens-<lb/>
selaer, told future visitors, "You will already know that much of the ground immediately beneath you was not even solid, ugly prairie, but treacherous marsh. And looking over this ground now&#x2014;here with its straight, stately, wide canals and architectonic terraces, and there with its irregularly-shaped lagoons and islands&#x2014;you will understand how a great artist like <name type="pname">Mr. Olmsted</name> can absolutely create in a way which almost equals Nature's own."<ref target="#CH9-n42"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">42</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Olmsted, overworked and ailing, was now called upon to add his influential voice to those oppos-<lb/>
ing a speedway in Central Park, one of many pro-<lb/>
posed encroachments over the years. A six-month holiday abroad with his daughter and son for the pur-<lb/>
pose of regaining his health gave him the opportu-<lb/>
nity to revisit with renewed delight the English countryside he had first admired as a young man. At the same time, he deplored the contemporary Victo-<lb/>
rian obsession with horticulture. As we shall read in Chapter Eleven, a controversy was raging between Sir Reginald Blomfield, author of <hi rend="italic">The Formal Garden in <name type="place">England</name></hi> and proponent of a return to geometrical
<pb n="354"/>
<pb n="354" type="orig"/>
planning principles, and William Robinson, the ardent foe of topiary and ornamental floral bedding-out and prolific author of <hi rend="italic">The English Flower Garden, The Wild Garden,</hi> and other books and articles championing herbaceous borders artfully composed of casually intermingled perennial plants. Although the trailing vines recommended by Robinson exactly suited Olm-<lb/>
sted's taste and he found <hi rend="italic">The Wild Garden</hi> useful in selecting plants for such places as the Ramble in Cen-<lb/>
tral Park, he was now more convinced than ever that he had been right to take what was useful from the writings of Gilpin and Price and to have developed an American landscape style emphasizing broad, over-<lb/>
arching scenic themes. He even made a pilgrimage to the church at Boldre where Gilpin had been vicar, and he traveled along the route beside the river Wye that Gilpin had described in one of his books. Visiting <name type="place">Paris</name>, where he examined the grounds of the exposi-<lb/>
tion of <date when="1889">1889</date>, he hoped that in <name type="place">Chicago</name> the "petty effects and frippery" of ornamental floral display would be avoided. He admired, however, the "fitness for their purposes" of the buildings left in the wake of the <name type="place">Paris</name> fair and expressed reservation about those of the White City, as people called the collection of temporary buildings made of staff&#x2014;plaster and fiber laid over timber forms&#x2014;then rising on the shores of Lake Michigan. He hoped that the <name type="place">Chicago</name> buildings were "not going to look too assuming of architectural stateliness and to be overloaded with sculptural and other efforts for grandeur and grandiloquentpomp."<ref target="#CH9-n43"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">43</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>But for now, thanks to the influence of the <name type="place">Chicago</name> World's Fair, the field belonged to Daniel Burnham and other Beaux-Arts practitioners. The achievements of Calvert Vaux were overshadowed by these architects, and the former partners' belief in the overriding therapeutic and spiritual values of natu-<lb/>
ralistic landscapes in an urban setting was denied by the Gilded Age's desire for monumental grandeur. While he still held the position of landscape architect to the board in charge of <name type="place">New York</name> City parks, Vaux had protested against the design of a speedway planned now for the edge of the Harlem River, but his objections were high-handedly brushed aside, and he died under mysterious circumstances in <date when="1895">1895</date>. Olmsted fell victim to dementia, retired from public life, and was confined during the five years preceding his death in <date when="1903">1903</date> in the McLean Hospital at Waverly, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, where he had designed the grounds. But before his intellectual powers were eclipsed, he had seen clearly that the Beaux-Arts architects' appetite for monumentality was antithetical to the older ideal of a republican <name type="place">America</name> that he and Vaux had tried to embody in their parks.</p>
<p>In <date when="1894">1894</date>, Stanford White (<date when="1853">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1906">1906</date>), the most fashionable Beaux Arts architect in the generation after Hunt, was approached to build a tennis house in Prospect Park.

Helmle</name> (<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x2013;<date when="1939">1939</date>), also the architect in <date when="1905">1905</date> of the Prospect Park Boathouse (fig. 9.57). Designed after the Library of St. Mark in <name type="place">Venice</name> by Jacopo d'Antonio Tatti, called Sansovino (<date when="1486">1486</date>&#x2013;<date when="1570">1570</date>), the Boathouse, though handsome in its own right like the Tennis House, is alien to the spirit
<pb n="355"/>
<pb n="355" type="orig"/>
of the park's rustic and rural-seeming landscape. Fur-<lb/>
ther aggrandizing what was intended to be a pastoral refuge from city life, the firm of McKim, Mead and White carried out in Prospect Park what Hunt had failed to do in Central Park. Here they erected three monumental Neoclassical entrances (fig. 9.58). Not unreasonably, Olmsted felt that White and his Beaux Arts colleagues were "trying to establish the rule of motives that are at war with those that ruled in the original laying out of <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> Park."<ref target="#CH9-n44"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">44</hi></hi></ref>All the same, instructed by <name type="place">France</name>, American tastemakers of the time were committed to the values of opulence expressed by the later term denoting the period as the Gilded Age, and the emulation of Europen urban grandeur was well established as a dominant motive underlying civic beautification. Instructed by <name type="place">France</name> in another regard as well, they were also embarked on a course of Industrial Age urban modernity.</p>

<note xml:id="CH09-n15" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="bold">15.</hi></seg><p> As the garden historian John Dixon Hunt points out, <name type="pname">John Claudius Loudon</name> was the first to apply the term <hi rend="italic">landscape architec-<lb/>
ture</hi> to the work of landscape designers. In <date when="1840">1840</date>, Loudon republished Repton's <hi rend="italic">Obser-<lb/>
vations on the Theory and Practice of Land-<lb/>
scape Gardening</hi> (<date when="1803">1803</date>) under the title <hi rend="italic">The Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphrey Repton.</hi> See Hunt, <hi rend="italic">Greater Perfections</hi> (<name type="place">Philadel-<lb/>
phia</name>: University of Pennsylvania Press, <date when="1999">1999</date>), p. 217. But neither Repton nor Loudon after him seems to have employed the term in presenting themselves to clients. Repton had christened himself "Landscape Gar-<lb/>
dener" upon entering professional practice, and Loudon considered himself to be pri-<lb/>
marily an agronomist, botanist, horticultur-<lb/>
alist, and author. Olmsted and Vaux wished to distinguish between their kind of work&#x2014; which often involved extensive engineer-<lb/>
ing and significant reformation of the land to produce a naturalistic effect akin to that of rural scenery&#x2014;and Loudon's kind of ornamental horticulture and that of Repton late in his career when he deemed appro-<lb/>
priate a Gardenesque treatment in areas adjacent to the house. Nevertheless, the notion that they were <hi rend="italic">artists,</hi> not simply engineers or administrators, was important to them. In discussing the use of the title with Olmsted, who apparently objected to it as being too vague, Vaux said as they were about to reenter partnership in <date when="1865">1865</date>, "I have always liked the title Landscape Architect because&#x2014;the specialty was fairly embod-<lb/>
ied. A title that could as easily be trans-<lb/>
ferred to an inartistic public work is not as satisfactory.... The term Landscape Archi-<lb/>
tect does not suit you, well I am sorry for it. I think it is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> title. We want to set art ahead and make it <hi rend="italic">command</hi> its position, admin-<lb/>
istration, management, funds, commission, popularity and everything else&#x2014;then we have a tangible something to stand on." (See <name type="pname">Charles C. McLaughlin</name> <hi rend="italic">et al. The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted,</hi> vol. V, pp.

sodic about his first encounter with the English landscape. He continues, with details of sensory appreciation, describing a scene that might have been a painting by Constable: "We stood dumb-stricken by its loveliness, as, from the bleak April and bare boughs we had left at home, broke upon us that English May&#x2014;sunny, leafy, blooming May&#x2014;in an English lane; with hedges, English hedges, hawthorn hedges, all in blossom; homely old farm-houses, quaint stables, and haystacks; the old church spire over the distant trees; the mild sun beam-<lb/>

<p>The force that has driven modernism and postmodernism as much as the cultural currents and countercurrents running through them&#x2014;the force that has informed all philosophy, politics, eco-<lb/>
nomics, sociology, and art since the last half of the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury&#x2014;is machine technology.<ref target="#CH10-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>It has injected into human culture unprecedented elements of power and speed, which have greatly accelerated the pace of change as well as the pace of life. Machine technology has offered innumerable benefits, and it has also focused attention on the processes of production rather than on its ends.</p>
<p>In examining designed landscapes of the past 150 years, we must continually reckon with their technological infrastructures and the extent to which they are informed by a machine-age men-<lb/>
tality. This is true even when they were created to express opposi-<lb/>
tion to the Industrial Age. Machine technology and human attitudes toward the machine&#x2014;whether celebratory, ambivalent, or con-<lb/>
demnatory&#x2014;provide an ineluctable cultural context that has pow-<lb/>
erfully shaped landscape design in modern times.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century was, generally speaking, an optimistic age. It is true that the enormous stresses associated with acceler-<lb/>
ating scientific discovery, which increasingly undermined religious conviction, and even faith, in the purpose of the rationalist scien-<lb/>
tific enterprise itself, created a sense of unease. Emerson may have darkly intuited the consequences of runaway technology when he complained that "things are in the saddle and ride mankind," but his transcendentalist philosophy nevertheless envisioned nature as a positive, spiritually nourishing force, and he shared with other early witnesses to the Industrial Age the sanguine hope that moder-<lb/>
nity would prove beneficial to humankind.</p>
<p>In our discussion of Goethe's important insights into the dynamics of Romantic culture in the eighteenth century, we saw his attempt to reconcile its tenets with those of classicism as well as his conviction, caustically expressed by Mephistopheles, that pan-<lb/>
theistic worship of nature and spiritual seduction by its idyllic charms deflected human potential from its full expression. In <hi rend="italic">Faust: Part II,</hi> written between <date when="1825">1825</date> and <date when="1831">1831</date>, Goethe sensed the new sources of physical and human energy that were being released by the Industrial Revolution. Ties with history, both personal and soci-<lb/>
etal, had to be severed if <hi rend="italic">progress</hi>&#x2014;the watchword of industrial cap-<lb/>
italism&#x2014;was to occur. Faust, having destroyed his love, Gretchen, in Part I because he could no longer inhabit the traditional society she represents, is offered in Part II an intoxicant more potent than sex or even love: power. This is not the power of kings, but rather the power of industrial progress. It implies the right to challenge nature and alter culture for socially beneficial ends.</p>
<p>In Part II, Faust assumes the role of Nietzsche's Superman, becoming a developer capable of confronting mighty natural forces and traditional folkways and settlement patterns in the act of build-<lb/>
ing and destroying. His vision is that of the engineer; he will har-<lb/>
ness capital and labor for a giant coastal reclamation project, erecting dams and digging canals, "To hold the lordly ocean from the shore/To set the watery waste new boundary lines," in order to create a dynamic new economy for the ultimate benefit of humankind. As in the American myth of Paul Bunyan, the intrepid pioneers who assist Faust in this mighty work are emigrants from Gretchen's Old World of familiar and constrained village life. In the process of their labor, they are enlarged; they become bold actors in the heroic drama of conquering and subduing nature.</p>
<p>Goethe foresaw the Industrial Age and the social freedom it would engender, but he also saw the tragic implications of its often inhuman disregard of people's lives. There was a price to be paid for economic efficiency in terms of physical and emotional disloca-<lb/>
tion. Not only did human life become less laborious with the advent of industrialization, it also became more impersonal. The rural round gave way to urbanism and a culture based on new concepts
<pb n="358"/>
<pb n="358" type="orig"/>
of time and space. People were no longer tied to the pastoral rhythms of the seasons or boundaries of daily movement circum-<lb/>
scribed by wind-filled sails, the stamina of horses, and human walk-<lb/>
ing distances. Movement is one of the imperatives of power. Machine-facilitated personal mobility and speed are among mod-<lb/>
ernism's premier values. There is a hurried character to modern times that distinguishes them from any other age.</p>
<p>Rapid change is another hallmark of modernity. Faust can no longer go back to the wellspring of childhood but is doomed to rest-<lb/>
less forward motion, forever set upon the course of modernity with its unending cycles of change in which only novelty and invention hold meaning. The paradox of power is that everything is provi-<lb/>
sional, in flux; progress depends upon the willing and unsentimen-<lb/>
tal sacrifice of what has gone before, for each new development will inevitably be discredited.</p>
<p>Cities, especially, became increasingly machinelike in appear-<lb/>
ance, and the nature of everyday life was irreversibly altered as eas-<lb/>
ily purchased, mass-produced commodities and new building technologies made it possible to discard, replace, and improve the old or obsolete. No longer was the built environment the result of the muscular labor of humans and animals, and no longer were the articles of daily life&#x2014;pots and pans, tools and utensils, carriages and wagons, clothing and furniture&#x2014; crafted by hand. More peo-<lb/>
ple now lived in structures erected with the aid of machinery and consisting of many machine-made parts, cooked with factory-built appliances, ate their meals on factory wares, dressed in industrially produced clothing, and purchased inexpensive mass-produced clocks to help them fit their daily routine to industrial work hours and transportation schedules. A new temporal commodity, leisure, one of the outcomes of the regimented industrial work week, made possible new forms of recreation with important consequences for landscape design.</p>
<p>To accommodate large-scale population growth in the second half of the nineteenth century, major cities&#x2014;notably, <name type="place">Paris</name>, <name type="place">Lon-<lb/>
don</name>, and Vienna&#x2014;began to alter urban form through industrial technology, creating new transportation arteries to accelerate vehic-<lb/>
ular movement and employing new kinds of materials and engi-<lb/>
neering solutions to increase building scale and extend the range of construction possibilities. Old royal parks were opened to the pub-<lb/>
lic, and new people's parks were created as recreational leisure became for middle and working classes alike an antidote to machine-<lb/>
age urban stress and as increased leisure became one of the fruits of mechanization. Because military tactics now rendered such urban defenses completely obsolete, ancient walls continued to be torn down and the land they had occupied turned into wide boulevards. Thus ungirdled, the growing city also became more porous; dense old neighborhoods were now penetrated by the straight new thor-<lb/>
oughfares designed to facilitate movement and commerce.</p>
<p>The changes revealed different classes of people to one another as enigmatic, but interesting, strangers. The curious tried to imagine these others' lives. Baudelaire, the poet supremely aware of <name type="place">Paris</name> in transition, writes of the "ant-seething city, city full of dreams," affirming a new and terrible kind of beauty found "in sin-<lb/>
uous folds of cities old and grim, where all things, even horror, turn to grace" as he observed the perplexed valor of the denizens of Old <name type="place">Paris</name> in the face of so much tremendous change. The epitome of the <hi rend="italic">fl&#x00E2;neur,</hi> he wrote poems about crones and coquettes, the soul-<lb/>
penetrating glances of strangers, the lives hitherto hidden from view and now exposed, all simultaneously occurring as rich and poor moved and mingled anonymously in the new urban milieu. There was something both frightening and thrilling in the possi-<lb/>
bility of these fleeting encounters.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitan urbanism implied a rejection of tradition. Like Faust, one was prepared to sacrifice past attachments and even moral scruples for technique, expediency, and efficiency as well as for intellectual adventure, sensory experience, and artistic self-<lb/>
expression. Personal experience came to be seen as a form of wealth, encouraging people to push to the limits of their abilities, energy, capital resources, and available time as they attempted to turn the material world to increasing advantage. Thus had the forces of Romanticism, nurtured by Rousseau's philosophy, proclaimed new moral autonomy for the individual.</p>
<p>The philosopher Immanuel Kant (<date when="1724">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804">1804</date>), though cer-<lb/>
tainly no Romantic of the <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> school, had above his desk a picture of Rousseau. Kant believed passionately in the unfet-<lb/>
tered human will and the individual's right to choose a personal course of moral action. He was therefore sympathetic to the tenets of the American and French Revolutions&#x2014;at least before the Reign of Terror repressively stifled diversity of political opinion in France&#x2014;because these great public manifestations of Romanti-<lb/>
cism vested authority not in a monarch, however benevolent, but in the people. Human beings, in Kant's view, were not to be con-<lb/>
sidered as passive creatures in a world where everything was pre-<lb/>
ordained by God, natural science, and inherited systems of government. Kant took the position that the human mind bestows upon the universe a sense of order. This was quite different from the attitude of earlier philosophers such as Descartes or Aristotle, who thought of the mind as an instrument for discerning the estab-<lb/>
lished order of the universe by empirical means. The powerful intel-<lb/>
lectual and moral freedom granted individuals by Kantian philosophy was paralleled by the rising tide of democratization among nation-states and the attempt to create human environ-<lb/>
ments through political processes involving governmental machin-<lb/>
ery designed for collective decision making.</p>
<p>In this light we may observe how, beginning in the eighteenth century and accelerating with the French Revolution, cities became increasingly the domain of the people, their form no longer dic-<lb/>
tated by royal policy and aristocratic privilege even when, as in the case of Second Empire <name type="place">Paris</name>, their transformation was accom-<lb/>
plished by imperial fiat and state authority. As old cities were being torn apart and their social contents rendered visible, there arose a new political awareness, which was nourished by broad readership of daily newspapers sold on the street. The streets that were designed as a deterrent to revolutionary mobs and as parade routes where marching bands elicited emotions of patriotic pride were also upon occasion the arenas of violent social protest. Ordinarily, however, they served as the lively theater of daily life as increasing numbers of people perambulated and an ever-growing segment of society was able to purchase the growing quantities of factory-pro-<lb/>
duced merchandise appearing in shop windows.</p>

<p><name type="place">Paris</name>, the first avowedly modern city, not only stimulated a great surge of strolling in its new boulevards but also pro-<lb/>
vided parks as special places where leisure could be spent. In the works of the Impressionists when the city is their subject we may observe the pleased wonder with which Parisians embraced the transformations that were occurring (fig. 10.1). Intimate emotions were no longer veiled from view; in the industrial city personal and public life had become fused into one. The con-<lb/>
stant movement in the streets, with the opportunities for peo-<lb/>
ple-watching and serendipitous sociability thus provided, and the display of commodities and luxury goods in sidewalk stalls and behind plate glass windows made them intensely interesting. Sud-<lb/>
denly all was in motion, and all had become a source of spectacle and excitement. Everything, even&#x2014;or perhaps especially&#x2014;one-<lb/>
self, was on display.</p>

<p>The notion of the city as an object of formal presentation and symbolical representation, an architectural artifact enjoying the pres-<lb/>
tige formerly accorded the court, an urban organism to be concep-<lb/>
tualized in its entirety and ornamented proudly was an eighteenth-century phenomenon. The St. Petersburg of Peter the Great and <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, the federal capital Pierre L'Enfant planned for the new United States, were monumental cities built according to these intentions (see figs. 6.44,6.54). The intentions of founders, however, are often disregarded by subsequent generations and most cities in any case are conceived pragmatically rather than grandly, as serviceable places for conducting business and meeting the needs of daily life. Nevertheless, prosperity breeds philanthropy, civic pride, and the desire to emulate what is deemed best. Such was the case in Gilded Age <name type="place">America</name>, the period following the Civil War when most cities built their major cultural institutions and parks. The "White City" that rose on the banks of Lake Michigan in <date when="1893">1893</date> set the course of architecture and urban planning firmly in the direc-<lb/>
tion of monumental grandeur. Like Haussmann's <name type="place">Paris</name>, which cov-<lb/>
ered its new Industrial Age infrastructure with a neoclassical architectural veneer, the American city with which it was contem-<lb/>
porary now sought to cloak itself with monumental dignity. Not surprisingly, the model for this effort was <name type="place">Paris</name> itself. Architects and landscape architects trained at the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts carried for-<lb/>
ward the tenets of the City Beautiful Movement, a two-decade cam-<lb/>
paign to aggrandize American cities with heroic sculpture, noble architecture, spacious boulevards, and handsome public spaces. Without the backing of a monarchical regime like that of Napoleon III or a powerful public servant such as Haussmann to finance and forcefully administer a large array of coordinated capital construc-<lb/>
tion projects, most City Beautiful plans were only fragmentarily real-<lb/>
ized. In <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, which enjoyed special status as the nation's capital, however, a congressional commission was formed to oversee a comprehen-<lb/>
sive plan, resulting in the clearance of obstructions from the Mall and its realignment and extension, the construction of the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, and the building, after much debate, of a scenic parkway for motorists in the Rock Creek valley.</p>
<p>Machine mobility, which first made cities such as <name type="place">Paris</name> tourist meccas, created new accessibility to sparsely tenanted wild landscapes as well. In <name type="place">Amer-<lb/>
ica</name>, where transcendentalism had been an important philoso-<lb/>
phy in the nineteenth century, the concept of the nation as an Arca-<lb/>
dia persisted even as it continued to be mechanically divided according to the Jeffersonian grid. This ideal was promoted by the United States Congress when, beginning in <date when="1872">1872</date>, it created national parks in areas where there was spectacular natural scenery. These were soon equated in the eyes of many Americans with the cathe-<lb/>
drals and other important historic monuments of Europe as icons of national identity. First railroads and later interstate highways brought vacationers in increasing numbers to these natural sites, now legislatively certified as sacrosanct. Railroad interests were, in fact, deeply and profitably involved in promoting the creation of national parks. Without Industrial Age modes of transportation as a stimulus to mass tourism, there would have been little reason to create the parks in the first place. If the scenic lands encompassed by the parks had remained inaccessible, there would have been no need to protect them from industrial or commercial exploitation, and without means of transportation, their acquisition with tax dollars could not have been justified by a corresponding benefit to the citizenry of the United States. During the first half of the twen-<lb/>
tieth century, when driving for pleasure was perceived as an impor-<lb/>
tant form of recreation, additional public dollars were spent on the creation of parkways and state park systems that permitted urban dwellers to spend a day in the country and enjoy the trip as well.</p>
<p>To understand how the revolution in transportation made the landscape at large accessible and how the modern city became a completely ungirdled entity&#x2014;a phenomenon of motion, an arena of pleasure, and the nexus of a much larger region made accessible both for recreation and residential settlement&#x2014;we must go back 150 years in time to examine the transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name> during the Second Empire of Napoleon III. Haussmann's <name type="place">Paris</name>, however authoritarian in concept and harsh in displacing the poor, was progressive in its attention to middle-class needs. With its con-<lb/>
sideration of transportation, recreation, and sanitation, and the atmosphere of widely shared urban pleasure it produced&#x2014;as glimpsed in the paintings of the Impressionists and through the eyes of the novelist Marcel Proust (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x2013;<date when="1922">1922</date>)&#x2014;it ushered in the era of modern urbanism.</p>

<p>Elected president of the Second Republic in the wake of the defeat of the republican revolutionaries of <date when="1848">1848</date>, Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte&#x2014;known as Napoleon III after he became emperor by a coup d'&#x00E9;tat in <date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2014;returned from exile in <name type="place">England</name> to assume the reins of government. To forestall further revolutionary uprisings, he wanted to tear apart the dense fabric of <name type="place">Paris</name> by creating new avenues. These would divide the city into sectors and isolate the potentially treacherous neighborhoods, making it more difficult for a mob to erect barricades and seize control of the capital in the future. But to think of his twenty-year transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name> sim-<lb/>
ply in political and tactical terms is a mistake. It was primarily a skillful reinvention of the urban form itself through comprehensive city planning and the appli-<lb/>
cation of Industrial Age technology to solving the problems of several types of circulation: water, sewage, trains, carriages, and pedestrians. By this time mass societies had come into existence, and the notion had become prevalent that government bore a fun-<lb/>
damental responsibility for public sanitation, trans-<lb/>
portation routes, and the physical form and condition of the urban framework in general. <hi rend="italic">Urbanisme,</hi> "city planning" in French, was a term coined in the second half of the nineteenth century to denote a techno-<lb/>
cratic approach to shaping cities by regularizing their form and ministering to the needs of their popula-<lb/>
tions through the provision and maintenance of such basic infrastructure systems as streets and street lights, aqueducts, drainage lines, and sewers. The term also encompasses the concept of regulatory administra-<lb/>
tion, that is, planning by means of building codes and land use regulations governing the safety and welfare of the city's inhabitants as well as the aesthetics of the urban ensemble. Because facilitation of movement is a primary objective of the modern city, the measure-<lb/>
ment of transportation volumes and flows and the development of terminals, roadbeds, and tracks to accommodate interurban and intraurban modes of travel are central to the planning process.</p>
<div type="subsection">

<p>The accomplishment of rebuilding <name type="place">Paris</name>, which occurred despite deep misgivings and suffering on the part of many, must be measured in terms of the prob-<lb/>
lems faced by the old urban order. Nineteen thousand residents had died in the cholera epidemic of <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;49. In <date when="1850">1850</date>, the population had grown to 1.3 million; over the next twenty years it continued climbing another 25 percent to reach 1.65 million. There was rampant unemployment and extreme overcrowding. Most of the city was a dense tangle of residential and manu-<lb/>
facturing quarters, unfathomable except to those with long familiarity with its narrow, tortuous medieval streets. Historically redolent and venerably pictur-<lb/>
esque, Old <name type="place">Paris</name> nonetheless glowed in the memo-<lb/>
ries of many Parisians and tourists who continued to mourn, long after they had disappeared, cherished bits and pieces of its vanished cityscape.</p>
<p>The real impetus for reordering the street pat-<lb/>
tern came not from military motives so much as from the impulse of the rapidly expanding industrial capi-<lb/>
talist society to have the mobility it needed to con-<lb/>
duct business. Specifically, the premier machine of the Industrial Age, the steam-powered railroad train, pro-<lb/>
pelled <name type="place">Paris</name> and other cities into the modern age. Tracks penetrated several quarters along the city's urban periphery, large shedlike industrial buildings of iron and glass were built as terminals, and the volume of traffic generated by travelers coming and going necessitated replacing some of the city's welter of crooked streets with broad, straight thoroughfares to connect with destinations in the center.</p>
<p>During the years of his exile in <name type="place">England</name>, Louis-<lb/>
Napoleon had seen some of the developments in transportation, sanitation, and parks that made <name type="place">Lon-<lb/>
don</name> the leader in modernization among European cities. Fortunately for him, he was able to find in <name type="place">France</name> a state administrator precisely suited to carry out an ambitious agenda of public improvements in <name type="place">Paris</name>. Baron Georges-Eug&#x00E8;ne Haussmann (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2014; <date when="1891">1891</date>), whom he appointed prefect of the Department of the Seine, was a government official skilled at manipulating tools that were new at the time, but which are common today: laws enabling the con-<lb/>
demnation and appropriation of private property and debt financing. To justify their actions, the emperor and Haussmann reasoned that improvements in the city's infrastructure and the creation of new and improved public spaces would raise real-estate values and bring higher tax returns with which to pay off the debts incurred. Although Haussmann's financing schemes ran into trouble, leading to his downfall in <date when="1870">1870</date>, the city's course of modernization was by then irrevocably set in the direction in which it continued until World War I.</p>
<p>Haussmann was able to conceptualize the entire city in technological, mechanistic terms as an entity, and although the Second Empire architecture that lined his new boulevards borrowed such time-hon-<lb/>
ored motifs as mansard roofs and sculptural details derived from Baroque classicism, these were merely the decorative trappings of a resolutely technologi-<lb/>
cal approach to construction. Bourgeois financiers provided the money that built the buildings and many
<pb n="361"/>
<pb n="361" type="orig"/>
of the public improvements, and Haussmann's radi-<lb/>
cal transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name> was aimed at making the city not only efficient but also agreeable for this mid-<lb/>
dle class. Before, there had been large <hi rend="italic">hôtels</hi> for aris-<lb/>
tocrats and crowded lodgings for artisans and shopkeepers. Now, with regulations creating uniform cornice lines and roof heights, there were blocks of buildings with spacious apartments for bankers, mer-<lb/>
chants, manufacturers, lawyers, physicians, politicians, and other members of the bourgeoisie. There were also grand new hotels serving a new and transient segment of the population, the tourists who came in increasing numbers. Haussmann's urban framework, moreover, accommodated another invention of cap-<lb/>
italist-consumer society: the department store, an airy palace with an interior skylighted courtyard con-<lb/>
structed of cast iron and glass like the huge sheds built as train depots and like the new wholesale meat and produce market, Les Halles Centrales.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Circulation</hi> is the operative word in understand-<lb/>
ing Haussmann's program for rebuilding <name type="place">Paris</name>. Not only did the growing commercial city need to move people and goods in and out by rail, but it also had to accommodate the many carriages owned by its pros-<lb/>
perous bourgeoisie. In addition, omnibuses began operation in <date when="1855">1855</date>, preceding the <hi rend="italic">M&#x00E9;tro,</hi> built in <date when="1900">1900</date>, as a means of mass transit. Furthermore, if it was to remain healthy, the city needed to transport wastes more efficiently. The recent invention of ferrocon-<lb/>
crete&#x2014;concrete reinforced with metal&#x2014;facilitated the construction of large collector tunnels that were part of a network of sewers planned by Haussmann. These carried the city's drainage northwest away from the built-up urban area to Asni&#x00E8;res, where it was released into the Seine. Because of population growth and pollution of the Seine, Parisians' traditional source of potable water, Haussmann's engineers designed aqueducts to draw copious amounts from the Yonne, Vanne, and Dhuis River valleys.</p>
<p>The character of the city was changed in pro-<lb/>
found ways. Houses formerly faced interior court-<lb/>
yards, but now new block and building plans allowed tall windows to open onto the street. From their bal-<lb/>
conies residents gazed upon the spectacle of carriages and people moving below (fig. 10.2). Large shop win-<lb/>
dows of plate glass created a thin membrane between interior and exterior space; the display of merchan-<lb/>
dise stimulated pedestrian traffic as browsing and buy-<lb/>
ing became popular pastimes, giving birth to the consumer society with its endless dreams of material goods as a basis of the good life. Caf&#x00E9;s catered to the increased movement of people in the new streets, serving as outdoor living rooms where social life became a daily ritual in a city increasingly attracted to pleasure. Gaslight&#x2014;soon to be replaced by elec-<lb/>
tric lighting&#x2014;illuminated streets and the inside of shops and caf&#x00E9;s, while increasing nighttime security and extending the hours people moved abroad in pub-<lb/>
lic. The <hi rend="italic">promeneur</hi> walked the new boulevards for pleasure, while the <hi rend="italic">flaneur</hi> idled away the hours, observing the quotidian dramas that often served as fodder for journalism.</p>

<p>The channels Haussmann cut through the city&#x2014;his <hi rend="italic">percements</hi>&#x2014;and the public buildings erected by the talented architects employed by his Ser-<lb/>
vice des B&#x00E2;timents Civils became the <hi rend="italic">mise-en-sc&#x00E8;ne</hi> for a new kind of public pageantry. The caf&#x00E9;s he planned for every major boulevard intersection were eddies in the current of humanity that flowed through them. The Op&#x00E9;ra, the cultural institution claimed by bour-<lb/>
geois society more completely than any other, assumed the role of social stage played by Versailles two hundred years before. In <date when="1860">1860</date>, <name type="pname">Jean-Louis-Charles Garnier</name> (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898">1898</date>) won the competition to design a magnificent new opera house. The architect con-<lb/>
ceived its grand staircase as a spreading fan of steps to display the train of the Empress Eug&#x00E9;nie's gown, but its real function, as it turned out when the build-<lb/>
ing was completed in <date when="1875">1875</date> during the Third Repub-<lb/>
lic (four years after the fall of Napoleon III), was to display the members of the fashionable world to one another against a backdrop of ruby and gold neo-<lb/>
Baroque splendor. Borrowing here as elsewhere the design vocabulary Le Nôtre had developed for the seventeenth-century French garden, Haussmann placed this opulent landmark as the focal point of one
<pb n="362"/>
<pb n="362" type="orig"/>
of his arrow-straight avenues lined with uniform blocks of new buildings. The whole architectural ensemble served as an ordered and stable counter-<lb/>
point to the surge of movement along the grand, wide thoroughfare. The flow of traffic and the lively character of public life in this new urban space were evident even on a rainy day in <date when="1898">1898</date> when the scene was painted by the Impressionist artist Camille Pis-<lb/>
sarro (fig. 10.3).</p>

</figure>
<p>Movement in, around, and through architec-<lb/>
tural space was Haussmann's primary goal, and the sculptural facades, bell towers, spires, domes, tri-<lb/>
umphal arches, and statues of an earlier age, as well as those of his own, were merely the ornamental and symbolically necessary props for the much grander spectacle of his resolutely modern city. This involved the eradication of much ad hoc urbanization in the vicinity of important buildings, such as the city's palaces and Notre-Dame. Haussmann wished to make these monuments more visible and to create open spaces for public celebrations, while also making the city more defensible in times of riot. To contem-<lb/>
porary Parisians, it seemed that Haussmann's urban surgery had suddenly revealed hidden areas of their city as obscure, unvisited side streets were made busy and prosperous by their proximity to new boulevards. Although thousands of people were evicted and dem-<lb/>
olition sites sold to developers, the commercial and real-estate boom of the period drowned out the voices of protest against this wholesale destruction.</p>
<p>In addition to creating the great boulevards, Haussmann realigned many ordinary streets, regu-<lb/>
lated the appearance of building facades, planted miles of street trees, landscaped new public squares at important intersections, installed lights, benches, and other sidewalk amenities, and enlisted the sup-<lb/>
port of building owners in public-space cleaning pro-<lb/>
cedures that made the city a cynosure of municipal housekeeping.</p>
<p>To assign the emperor and Haussmann entire credit for the transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name> in the nine-<lb/>
teenth century is erroneous. The sovereign provided the conceptual support and the technocrat the finan-<lb/>
cial acumen and administrative zeal to achieve amaz-<lb/>
ingly speedy results, but neither projected an entirely original vision. Together they effected a canny mar-<lb/>
riage of French monumentalism and industrial capi-<lb/>
talism by energizing a planning process that had already begun.</p>
<p>Planning and historic preservation were born in <name type="place">Paris</name> in the wake of the French Revolution, when the state confiscated Church property and evaluated monuments of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> for conservation pur-<lb/>
poses. The Convention of <date when="1793">1793</date> commissioned a group of artists to prepare the so-called Artists' Plan in which individual districts were studied with a view toward the development of appropriated land and with the idea of displaying within a nexus of radiat-<lb/>
ing avenues buildings deemed of particular architec-<lb/>
tural importance (fig. 10.4). The Artists' Plan projected the creation and extension of long straight axes, notably in the densely clotted eastern part of the city, and it forecast one of the fundamental planning strategies of Haussmann's New <name type="place">Paris</name>: that based on an analysis of the city as stagecraft, with historic mon-<lb/>
uments and landmark buildings as well as important edifices of state symbolically embodying the new French polity displayed like set pieces. But this plan did not comprehend <name type="place">Paris</name>, as Haussmann's would, as an integer in which the city, not the sector, was the planning unit.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century,
<pb n="363"/>
<pb n="363" type="orig"/>
Napoleon I had pledged to make <name type="place">Paris</name> the most beau-<lb/>
tiful city in Europe. He was also aware of the need to modernize the city with projects that would improve public health, outdoor food markets, and traffic flow. Although his reign was too brief and the shortage of development capital too severe to initiate the kind of large-scale transformations that his nephew under-<lb/>
took a half century later, he effectively set the Neo-<lb/>
classical tone for most subsequent city planning. Renaming the place Louis XV the place de la Con-<lb/>
corde, he created an important cross axis running through it, emphasized by the construction of cer-<lb/>
tain iconic monuments. A mile distant along the tree-<lb/>
lined axis of the Champs-&#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es at the summit of Chaillot Hill, he constructed the largest triumphal arch ever built, the Arc de Triomphe (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x2013;36), a potent symbol and grandiose climax to one of the world's most important urban perspectives.</p>
<p>With the help of his favorite Neoclassical archi-<lb/>
tects, Charles Percier (<date when="1764">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838">1838</date>) and Pierre-Fran&#x00E7;ois-<lb/>
L&#x00E9;onard Fontaine (<date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">1853</date>), Napoleon established the beginning of an axis into the densely built quar-<lb/>
ters of eastern <name type="place">Paris</name> by transforming the northern edge of the Tuileries Gardens into the rue de Rivoli (fig. 10.5). Employing the traditional formula of the sidewalk arcade that we have observed in Henri IV's place Royale (place des Vosges), they built the first segment of massive buildings with horizontal bands of uniform balconies and stringcourses reinforcing the perspective line of the axis (see fig. 4.48). The con-<lb/>
tinuous balconies on the <hi rend="italic">piano nobile,</hi> third, and attic floors opened the spectacle of the street to those inside, suggesting its function as a parade route, while the extended ground-floor arcade made an elegant shoppers' promenade.</p>

<p>Louis-Philippe (ruled <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>) as a constitu-<lb/>
tional monarch lacked the resources for large-scale urban embellishment available to earlier kings, but he nevertheless continued the concept set forth in the Artists' Plan of emphasizing individual public spaces by erecting the July Column on the place de la Bastille and the Egyptian obelisk at the place de la Concorde (fig. 10.6; see fig. 6.38). In the <date when="1840">1840</date>s, he built the first railroad stations, including the Gare de l'Est, which was linked to the center of the city by the wide boule-<lb/>

<p>An especially important development that affected the future of city planning was the establish-<lb/>
ment in <date when="1819">1819</date> of the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts with its rig-<lb/>

As mentioned in Chapter Nine, it was here that the American architects responsible for the City Beautiful movement received their training beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.

<p>Napoleon III, having lived in <name type="place">London</name>, where architects and engineers were applying new forms of industrial technology to construction and urban prob-<lb/>
lem solving, desired to bring an even greater degree of modernity to the French capital. Even before appointing Haussmann prefect of the Department of the Seine, Napoleon III began extending the Rue de Rivoli east toward the Hôtel de Ville; refashioning Louis XIV's old hunting park, the Bois de Boulogne, into an English-style public pleasure ground; remov-<lb/>
ing the slum that had grown up between the Tuileries and the Louvre; restoring the cathedral of Notre-<lb/>
Dame; and planning a new food market, Les Halles Centrales. Napoleon III had, moreover, prepared a map of the city that showed an arterial network of <hi rend="italic">percements</hi> knifing through the older fabric of narrow short streets, and it was this graphic representation of his urban renewal proposals that he handed Hauss-<lb/>
mann upon his appointment. Even though this plan changed, particularly after <date when="1861">1861</date> when the annexation of the <hi rend="italic">outlying faubourgs</hi> created the need for new arterial connections, municipal buildings, and public services, Haussmann always viewed this imperial doc-<lb/>
ument as his charter, considering himself to be merely the emperor's servant and agent in transforming <name type="place">Paris</name>.</p>
<p>Haussmann had been prefect of Bordeaux before becoming prefect of the Department of the Seine in <date when="1853">1853</date>, a position that can be roughly charac-<lb/>
terized as city manager of <name type="place">Paris</name>. He was responsible for overseeing the planning, design, financing, and construction of all capital improvements as well as the daily operations of municipal management. To provide the necessary base maps for their work, Haussmann had thorough planimetric and topo-<lb/>
graphic surveys made of the city and its recently annexed suburbs. The resulting Plan of <name type="place">Paris</name> config-<lb/>
ured the city-in-transformation, plotting the <hi rend="italic">perce-<lb/>
ments,</hi> for which condemnation and demolition of property were necessary, as well as the new building alignments where existing streets were to be widened by the Service de la Voirie, or Bureau of Roads (fig. 10.7). Thoroughly technocratic in his approach to his job, he had as his chief associates engineers such as Eug&#x00E8;ne Belgrand (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">1878</date>), who conceived and managed the construction of the vast new aqueduct and sewer systems, and the landscape designer <name type="pname">Jean-<lb/>
Charles-Adolphe Alphand</name> (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>), whom he put in charge of constructing new parks, promenades, and city squares.</p>
<p>Squares such as the place du Cht&#x00E2;elet sacrificed their status as <hi rend="italic">places,</hi> becoming instead vehicular traf-<lb/>
fic circles and pedestrian traffic islands, a function that distinguished the Parisian squares from the ones in <name type="place">London</name>, which continued to serve as quiet urban oases even after that city's modernization. They were given attractive but standardized street furniture, which in its ubiquity served informally to symbolize the city's distinctive new appearance (fig. 10.8). In developing these nodes of relation, as Haussmann termed them, for the boulevard systems, Le Nôtre's paradigm of avenues radiating from <hi rend="italic">rond-points</hi> served him well, allowing the city both fluidity of motion and monumental axiality.</p>
<p>The Champs-&#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es was redefined with new <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> of trees and lined with gaslights designed by Jakob Ignaz (Jacques-Ignace) Hittorff (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">1867</date>),
<pb n="365"/>
<pb n="365" type="orig"/>
the city architect. In the eastern sector of the city, the southern part of the Canal Saint-Martin was decked over to become the boulevard Richard-Lenoir in <date when="1861">1861</date>. The same kinds of trees, flowers, news kiosks, con-<lb/>
cession stands, and gaslights that made western <name type="place">Paris</name> attractive to the rich also appeared in this less affluent part of the city.</p>
<p>Just beyond the outer ring of boulevards, which had replaced the customs wall of <date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;88, lay two large royal hunting parks: the Bois de Boulogne in the west was approached by Haussmann's new, wide avenue de l'Tmp&#x00E9;ratrice (avenue Foch), and the Bois de Vincennes was situated in the east to the south of the porte de Vincennes and the existing ceremonial thoroughfare, the cours de Vincennes. To serve the recreational needs of high society in <hi rend="italic">le West End,</hi> Alp-<lb/>
hand was charged with continuing the conversion of the Bois de Boulogne into an elegant pleasure ground with passages of Picturesque scenery interspersed with a race track and restaurants (figs. 10.9a, 10.9b).</p>
<p>Because it is a collection of unrelated facilities as well as a palimpsest inscribed with traces of past uses, the Bois de Boulogne park complex does not have the unified planning vision characteristic of Olmsted's parks in <name type="place">America</name>, with which it is con-<lb/>
temporary. While developed in the English style with undulating paths replacing all but two of the former straight <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> and an irregular-shaped lake reminis-<lb/>
cent of the Serpentine in <name type="place">London</name>'s Hyde Park, it is more a collection of heterogeneous amusements. Lovely as it is in some of its parts, particularly the Bagatelle and the Shakespeare Garden, these were not developed as part of a comprehensive landscape design. Nor is there, as in Central Park, an overriding note of moral purpose; the Bois de Boulogne was intended more as a fashionable resort than as a pas-<lb/>
toral antidote to urban stress.</p>
<p>Although intended for the working class, the Bois de Vincennes was treated to a similar degree of Picturesque detail as the Bois de Boulogne. In addi-<lb/>
tion to these two large parks, Haussmann created the Parc Montsouris along the city's southern edge between the Porte d'Orl&#x00E9;ans and the Porte d'Italie and refashioned the Parc Monceau, the duc de Chartres's eighteenth-century <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi> at the northwest-<lb/>
ern edge of the city, into a Picturesque nineteenth-century park containing several of Louis de Carmontelle's remaining <hi rend="italic">follies.</hi> In the northeastern quadrant of the city, between <date when="1864">1864</date> and <date when="1867">1867</date>, he transformed the vermin-infested Buttes-Chaumont, an abandoned rock quarry where squatters lived, into a romantically Picturesque 55-acre park (fig. 10.10).</p>

<p>The spirit that informs all of these Parisian parks is highly theatrical. Resembling elaborate stage sets, many passages of their scenery are composed of rock-<lb/>
<pb n="366"/>

work combining natural and simulated stones. At the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, Alphand's Picturesque genius was given full rein, and at <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the cost of redesigning the much larger Bois de Boulogne, he added huge quantities of artificial rockwork to the existing old quarry faces, thereby creating a romantic pseudomountainous landscape rising out of an artificial lake.<ref target="#CH10-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref>Two streams, one containing a waterfall that spilled into a grotto with artificial sta-<lb/>

<p>Haussmann's parks are not, like those of Olm-<lb/>
sted and Vaux, a reaction to the industrial city, a rural vision of pastoral peace offered to counteract urban stress; rather they present themselves as additional pleasures in a city of many pleasures, a city already comfortable in its progressive modernity. Although these French parks partake of the same Picturesque style as the American parks, they are not naturalistic in the way Olmsted's parks are. The French parks incorporate plantings of lush, high-maintenance, sub-<lb/>
tropical vegetation, and their path systems do not con-<lb/>
form to the dictates of topography, but assume the lines of the French curve, a drafting instrument with scroll-shaped cutouts. Regarding the latter, the gar-<lb/>
den writer and editor William Robinson penned these caustic words: "In the plans of the best French land-<lb/>
scape-gardeners it is quite ridiculous to see the way the walks wind about in symmetrical twirlings, and, when they have entwined themselves through every sweep of turf in the place, seem to long for more spaces to writhe about in."<ref target="#CH10-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>The sinuosity that was an end in itself as well as the concentration on effects that the French term <hi rend="italic">f&#x00E9;erique,</hi> enchanting and fairy-<lb/>
like, bespeak an underlying cultural attitude that has more in common with Disney's Magic Kingdom than with the pastoral simplicity of Central Park where all adornment&#x2014;botanical, sculptural, or architectural&#x2014; was clearly subservient to a landscape composition designed to carry the visitor through a chain of scenes in which the experience is primarily <hi rend="italic">spatial.</hi></p>
<p>Several illustrations in Alphand's book, <hi rend="italic">Les Promenades de <name type="place">Paris</name></hi> (<date when="1867">1867</date>&#x2013;73), an important record of Haussmann's transformation of the city, depict the characteristic treatment of the new streets and their related green spaces (fig. 10.12). Maintenance codes governed the appearance of private frontages, ensuring the cleanliness of facades and their scrap-<lb/>
ing and painting or whitewashing at intervals of ten years or less.</p>
<p>In making <name type="place">Paris</name> both progressive and pleasura-<lb/>
ble, Haussmann also changed its scale. The city grew in size by one half with the addition of the new <hi rend="italic">arrondissements.</hi> The unprecedented length of Hauss-<lb/>
mann's wide, straight boulevards&#x2014;their perspectival views emphasized by even building walls with uni-<lb/>
form roof, cornice, and balcony lines&#x2014;made the extent of the urban mass more readily apparent. In addition, wider streets made taller buildings possible and even desirable as a matter of proportionate rela-<lb/>
tionship, a fact recognized in the <date when="1859">1859</date> building code, which decreed that on streets 65 feet (20 meters) or more wide, buildings could gain 8 feet (2.5 meters)&#x2014; amounting to an additional story&#x2014;in height.</p>
<p>Haussmann's boulevard openings were the
<pb n="367"/>
<pb n="367" type="orig"/>
occasions for triumphal public celebration presided over by the emperor. With their Venetian banners and gold curtains decorated with stars and garlands, these unveilings memorialized not only the grandeur of the remade city, but also the power of government, municipal and state. Perhaps the emperor risked too much politically in allowing Haussmann to lavish resources to such an extent upon the capital and, at least during the first decade of his administration, to publicize them so conspicuously. Eventually, opposi-<lb/>
tion within the Chamber of Deputies caused an inves-<lb/>
tigation into the prefect's methods of financing, and the discovery of certain irregularities brought about his dismissal in <date when="1870">1870</date>.</p>
<p>That same year Napoleon III capitulated to the Germans at Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. A republic was proclaimed, bringing about the fall of the Second Empire and the end of Napoleon's reign. The war continued as <name type="place">Paris</name> underwent a four months' seige and then German occupation before surren-<lb/>
dering. Within weeks, revolutionary forces were elected to the <name type="place">Paris</name> municipal council, and these rad-<lb/>
ical members of the Commune seized control of the city. Their revolt against the national government, however, was quickly crushed by the troops of the new republic.</p>
<p>These events did not put an end to <name type="place">Paris</name>'s con-<lb/>
tinued modernization in the Haussmannian manner. The Communards' damage to the city was severe, but after their brief time in power, the Third Repub-<lb/>
lic set about repairing the destruction, extending more avenues, and refurbishing the Luxembourg Gardens. Gabriel-Jean-Antoine Davioud, a park designer in the Haussmann administration, designed the grandiose Trocad&#x00E9;ro Palace in a pseudo-Spanish Moorish style as <name type="place">Paris</name> prepared to host the International Exhibition of <date when="1878">1878</date>, an opportunity to reassert its industrial modernity and cultural advancement.</p>
<p><name type="place">Paris</name> had already hosted two international fairs to showcase industrial technology in <date when="1855">1855</date> and <date when="1867">1867</date>. Beginning in <date when="1867">1867</date>, the Champs-de-Mars, which had been laid out as a parade ground in <date when="1765">1765</date> between the &#x00C9;cole Militaire and the Seine, became the site of these expositions. The huge vaulted spaces of the <name type="place">Paris</name> exhi-<lb/>
bition halls experimentally employed the new build-<lb/>
ing materials of iron and glass, the engineering potential of which was first demonstrated by Loudon's greenhouse constructions and then by Pax-<lb/>
ton's Crystal Palace in <name type="place">London</name>. Just as the city was being opened up and made porous, so these new Industrial Age structures, which seemed startlingly light and lacking in <hi rend="italic">gravitas</hi> at the time, posited an architectural idiom that no longer walled in volu-<lb/>
metric space but dematerialized mass, transforming buildings into airy cages in which the interpenetra-<lb/>
tion of indoors and outdoors became the dominant theme. The structure containing the exhibition halls for the <date when="1867">1867</date> fair was an enormous ellipse of seven concentric galleries featuring a garden with statues and palm trees in the center oval.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Gustave Eiffel</name> (<date when="1832">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1923">1923</date>) was at the time of the <date when="1867">1867</date> exposition a young engineer who had founded a factory capable of producing the iron skeleton of the vast gallery on the outer edge of the ellipse, the Galerie des Machines, which had a height of 82 feet (25 meters) and a span of 115 feet (35 meters). Eiffel was also responsible for the hydraulic lifts that introduced the public to a new means of vertical movement.</p>
<p>The Centennial Exposition of <date when="1889">1889</date>, which fol-<lb/>
lowed the International Exhibition that had been staged in <date when="1878">1878</date> to prove that <name type="place">Paris</name> had recovered from the effects of the Communard rebellion and the Franco-Prussian War, pushed French technological experimentation and search for new building forms to new heights, both figuratively and literally. The structure that most impressed visitors to the <date when="1889">1889</date> fair was Eiffel's 984-foot (300-meter) tower of open-lat-<lb/>
tice wrought iron. Eiffel, who had also distinguished himself as a bridge builder, designed it as a demon-<lb/>
stration in structural aerodynamics and load-bearing engineering. Twice as high as the dome of St. Peter's or the Great Pyramid of Khufu at Giza and, unlike these monuments, a labor of mere months, not decades, this icon of early modernity has remained, above all other features within that heavily orna-<lb/>
mented city, the instantly recognizable symbol of <name type="place">Paris</name>.<ref target="#CH10-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref>It was the tallest structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in <name type="place">New York</name> was built in <date when="1930">1930</date>.</p>
<p>Elevators manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company ascend on a curve, carrying visitors to the successive platforms. Suddenly, it was possible to have a panoramic vision not merely of landscape, such as Alpinists could experience by ascending high peaks, but of urban form and history The Eiffel Tower made available to millions of visitors the city's structure as concrete abstraction, giving each the ability to deci-<lb/>
pher in a single reading all known landmarks, topo-<lb/>
graphical and structural, and to discern in this act the story of the city's earliest formation and growth through the centuries. Thus equipped with panoramic vision, one could also profoundly imagine the human dimension of the metropolis, the multitude of indi-<lb/>
vidual lives of the teeming population below. Yet, in the vertiginous descent, structure seems to fragment, and the scenery of the city below appears to spin in kaleidoscopic fashion. The ebullient Cubism of Robert Delaunay (<date when="1885">1885</date>&#x2013;<date when="1941">1941</date>), who painted many ver-<lb/>
sions of the Eiffel Tower beginning in <date when="1910">1910</date>, captures the exhilaration of this quintessentially modern expe-<lb/>
rience of space and landscape (fig. 10.13).</p>

<p>It would be difficult to exaggerate the effect of Hauss-<lb/>
mann's <name type="place">Paris</name> on other cities of the world. It is fair to say that, even within the context of modernism and postmodernism, designers have continued to employ some of the devices of monumental urban planning, of which mid-nineteenth-century <name type="place">Paris</name> remains the primary example, especially in capital cities where the building program has called for a symbolical display of government power through architecture and land-<lb/>
scape. Even without such an agenda, modernism's imperative to enable vehicular movement and to assist the forces of capitalist industry and commerce was strong, and practically everywhere old streets were widened, fortifications gave way to new boulevards, and rail transportation systems were built as city after city was opened up both to new possibilities of urban life and to a radically new urban form.</p>

</figure>
<p>Ironically, in democratic <name type="place">America</name> the desire for civic monumentality was such that Gilded Age mag-<lb/>
nates and political leaders overlooked the authoritar-<lb/>
ianism implicit in this style of city planning, adopting its forms to express the lofty ideals of the republic rather than the power of monarchy. It was a time when newly made American millionaires looked to Europe for role models in the mores of aristocracy. It was a time when Americans sought to emulate Europe's impressive legacy of heritage buildings and monuments in the mansions of the rich and in the public art and architecture that proclaimed the pros-<lb/>
perity and dignity of their cities. In this they were helped by the training undertaken by design profes-<lb/>
sionals. The aesthetics of several generations of American architects and landscape architects was forged in Haussman's <name type="place">Paris</name> under the influence of the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts where they studied beginning in the last third of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, in the wake of the <date when="1893">1893</date> <name type="place">Chicago</name> World's Fair, the neo-<lb/>
classicism they imbibed there was being vigorously promoted by Charles Mulford Robinson, a Rochester, <name type="place">New York</name>, journalist and the author of <hi rend="italic">The Improve-<lb/>
ment of Towns and Cities, or the Practical Basis of Civic Aesthetics</hi> (<date when="1901">1901</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Modern Civic Art, or The City Made Beautiful</hi> (<date when="1903">1903</date>). The City Beautiful movement aimed at ennobling American cities and European colonial capitals through monumental planning, and Daniel Burnham, fresh from his triumph as principal plan-<lb/>
ner of the <date when="1893">1893</date> World's Columbian Fair in <name type="place">Chicago</name>, was commissioned to develop new layouts for <name type="place">Cleveland</name>, <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, <name type="place">Manila</name>, and <name type="place">Chicago</name> (fig. 10.14). Where there were existing gridiron street patterns, these plans attempted to impose upon them grand diagonal boulevards whose intersections formed mag-<lb/>
nificent plazas and whose vistas terminated in mon-<lb/>
umental public works.</p>
<p>Frederick Law Olmsted had spent a good deal of time during his last productive years mentoring his son and namesake who became his professional heir and the future head of the firm. It is ironic in light of Olmsted, Sr.'s, antipathy toward the heroic style of the Gilded Age that one of the first commissions <name type="pname">Olmsted</name>, Jr., assumed upon entering practice was in collaboration with Burnham. Following the <name type="place">Chicago</name> World's Fair, Senator James McMillan's Committee on the District of Columbia appointed him landscape architect on the team under Burnham's leadership to carry L'Enfant's original plan for the nation's capital to a new level of monumental grandeur. The other members were Stanford White's partner, <name type="pname">Charles McKim</name> (<date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1909">1909</date>), and the Beaux-Arts sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens (<date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1907">1907</date>).</p>
<p>In order to prepare themselves for this chal-<lb/>
<pb n="369"/>
<pb n="369" type="orig"/>
lenging assignment to give <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, an image that not only glorified the founders of the republic and the president who saved the Union but also one that suited America's newly assumed iden-<lb/>
tity as a world power, Burnham, McKim, Olmsted, and the secretary to Senator McMillan, Charles Moore, sailed for Europe in the summer of <date when="1901">1901</date> to study architecture, parks, and urban design in several cities. For seven weeks they sketched and discussed ideas stimulated by their travels to <name type="place">Paris</name>, <name type="place">Rome</name>, <name type="place">Venice</name>, <name type="place">Budapest</name>, <name type="place">Frankfurt</name>, <name type="place">Berlin</name>, and <name type="place">London</name>.</p>
<p>Washington's layout had become muddled by later nonconforming elements, such as a train station athwart the Mall, but the outlines of its grand plan, derived from that of Versailles, were partially realized and called for further development. Not surprisingly, the members of the team returned on the first of August determined to clarify, reinforce, and extend L'Enfant's axial plan (fig. 10.15). Within the con-<lb/>
tentious atmosphere of <name type="place">Washington</name> politics, they were fortunate to win critical support from President Theodore Roosevelt and, after his election in <date when="1909">1909</date>, from President William Howard Taft. Thus, con-<lb/>
gressional opponents did not manage to derail the McMillan team's intentions, and the head of the Penn-<lb/>
sylvania Railroad acceded to its recommendation that Union Station be placed north of the Capitol. Con-<lb/>
struction of a new station according to Burnham's plans was completed in <date when="1907">1907</date>, and the old train tracks were removed from the Mall once it was made oper-<lb/>
ational. Adjacent to the station on the northwest a similarly monumental new Post Office, also designed by Burnham, was built. The proposal to realign the Mall on axis with the <name type="place">Washington</name> Monument and plant the remainder as a simple grass <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> bordered by quadruple rows of elms was also carried out after much debate and furor in the press.</p>
<p>As his final act of office before leaving the pres-<lb/>
idency, Theodore Roosevelt appointed a Council of Fine Arts composed of architects, painters, sculptors, and a landscape architect&#x2014;Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. Approved in a bill passed by the House of Repre-<lb/>
sentatives and Senate in <date when="1910">1910</date>, the seven-member com-<lb/>
mission appointed by Taft continued to include Olmsted. The Mall axis was extended according to the McMillan Plan beyond L'Enfant's original plan, and a canal-like reflecting basin was built between the <name type="place">Washington</name> Monument and Henry Bacon's new Gre-<lb/>
cian-style temple housing the monumental statue of President Abraham Lincoln by Daniel Chester French in Potomac Park. This impressive memorial to the nation's sixteenth president, the subject of contro-<lb/>

</figure>
<p>As with other elements of the plan, politics and professional rivalries plagued the development of Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, a 2-and-½-mile (4-kilo-<lb/>
meter) scenic road connecting the Potomac waterfront near the Lincoln Memorial with Rock Creek Park north of the National Zoo at the northern boundary of the District of Columbia.<ref target="#CH10-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref>It is sometimes forgot-<lb/>
ten that the City Beautiful movement, while advocat-<lb/>
ing neoclassical monuments, axial planning, and geometrical landscape design, also propounded the need for park systems in which naturalistic landscap-<lb/>
ing complemented Beaux-Arts architectural grandeur. While Senator James McMillan chaired the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, the official name of the <date when="1901">1901</date> McMillan Commission charged with detailing the plan for monumental <name type="place">Washington</name> was the Senate Park Commission, and its <date when="1902">1902</date> report is titled <hi rend="italic">The Improvement of the Park System of the District of Columbia.</hi> Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., the author of the park and parkway sections of the report, sought to furnish the nation's capital with the same type of parks and park-connecting parkways that had recently been created in <name type="place">New York</name>, <name type="place">Boston</name>, and Buffalo and were being developed for Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Min-<lb/>
neapolis, and other American cities.</p>
<p>Seen as a means of curing an environmental problem and an eyesore (industrial wastes were dumped along the lower portions of Rock Creek), as well as a way to eliminate the topographical barrier between Georgetown and <name type="place">Washington</name> proper, the project was delayed by debate, continuing for several years, over whether it should be an open-valley scenic parkway or a boulevard-type "closed" parkway cov-<lb/>
ering a conduit (figs. 10.16a, 10.16b). Finally, on <date when="1913-03-14">March 14, 1913</date>, Congress passed a bill authorizing the open-<lb/>
valley concept. Olmsted continued to maintain his involvement as a consultant to the project and was dis-<lb/>
appointed when aspects of his advice, such as the perimeter roadways and some of the Picturesque effects seen in the <date when="1916">1916</date> plan, were ignored (fig. 10.17). Other aesthetically desirable elements were eliminated in the interests of economy and traffic engineering, but finally, in <date when="1923">1923</date>, ten years after its authorization, the parkway was under construction. With the impetus gained from federal work programs in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s, it was almost completed by the end of that decade.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of many of the objectives of the McMillan report remained the most realized achieve-<lb/>
ment of the City Beautiful movement in America. Nowhere except in <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, were the results of this effort accomplished on an urban scale, but several civic centers and many banks, libraries, museums, train stations, bridges, and monuments were added to the American cityscape as a result of this impulse (see fig. 9.59). Typically, municipal gov-<lb/>
ernment followed, rather than led, the efforts that were organized by groups of public-spirited citizens and journalists as city after city in the United States followed the lead of Burnham and Robinson, seek-<lb/>
ing to counteract the ugliness of their earlier rapid commercial and industrial growth with Neoclassical urban monumentalism.</p>
<p>As we shall see in the next chapter, the rich vocabulary of forms inherited from <name type="place">France</name> and <name type="place">Italy</name> furnished British and American garden designers with many motifs, which they borrowed freely. The stu-<lb/>
<pb n="371"/>
<pb n="371" type="orig"/>
dents at the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts and the <name type="place">Rome</name> Prize winners at the American Academy did not ponder deeply the humanist iconography informing these now agreeably mellow garden landscapes, but sought instead to appropriate their aura of venerability along with their undeniably fine compositional elements. They looked to these antique landscapes for inspira-<lb/>
tion because, like the characters in the novels of Henry James, they were subject to a peculiarly Amer-<lb/>
ican sense of cultural inferiority. Regular transatlantic travel by steamship, another Industrial Age trans-<lb/>
portation advancement, made them acutely aware of their own country's narrow history and thin civiliza-<lb/>
tion when compared with the many centuries of human artistic endeavor recorded in the stones of Europe's ancient ruins, medieval cathedrals, and Renaissance villas and ch&#x00E2;teaux. Others of their coun-<lb/>
trymen saw American civilization in somewhat dif-<lb/>
ferent terms, as an opportunity to forge a new kind of national identity, one that celebrated the country's uniqueness in occupying almost an entire continent that was by nature endowed with scenery in all three traditional categories&#x2014;beautiful, picturesque, and sublime. Surely, they reasoned with transcendental-<lb/>
ist conviction, that very scenery, particularly in its sub-<lb/>
lime dimension, was a natural resource even more fundamental to the ethos of their freshly evolving civ-<lb/>
ilization than any replication of European monu-<lb/>
mental grandeur on native soil could ever be. By conserving significant lands within the public domain through the creation of a national park system, they would vouchsafe for future generations this wonder-<lb/>
ful patrimony, which also constituted a newly avail-<lb/>
able stimulus to tourism and recreation.</p>

<p>In <date when="1851">1851</date>, a U.S. Army party known as the Mari-<lb/>
posa Battalion pursued a band of Miwok-Paiute Indians into the Yosemite Valley of <name type="place">California</name>. Although prospectors had come upon it earlier, it was the Mariposa Battalion's report of Yosemite's stunning scenery that aroused the interest of entrepreneurs eager to exploit natural wonders as tourist attractions. We may recall that journalists had played an important role in the creation of Central Park. Similarly, writers and publishers took up the Yosemite cause. In this they were aided by the emerging art of photography. Stere-<lb/>
ographs for the armchair traveler spread the fame of the sheer granite walls rising 3,000 feet (914 meters) from the valley floor, but the real power and majesty of the scenery was better conveyed by the prints made from large glass plate negatives by Carleton E. Watkins (<date when="1829">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1916">1916</date>) and other photographers.</p>
<p>Wordsworthian Romanticism and the desire to celebrate an American equivalent to the Alps&#x2014;which John Ruskin had brought into focus as scenery of the sublime category capable of inspiring emotion in cul-<lb/>
tivated breasts&#x2014;as well as the delight American chau-<lb/>
vinists found in appropriating a "sacred place" that was equivalent to a Gothic cathedral or a Greek tem-<lb/>
ple soon led to the proposal to set aside the Yosemite and the nearby Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees <hi rend="italic">(Sequoia gigantea</hi>) as an inalienable part of the public domain. A bill was introduced in the United States Senate in <date when="1864">1864</date> to cede these lands to the state of <name type="place">Cal-<lb/>
ifornia</name> "for public use, resort and recreation," and when it was passed and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln, the first step had been taken toward preserving portions of the national scenic pat-<lb/>
rimony for popular enjoyment. At this time, envi-<lb/>
ronmentalism and preserving wilderness to protect select ecosystems was not part of the public con-<lb/>
sciousness; the new park was regarded rather as a tourist commodity to be appreciated for its sublime scenery in the same manner as one would admire a noble work of art.</p>
<p>As discussed in Chapter Nine, at the time of Yosemite's acquisition by the state of <name type="place">California</name> (it would later become part of the national park system), Frederick Law Olm-<lb/>
sted, Sr., was in <name type="place">California</name> as the director of the Mariposa Mines, and because of his reputation as a park administrator, was appointed by the governor to oversee the development of design and management policies for Yosemite Park and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. In a letter to his wife, Olmsted shared his first impression of this fine stand of <name type="place">California</name> giant sequoia trees: "You recognize them as soon as your eye falls on them, far away, not merely from the unusual size of the trunk but its remarkable color&#x2014;a cinnamon color, very elegant. You feel that they are distinguished strangers [who] have come down to us from another world, &#x2014;but the whole for-<lb/>
est is wonderful."<ref target="#CH10-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Olmsted, like almost everyone else at the time, realized the opportunity Yosemite presented for the burgeoning tourist industry and remarked in the report that he wrote in <date when="1865">1865</date> that Yosemite should "prove an attraction of simi-<lb/>
lar character and a similar source of wealth to the whole community, not only of <name type="place">California</name> but of the United States"<ref target="#CH10-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref>as the natural scenery of Switzerland. The nineteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury appetite for scenic wonders was tremendous, as the popularity of Niagara Falls had proved. Here, on an even grander scale than Niagara, was an example
<pb n="372"/>
<pb n="372" type="orig"/>
of scenery that could be characterized as sublime. Already painters and lithographers as well as pho-<lb/>
tographers and writers were making a living depict-<lb/>
ing it, and hotel developers and souvenir vendors were busy with schemes to exploit it.</p>
<p>The first object of any plan for Yosemite would necessarily be to protect its scenic integrity and to pre-<lb/>
vent the kind of commercial exploitation that marred the landscape around Niagara in the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. Fortunately nature had accomplished at Yosemite what extensive grading and planting had done in Central Park: the visual exclusion of the rest of the world from an idyllic landscape. Lofty walls enclosed the valley and helped the visitor experience the exhilarating sense of spatial completeness and sanctity as in a majestic cathedral. For Olmsted, Yosemite represented "the union of the deepest sub-<lb/>
limity with the deepest beauty of nature, not in one feature or another, not in one part or one scene or another, not any landscape that can be framed by itself, but all around and wherever the visitor goes."<ref target="#CH10-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> It had taken him some months to appreciate the beauty of <name type="place">California</name>'s dry-climate vegetation, but now in his Yosemite report, he could rhapsodize: "Cliffs of awful height and rocks of vast magnitude . . . are banked and fringed and draped and shadowed by the tender foliage of noble and lovely trees and bushes, reflected from the most placid pools, and associated with the most tranquil meadows, the most playful streams, and every variety of soft and peaceful pas-<lb/>
toral beauty."<ref target="#CH10-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref>The plan that he proposed was one with as few "artificial constructions" as possible and a circular carriage drive with turnouts placed to pres-<lb/>
ent the best opportunities for scenic viewing.</p>

</figure>
<p>Today we think of Yosemite as simply one park within a magnificent system of national parks, and we therefore perhaps underestimate the powerful place it occupied in the nineteenth-century imagina-<lb/>
tion. The geologist Clarence King must have felt, like Olmsted, that Yosemite presented a synthesis of the sublime and the beautiful when he spoke of "a soft aerial depth of purple tone ... hiding details, veiling with its soft amethystine obscurity all that hard, bro-<lb/>
ken roughness of the Sentinel cliffs."<ref target="#CH10-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>The inclina-<lb/>
tion toward the reverential was greatly enhanced by the atmospheric qualities of Albert Bierstadt's large and immensely popular paintings that cast religious light and color over the scene rather than emphasiz-<lb/>
ing Yosemite's sculptural qualities as Carleton Watkins's photographs did (fig. 10.18).</p>
<p>Perhaps the Sierra <name type="place">Nevada</name> and Yosemite found their true prophet in the naturalist John Muir (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1914">1914</date>). What Ruskin had been to the Alps, Muir was to the Sierra. Ruskin saw the mountains as the "schools and cathedrals" of the human race, "full of treasures of illuminated manuscript for the scholar, kindly in simple lessons to the worker, quiet in pale cloisters for the thinker, glorious in holiness for the worshipper."<ref target="#CH10-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>Muir found holy inspiration in trying to fathom the geologic history of the mountains that had been shaped by almost unimaginably powerful forces, including the passage of mighty glaciers.</p>
<p>The poet Wordsworth, whose lasting influence pervaded, however unconsciously, the attitude of wilderness lovers such as Muir, had conceived of "spots in time," vivid scenes of nature that became imprinted on the mind. Like funds in the bank avail-<lb/>
able for withdrawal at a later date, these scenes pro-<lb/>
vided capital for recollection and contemplation in the future. Muir's impressions perhaps went further; he believed that the sights of nature reveal the majesty of God and leave a permanent mark upon our souls. To Ralph Waldo Emerson, he extended an invitation to experience the exaltation of a journey with him in the high Sierras. The transcendentalist and author of the famous essay "On Nature" answered the call and, in <date when="1871">1871</date>, at the age of sixty-seven, made the arduous and rewarding journey.</p>
<p>Unknown except to Native Americans, trappers, and a few intrepid frontiersmen whose accounts of its seemingly fantastic, cosmically disordered scenery of spluttering mud volcanoes, shooting geysers, and boiling sulfur springs was often discounted, Yellow-<lb/>
stone did not enter the public consciousness until around <date when="1870">1870</date>. Again, it was journalists, artists, and pho-<lb/>
tographers who stimulated appreciation of this col-<lb/>
lection of natural wonders. Ferdinand V. Hayden, director of the U.S. Geological Survey, sought funds for a scientific exploration of the area, and his expe-<lb/>
dition party included the photographer William H. Jackson (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1942">1942</date>) and the painter Thomas Moran
<pb n="373"/>
<pb n="373" type="orig"/>
(<date when="1837">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1926">1926</date>). Not only were the national parks to be objects of national pride and cultural icons them-<lb/>
selves, but also the depiction of them set new stan-<lb/>
dards of taste in landscape art and scenic appreciation. The work of Moran and Jackson was instrumental in the campaign that resulted in the passage in <date when="1872">1872</date> of a bill in Congress to establish Yellowstone as the coun-<lb/>
try's first national park (fig. 10.19).</p>
<p>Proponents, many of whom were railroad magnates and businessmen, deemed the benefits of the proposed park to be considerable: It would stim-<lb/>
ulate tourism and passenger railroads. For many tourists, of course, it was not the sublimity of the Yel-<lb/>
lowstone Canyon that attracted them as much as the weird, infernal performances of the mud pots, hot springs, and geysers. They came primarily to be enter-<lb/>
tained by these phenomenal features. John Muir, how-<lb/>
ever, could be depended on to read into the phantasmagorical Yellowstone landscape lessons both divine and Darwinian as he reminded his readers of the creative power of geologic forces embodying "cre-<lb/>
ation, progress in the march of beauty through death."<ref target="#CH10-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref>To his spiritual passion Muir wedded a prac-<lb/>
tical sense, and through his efforts the Sierra Club was founded as an organization advocating public own-<lb/>
ership of wilderness lands and, later, environmental protection in more general ways.</p>
<p>In <date when="1890">1890</date>, the Yosemite area (minus the Yosemite Valley) was transferred from the state of <name type="place">California</name> to the national government, and, in <date when="1899">1899</date>, Mount Rainier National Park was created. Other parks were acquired not only for scenic, but also for scientific and histori-<lb/>
cal reasons, especially after Theodore Roosevelt, encouraged through his association with <name type="pname">John Muir</name>, became an early proponent of conservation. The administration of these parks was haphazard, for there was as yet no National Park Service. Then, in <date when="1914">1914</date>, Stephen Mather (<date when="1867">1867</date>&#x2013;<date when="1930">1930</date>), an industrialist in <name type="place">Chicago</name> and an ardent hiker and member of the Sierra Club, wrote to Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, complaining of the condition of the parks. Lane, well aware of the problem, had already employed a young lawyer in <name type="place">California</name>, <name type="pname">Horace M. Albright</name>, to study ways to improve the administra-<lb/>
tion of the national parks. Recognizing that, as a businessman, Mather possessed considerable organi-<lb/>
zational and administrative talents, Lane promptly invited him to come to <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, and take charge of the situation. Mather accepted the chal-<lb/>
lenge, and he and Albright became a formidable team. Their combination of idealism and pragmatism forged the National Parks Act, creating the National Park Service, which President Woodrow Wilson signed into law in <date when="1916">1916</date>. The national park system that was forged in the ensuing years&#x2014;as many more national parks were created, historic sites designated, and large tracts of unspoiled coastline legislated into national seashores&#x2014;is a proud achievement of the American people and has been a potent instrument in shaping the nation's image of itself.</p>

hnology and the speeded-up tempo of twen-<lb/>
tieth-century machine-age civilization. It is expressed in several arts: in painting and sculpture as Cubism, Futurism, and other styles that fragment form and generally value its abstract character more than any remaining narrative content; in music as jazz, a fluid, improvisational medium that captures the syncopated tempo and erotic energy pulsing through urban life; in archi-<lb/>
tecture as design that honors industrial technology and materials by divesting itself of the proportions and ornament of classi-<lb/>
cal humanism and the structural means and decorative vocabulary inherited from the medieval and Renaissance past; in lit-<lb/>
erature as poems and novels that portray the transactions between the human soul and societies in which the security of com-<lb/>
munity has been superseded by personal anonymity and an intoxicating sense of possibility derived from new means of physical mobility and a new sense of social freedom. Modernism is fundamentally a state of culture that romanticizes reason, believing that rational application of sci-<lb/>

Being reactive, it is stylistically reiterative, re-presenting historical styles in quotation form, as echoes of earlier forms within a contemporary culture that is philosophically groundless and therefore without a special formal vocabulary of its own.

<p>The unease and anomie that people experience when familiar social structures have collapsed created a conservative reaction to machine-age modernity: Historicism, a mentality that values par-<lb/>
ticular cultures and vanished epochs. Giambattista Vico (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x2014; <date when="1744">1744</date>) was a progenitor of the idea that there is no universal, timeless human culture, that remote cultures are entirely different from current ones, and that it is the task of the historian to recon-<lb/>
struct a view of other times and other places with deep, sympa-<lb/>
thetic imagination. <name type="pname">Johann Gottfried von Herder</name> (<date when="1744">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>) propounded this thesis, which became one of the several strands of Romantic thought. His views helped establish a deeper and more discriminating appreciation of the particular artistic expres-<lb/>
sions of various cultures, both ones that were remote in time and place and others nearer at hand. The search for roots, for history, so prevalent today even as the entire world streams toward glo-<lb/>
balization, the latest and most advanced form of cosmopolitan-<lb/>
ism, is symptomatic of the continuing hold Herder's Romantic thesis has upon our minds.</p>
<p><name type="pname">John Ruskin</name> (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) was the principal contemporary spokesman for the viewpoint that denied the beneficence of Vic-<lb/>
torian industrial progress as it was reaching its apogee in late nineteenth-century <name type="place">England</name>. As the precursor of the Arts and Crafts movement, Ruskin articulated its fundamental principles in <hi rend="italic">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>). These included architecture for the sake of beauty rather than mere function, honesty of materials, power of impression, inspiration from nature, virile liveliness, commemorative quality, and accordance with universally accepted styles. Ruskin found in medieval styles and their several period and regional inflections an architecture that accorded with these concepts. His influence was strong and long-lasting, helping to account for the naturalistic exuberance of nineteenth-century architectural ornament and the extensive use of animal and vegetable forms in the decorative arts.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement expressed a simi-<lb/>
lar reaction to machine technology. Perhaps the most articulate and angry among them was the English poet, designer, and social-<lb/>
ist lecturer William Morris (<date when="1834">1834</date>&#x2014;<date when="1896">1896</date>), who wrote extensively on the problems associated with industrialization, gave practical application to Ruskin's philosophy, and was closely allied with the group of painters who called themselves the Pre-Raphaelites. Like Ruskin, Morris was a strong proponent of medievalism because of the artisan traditions represented by the craft guilds in the Middle Ages. In <date when="1861">1861</date>, he opened a firm, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Company&#x2014;"Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals"&#x2014;for the production of handcrafted home furnishings. For Morris, an imaginary sojourn in the Middle Ages provided a mental escape from the fast-changing landscape of the nineteenth century. His own highly organic but stylized designs for wallpaper and furniture ornament are akin to medieval patterns. In <date when="1877">1877</date>&#x2014;several years before he published <hi rend="italic">News from Nowhere</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), his utopian guide to the future&#x2014;Morris founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which focused on the simple beauty of vernacular architecture. Historic preser-<lb/>
vation remained an important component of the Arts and Crafts movement.</p>
<p>The Viennese architect and city planner Camillo Sitte was perhaps the most influential opponent of the international urban planning movement that was gathering momentum in the wake of Haussmann's transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name>. Sitte saw emulation of the medieval town square as a place-fixing remedy for the spa-<lb/>
tially diffuse modern city with its new wide, straight thoroughfares designed for rapid vehicular movement. Arts and Crafts aesthetics, later mingled with a painterly approach borrowed from the Impressionists, had an important influence on architec-<lb/>
ture in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially in Great Britain. Its Picturesque principles of design called for a
<pb n="376"/>
<pb n="376" type="orig"/>
continuation of handcrafted ornamentation of buildings, and this ran counter to the machine-age trend toward a faceless, abstract architecture based on the use of such new building materials as cast iron and glass.</p>
<p>Inevitably, Ruskin's towering influence was felt in the garden as well. Paxton's Crys-<lb/>
tal Palace in <name type="place">London</name>, which had so impressed the public in <date when="1851">1851</date>, conspicuously symbol-<lb/>
ized not only the Industrial Age architecture that Ruskin despised but also the Victorian enthusiasm for showy hybridized plants made possible by glasshouse horticulture. The Arts and Crafts movement that the fol-<lb/>
lowers of Ruskin and Morris carried forward numbered among its ranks several landscape professionals who saw the carpet-bedding practices of contemporary gardeners as vul-<lb/>
gar rote exercises. William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll were the foremost apostles of a new form of planting, which substituted a more casual and painterly approach employ-<lb/>
ing naturalized shrubs, wildflowers, and perennials for the Victorian gardener's for-<lb/>
mulaic flower beds. In fractious opposition to Robinson's advocacy of a naturalistic, picturesque style of gardening, the architect Regi-<lb/>
nald Blomfield set forth an approach oriented more toward architec-<lb/>
ture than painterly composition, which Blomfield labeled "formal."</p>
<p>The Edwardian Age now appears as the halcyon twilight of aristocratic pleasures&#x2014;garden parties, croquet games, lawn ten-<lb/>
nis&#x2014;in verdant settings beautifully maintained by large staffs of gardeners. In the pre-income-tax United States, industrial wealth generated fortunes that Beaux-Arts-trained designers displayed in Italianate gardens of the Country Place Era. The gardens commis-<lb/>
sioned by latter-day British aristocrats and wealthy Americans for their country estates or the venerable European ch&#x00E2;teaux and villas they and others restored were highly eclectic. Overall, they displayed their owners' and designers' appreciation of historic gardens, reintro-<lb/>
duction of intimate scale and spatial enclosure, use of topiary and other "old-fashioned" forms, and loose, naturalistic planting compo-<lb/>
sition in which color plays an important role. Whether derived from Arts and Crafts principles, Italianate and Beaux-Arts formality, or a combination of the naturalistic and the formal, the principal design premise of the Edwardian garden was one of sheer aestheticism; it was an expression of art for art's sake. As such, it represented no ideological set of values and existed only in the context of <hi rend="italic">style.</hi> It was, like the current obsession with expressing history in the land-<lb/>
scape, a consumer's option in which period style became itself a dominant cultural value. No longer bound to representation&#x2014;the re-presentation of ideas and beliefs through art&#x2014;design had become a matter of mere choice involving selection among several available historical styles. As such, it no longer expressed the philosophical or literary values of its own age, being instead a graceful echo of forms whose original meaning was now lost.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-455">

<figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.1. Kate Greenaway, watercolor illustration for the poem "Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?"</hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, the result of Herd-<lb/>
er's Romantic thesis a century earlier, with its emphasis on historical appreciation as a source of heightened meaning in contemporary life, was firmly rooted. Whether accomplished by talented amateurs or by the emerging professionals who called themselves landscape architects, garden design had become almost entirely self-referential. Landscape designs bore no messages other than those of a sentimental nature &#x2014; remembrances of flowers in Shakespeare's plays; charming evocations of "bygoneness," as in "Queen Anne" period gardens; or images evoking Kate Green-<lb/>
away's illustrations for children's books (fig. 11.1).</p>
<p>Because of its association with domes-<lb/>
ticity, the landscape design field was open earlier than others to women practitioners. In the estate gardens she designed, Beatrix Jones Farrand, one of the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects, drew upon the Arts and Crafts legacy of Jekyll; the work of Thomas Mawson, who combined Arts and Crafts garden style with Beaux-Arts planning principles; and a trav-<lb/>
eler's first-hand acquaintance with Italian villa gardens. Farrand's contemporary, Ellen Biddle Shipman, who had less opportunity to journey abroad and study examples of European landscape design, created original gardens that complemented the American Colonial Revival architecture then fashionable. In <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place">Florida</name>, landscape designers were especially eclectic, borrowing inspiration from Italian villas and harking to distant echoes of Islamic Spain as they sought to forge regional idioms based upon the sunny Mediter-<lb/>
ranean-type climate and Hispanic heritage found in these states. In both, a vegetal palette incorporating many species of semitropical plants made gardens exceptionally lush. <name type="place">California</name> designers also looked west across the Pacific, especially to <name type="place">Japan</name>, for inspiration.</p>
<p>Whether continuing the eclectic tradition of the Edwardians or subscribing to the tenets of modernism, landscape design was now a much more individualistic enterprise than before. Gardening was seen as an expression of personality, the domain of private dreams, and such it remains today, especially in those highly personal land-<lb/>
scapes often referred to as "vernacular." The Edwardian landscape's purposes were those of idyllic retreat or recreational refuge from the increasing freneticism of modern life. Being essentially a place of play, it had little concern for representing broadly shared philosoph-<lb/>
ical perspectives or displaying emblems of power. Moreover, Edwardian croquet lawns and tennis courts were but a foretaste of the garden's expanding role as a place of physical recreation, one that was to be extended to society at large by the many new public parks built in the twentieth century. Henceforth, as the old order of social hierarchy faded, its purpose was to serve the general welfare and become a commodity for mass consumption.</p>

<p>Baron Haussmann's modernization of the city of <name type="place">Paris</name> during the reign of Napoleon III was but the first example of thorough urban reconfiguration to accom-<lb/>
modate the new forces of accelerated movement brought about by the Industrial Age. Elsewhere in the second half of the nineteenth century cities were being similarly transformed. Vienna acquired a belt of fluid urban motion and monumental modern urbanism beginning in <date when="1857">1857</date> when Emperor Franz Josef I ordered the demolition of the fortifications walling the old city. The area of the glacis, the sloped terrain extending in front of the walls, which had long been controlled by the military, became a belt of open space available for new uses. The city, which was then administered by the liberal element of the bour-<lb/>
geoisie, employed the best Viennese architects of the second half of the nineteenth century to create the broad, landscaped Ringstrasse, a beltway with public green spaces and sites for important ecclesiastical, civic, and educational institutions and also for new residential buildings.</p>
<p>Though employing modern methods of con-<lb/>
struction, the architects of the Ringstrasse built in a medley of borrowed styles. They applied the Gothic style in designing the Rathaus, an attempt to associate this seat of municipal government with the pre-impe-<lb/>
rial medieval commune governed by burghers. By contrast, they deemed an early Baroque idiom appro-<lb/>
priate for the state theater, the Burgtheater, perhaps because it spoke of the time when commoners were first able to join courtiers in the enjoyment of the dra-<lb/>
matic arts. These structures, together with the neo-Re-<lb/>
naissance university and the Neoclassical Parliament buildings, the latter built as a gargantuan Greek tem-<lb/>
ple with vastly extended wings, were oriented to the broad expanse of the Ringstrasse. Contrary to the historic models they evoked, these works of architec-<lb/>
ture stood isolated, lacking the frame of well-defined public space. No medieval or Renaissance squares gave spatial enclosure and foreground perspective to the Rathaus or the university, and no monumental axes found their terminal points in the Burgtheater or the Parliament. Although the buildings were set in generously landscaped space, this further emphasized their isolation, heterogeneousness, and lack of visible containment. It was this loss of urban spatial coher-<lb/>
ence&#x2014;buildings and public spaces defined and visu-<lb/>
ally enhanced by one another&#x2014;that disturbed Camillo Sitte, the Austrian architect and city planner who sought to stem the tide of cultural disintegration and loss of community as the rich texture of old cities and towns built by human hands began to be super-<lb/>
seded by impersonal urban environments created by machine technology.</p>
<div type="subsection">

<p><name type="pname">Camillo Sitte</name> (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903">1903</date>) maintained a historicist vision that was embodied in Picturesque architectural principles, and he sought to stabilize urban space by replicating the square of the medieval and Renais-<lb/>
sance townscape. In <date when="1889">1889</date>, he published <hi rend="italic">Der St&#x00E4;dte-<lb/>
bau nach seinen kunstlerischen Grunds&#x00E4;tzen</hi>&#x2014;in its English translation, <hi rend="italic">The Art of Building Cities.</hi> This remarkable essay continues still to speak to those who address their attention to cityscapes and who, like Sitte, regret the sacrifice of urban design to traffic engineering and the substitution of technocratic util-<lb/>
itarian planning for artistic principles of urban com-<lb/>
position. In forming his critique, Sitte did not quarrel with eclectic architecture, as modernist architects soon would. Instead, he based his argument on an analysis of public spaces in classical and more recent historic times, before planning had been entrusted to government agency officials who had inevitably developed a systematic, formulaic approach to urban design. The Greek agora and the Roman forum had been vital centers of community life, and many of the Italian piazzas had evolved as satisfying assemblages of architecture, sculpture, and open space through an instinctive artistry spanning several generations. Nearer to home, the close-knit town life in the time of craft guilds evoked in <hi rend="italic">The Mastersingers</hi> by <name type="pname">Richard Wagner</name>, a composer whom Sitte greatly admired, provided an image of artisan values and community. Sitte included in his book several instructive dia-<lb/>
grams analyzing the configurations of cathedral squares in Nuremberg and other German and Aus-<lb/>
trian communities (fig. 11.2).</p>

</figure>
<p>One of the first to recognize and articulate the more open character of cities in the modern age as
<pb n="378"/>

well as their enlarged size and building scale, Sitte pointed out the failure of rational planning to provide a suitable urban habitat, citing Vienna's wide, wind-<lb/>
swept thoroughfares furnished with tiny islands for crossing pedestrians, its unenclosed new parks that lacked the feeling of tranquillity and protection found in old palace gardens, its division into blocks that emphasized street frontage at the expense of interior courtyard space, and the design of public squares as reservoirs of traffic, rather than as places for public life. Although he realized that the publication of newspapers diminished one of the functions of the square&#x2014;that of exchanging information&#x2014;and that market stalls had been supplanted by indoor shops, Sitte still believed that artistically arranged public squares were essential elements of community, nec-<lb/>
essary both visually and spiritually. Like Frederick Law Olmsted, he disliked the relentless grid that ignored topographic considerations and that failed to capture scenic opportunities. Haussmann's <name type="place">Paris</name>, though technocratic in its approach to planning and therefore conducive to the same monotonous banality that was beginning to afflict Vienna and other mod-<lb/>
ernizing cities, was improved in Sitte's eyes by its continuation of the Baroque tradition of terminating axes with monumental buildings, showing that "per-<lb/>
spective effects are possible even within the limita-<lb/>
tions imposed by practical considerations."<ref target="#CH11-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Sitte was willing to make concessions to util-<lb/>
ity, and he knew that modern cities needed system-<lb/>
atic planning with regard to transportation and sanitation. But he deplored the division of the unbuilt city into uniform blocks of land for real-es-<lb/>
tate speculation. Regarding the composition of pub-<lb/>
lic squares, he despised as dull the convention of centering monuments and applying symmetry as a uniform design principle. In short, the formulaic plan was his b&#x00EA;te noire. "Whoever is to succeed in upholding esthetic considerations in urban develop-<lb/>
ment must," he declared, "first, realize that practical solutions to traffic problems are not necessarily rigid, unalterable remedies; and secondly, he must be prepared to demonstrate that practical require-<lb/>
ments of modern living need not necessarily obstruct artful development."<ref target="#CH11-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In a final chapter, Sitte offered diagrammatic suggestions to enhance the existing Ringstrasse buildings through the reconfiguration of their sur-<lb/>
roundings as enclosed plazas. But his attempts to define a psychology of place&#x2014;like the opposite approach of his Viennese contemporary the architect Otto Wagner to aggrandize and regularize urban space&#x2014;remained a utopian vision influential only in academic and intellectual circles. As the head of the State Trade School, Sitte advanced his Arts and Crafts ideals from within the government bureaucracy, writ-<lb/>
ing on bookbinding, ceramics, fountain restoration, and other subjects that combined his love of the past with his sense of urgent need for the aesthetic imagi-<lb/>
nation to serve as a redemptive social force within the framework of contemporary capitalism.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">The Victorian War of Styles: William Robinson and Reginald Blomfield</hi></hi></head>
<p>In the realm of the English garden, William Robinson (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935">1935</date>) promoted an Arts and Crafts aesthetic at odds with the forces of scientific horticulture driv-<lb/>
ing much of the landscape design in his day. Like Capability Brown, Robinson was a working gardener who rose to a position of exceptional influence. Like John Claudius Loudon, he was effective in reaching a broad audience through the pages of his garden periodicals and books. But although Robinson shared Loudon's encyclopedic botanical knowledge, he saw plants more in artistic than in scientific terms, and he abhorred the Victorian style of carefully displayed specimen plants Loudon had championed and chris-<lb/>
tened the Gardenesque. For Loudon, admiration of an individual plant's form was a consideration equal in importance to its effect with other plants in the land-<lb/>
scape, and for flower beds or groupings of trees and shrubs he urged that each be planted near to, but not touching, its neighbor. Robinson, to the contrary, envisioned garden compositions with plants inter-<lb/>
mingled and sometimes intertwined as in wild nature. His style was within the Picturesque tradition at the time when the Picturesque's potential to create rich and varied scenes had been greatly expanded by the introduction of many new species of flowering plants.</p>
<p>Robinson's firm opinions on horticultural mat-<lb/>
ters, fluently expressed in peppery prose, soon led him to write for the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle.</hi> He was fortunate in being able to communicate his ideas to an expanding and congenial audience. The tremendous suburban growth around <name type="place">London</name> and other British cities at the end of the nineteenth century took the form of many hundreds of thousands of middle- and working-class homes with garden plots.<ref target="#CH11-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>With a cli-<lb/>
mate moist and temperate enough to grow a wide range of plant material, with long hours of summer daylight, and with sufficient money in the pockets of enough of its citizens to support a flourishing nursery trade, late Victorian and Edwardian <name type="place">England</name> became a nation of gardeners. Poor cottagers living in old rural villages obtained gifts of cuttings for their gar-<lb/>
dens, which they arranged randomly with little design forethought. There was, however, considerable charm in the vernacular landscape of cottagers' gardens, and Robinson saw them as a rich source of ideas that sub-<lb/>
<pb n="379"/>
<pb n="379" type="orig"/>
urban gardeners could use, particularly after he became acquainted with the garden-artist and crafts-<lb/>
woman Gertrude Jekyll, who appreciated cottage gar-<lb/>
dens as much as he did. The native landscape of fields, hedgerows, and woodland dells offered further inspiration (fig. 11.3). The growing number of field clubs and local scientific societies and the publication of handbooks on wildflowers testified to a broad gen-<lb/>
eral interest in nature among the British. Robinson incorporated into his recommendations many ideas gleaned from these sources as well as from his own rambles. Ruskin's view of nature as the root of truth and beauty and his belief in honorable craft as an anti-<lb/>
dote to crude mechanization added support for Rob-<lb/>
inson's and Jekyll's Arts and Crafts approach to garden design.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Alpine Flowers for English Gardens,</hi> published in <date when="1870">1870</date>, the same year as <hi rend="italic">The Wild Garden,</hi> told read-<lb/>
ers that the plants Robinson had seen growing in rocky crevices in the Alps could also flourish in English gardens. The continuing popularity of rock gardens was due in no small part to Robinson's per-<lb/>
suasiveness in promoting Alpine horticulture. Other writers had criticized bedding out of plants, promoted a floral version of the Picturesque, and urged garden-<lb/>
ers to study wildflowers and to emulate the effects of field and forest, but none had Robinson's flair as a publicist and none was as prolific as he. In <date when="1871">1871</date>, to further his views, he began publishing <hi rend="italic">The Garden,</hi> a long-lived weekly journal to which both Ruskin and Gertrude Jekyll contributed. This was followed by other periodicals: <hi rend="italic">Gardening Illustrated,</hi> begun in <date when="1879">1879</date>; <hi rend="italic">Cottage Gardening,</hi> started in <date when="1892">1892</date>; and <hi rend="italic">Flora and Sylva,</hi> published from <date when="1903">1903</date> until <date when="1905">1905</date>. Graphi-<lb/>
cally well designed and featuring handsome engrav-<lb/>
ings, these magazines provided a platform from which Robinson promoted rock gardens, wild garden-<lb/>
ing, and herbaceous borders. They provided a forum where he could fulminate against aspects of garden taste that he despised. One was the fashion for topiary, which had been revived in High Victorian gardens, notably Levens Hall and Elvaston Castle, and which was later advocated by Robinson's contemporary, the Ruskinian ecclesiastical architect-turned-gardener <name type="pname">John Dando Sedding</name> (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>), in <hi rend="italic">Garden-Craft Old and New</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>) (fig. 11.4). Contentious and opinionated, Robinson continued to advance his ideas in his magnum opus, <hi rend="italic">The English Flower Garden</hi> (<date when="1883">1883</date>). Through his conversational, commonsensical style and the vivid pictures he painted with words he won many readers, and the book ran to sixteen edi-<lb/>
tions.</p>
<p>Robinson was as zealous in his attack upon Reg-<lb/>
inald Blomfield (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1942">1942</date>), an architect and the author of <hi rend="italic">The Formal Garden in <name type="place">England</name></hi> (<date when="1892">1892</date>), as in his crusade against carpet bedding. Although Blomfield championed a return to the design formal-<lb/>
ity of the English garden in pre-Georgian times, he did not feel that designing in the manner of these old gardens was incompatible with Arts and Crafts prin-<lb/>
ciples. His principal argument rested upon the belief that house and garden should be united in a single plan in which landscape space was treated as an extension of the architecture of the house. Robinson, for his part, did not object to geometrical lines in the garden. For him, a rectangular flower bed was, like the rectangular stretcher supporting the canvas on which an artist paints a free-flowing landscape, a con-<lb/>
venient shape wherein the gardener's naturalistic effects could be displayed. Both men despised Wil-<lb/>
liam Andrew Nesfield's revival of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and the Italianate grandeur of the Crystal Palace Park at Sydenham. Blomfield, however, wanted to revive the classicism of Christopher Wren&#x2014;so much so that his style was jokingly called "Wrenaissance"&#x2014;and to return to the garden a sense of enclosure, making it an architectural arrangement of outdoor rooms parti-<lb/>
tioned by walls and hedges, proportioned in relation to the house, and employing the principles of symme-<lb/>
try in its layout. He perceived the unstructured natu-<lb/>
ralistic garden as an obstacle to this end. As bluntly opinionated as Robinson, he asserted dogmatically that "to suppose that love of nature is shown by trying to produce the effects of wild nature on a small scale in a garden is clearly absurd; anyone who loves natu-<lb/>
ral scenery will want the real thing; he will hardly be content to sit in his rockery and suppose himself to be among the mountains."<ref target="#CH11-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>To the author of <hi rend="italic">The Wild Garden</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Flowers for English Alpine Gardens</hi> these were fighting words.

The word <hi rend="italic">formal,</hi> with its con-<lb/>
notation of the geometric style, was the source of some confusion. To Robinson the horticulturist it should apply only "where the plants of a garden are

rigidly set out in geometrical design as in carpet-gar-<lb/>
dening and bedding-out." It was also for him, as for Blomfield, a synonym for <hi rend="italic">architectural,</hi> and he would confine the architect solely to designing houses and some necessary grading around them. Everything else was to be left to the discretion of the garden designer with his superior knowledge of horticulture and claim to artistic plantsmanship. Eventually the acrimony subsided, and each side could claim victory as Edwardian gardens became alternatively formal and revivalistic or informal and naturalistic. Increasingly, they were places where both geometrical lines and painterly flower borders were at home.</p>

<p>The Edwardian garden designer whose reputation has endured longest is Gertrude Jekyll (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1932">1932</date>), the first woman to act as a professional practitioner in the field. By good fortune, a young architect, Edwin Landseer Lutyens (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944">1944</date>), lived near her village of Godalming, just north of Munstead Heath in Sur-<lb/>
rey, the then-rural southern county that is now a heav-<lb/>
ily suburbanized part of metropolitan <name type="place">London</name>. Their friendship flourished on both a personal level and as a fruitful collaboration over several years. It was one that embodied both designers' deep respect for rural English vernacular building and gardening idioms. At the heart of their achievement was the conviction Jekyll undoubtedly conveyed to Lutyens regarding the importance of sensitive site planning.</p>
<p>As a girl, Jekyll read Ruskin's works avidly. Ruskin's deep respect for handicrafts and the artisan worker would remain a chief influence and moral guide for Jekyll the rest of her life. In <date when="1861">1861</date>, the same year William Morris started his crafts firm and a time when higher education was gradually opening to women, Jekyll enrolled in the South Kensington School of Art. Here she learned drawing and color theory and experienced the influence of Owen Jones, a crafts designer and student of Moorish, Italian, and Chinese ornament who had served as superintendent of the Great Exhibition of <date when="1851">1851</date> as well as joint direc-<lb/>
tor of decoration for the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. Introductions to both Ruskin and Morris, whose Inter-<lb/>
national Exhibition of his firm's craft products she had probably visited in <date when="1862">1862</date>, confirmed her in her course as an artist. She chose to be both a painter and a craftswoman, accepting many commissions for sil-<lb/>
ver jewelry, embroideries, and inlaid woodwork, although, as a well-to-do woman from a prominent family, she could not defy social convention by for-<lb/>
mally establishing herself in business. In <date when="1876">1876</date>, after her father's death, she went to live with her mother in Munstead House, where, with a nature that craved a large degree of privacy and tranquillity, she was happy to continue her arts and crafts pursuits in the rural quietude of Surrey.</p>
<p>In <date when="1883">1883</date>, Jekyll purchased a 15-acre triangular plot of land opposite Munstead House, "fifteen acres of the poorest possible soil," the site of her garden and future home, Munstead Wood. Here she began devel-<lb/>
oping a garden of woodland walks. She was severely afflicted by myopia&#x2014;nearsightedness&#x2014;and as this condition progressed, she was forced to abandon even close work. By <date when="1891">1891</date>, her physician's prognosis of further deterioration caused her to throw more of her considerable artistic energy into gardening, which she was already pursuing with passionate interest. With the help of her brother she had taken up photography a few years earlier, and this gave her another visual medium of expression.</p>
<p>The hyphenated appellation <hi rend="italic">artist-gardener</hi> per-<lb/>
fectly suits Jekyll. Her blurry distance vision may possibly have assisted her in conceiving garden schemes less in terms of individual plants than as shapes, textures, and broad masses of color with sin-<lb/>

advantage in long drifts along a diagonal to the path (fig. 11.5). Like the Impressionist Claude Monet (<date when="1840">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1926">1926</date>), who was simultaneously creating his garden at Giverny both as a painterly expression in horticulture and a subject to be painted, Jekyll saw her garden as a series of seasonal scenes, appearing like pictures in a gallery with different exhibitions planned throughout the year. Not for her were Loudon's botan-<lb/>
ically ordered plant specimens. Glass houses, pride-<lb/>
fully displayed in Victorian gardens, were removed in hers to hidden corners to serve purely practical ends. Her gardener's credo, expressed in <hi rend="italic">Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden</hi> (<date when="1914">1914</date>), was deceptively sim-<lb/>

tured by her career as a garden columnist, first with the <hi rend="italic">Guardian Newspaper</hi> and later as a contributor to Wil-<lb/>
liam Robinson's magazine <hi rend="italic">The Garden,</hi> which she coedited for a brief period following his retirement in <date when="1899">1899</date>. She wrote the section on color for <hi rend="italic">The English Flower Garden,</hi> which was republished in several sub-<lb/>
sequent editions of Robinson's popular book, and she contributed photographs of plants to serve as the basis of engravings in all editions after the second. In <date when="1899">1899</date>, drawing material from her <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> columns, she published a book of her own, <hi rend="italic">Wood and Garden.</hi> She illustrated it with sixty-five of her own photographs, including many she had taken of cottagers at work in their gardens and woodmen competently felling trees with the time-honored tools she admired. Her prose is sensuous and vivid, and seasonal change, with the rhythm of the agrarian calendar dictating the garden-<lb/>
er's rounds, remains a theme in all her books.</p>
<p>Book publication brought Jekyll increased celebrity and assisted her in building a design practice with her architect, friend, and prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;, Edwin Lutyens. Their common aesthetic grew as he rode with her in a pony cart through the byways of Surrey admiring ver-<lb/>
nacular architecture. In Lutyens, Jekyll felt she had found someone whom she could trust to provide the elements of architectonic structure and domestic com-<lb/>
fort needed to complement her visions of nature per-<lb/>
fected. He, in turn, was grateful to his sometimes overbearing, but immensely helpful mentor, who imparted to him her Ruskinian sympathies, Arts and Crafts ideals, and deep appreciation of a vanishing <name type="place">England</name>. His genius lay in his ability to fuse these elements with an architectural style that embodied many of the formal principles enunciated by Blom-<lb/>
field.</p>
<p>Socially conservative, Jekyll wanted to preserve the old class structure of masters and servants. But far from wishing to make the humble cottages of rural villages disappear from the improved landscape, as had been the case in the eighteenth century when lands were enclosed and great estate gardens such as Stowe created, she was in the vanguard of British her-<lb/>
itage preservation. Even as an ancient way of life was succumbing to the modern age of industrialization, she wanted to save its building and craft traditions and to incorporate their techniques of brick, stone, and ironwork, along with the rustic charm of cottage gar-<lb/>
dens, into the style she and Lutyens were forging together. She also wanted to record the folkways and old agricultural methods that represented a venerable craft tradition even as new farm machinery and aspi-<lb/>
rations to transcend village poverty were causing these to vanish.</p>

<p>In much the same way as the French photogra-<lb/>

<p>In <date when="1895">1895</date>, following her mother's death when Mun-<lb/>
stead House became home to her brother and his fam-<lb/>
ily, and thirteen years after Jekyll had begun to garden on her adjacent property, she was ready to build a house, Munstead Wood, on the site she had reserved for it (fig. 11.7). In <hi rend="italic">Gardens for Small Country Houses</hi> (<date when="1912">1912</date>) Jekyll and her coauthor Lawrence Weaver wrote of the "right relation of the garden to the house," stating that "the connection must be intimate, and the access not only convenient but inviting."<ref target="#CH11-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref>At Munstead Wood, house and garden join in a mutual embrace. The house opens itself to the garden and incorporates the garden into its Paved Court, which is constructed of the same local stone as the house and edged with low boxwood hedges. At the north end of the Paved Court is the Tank Garden, where a rectangular pool is framed by stepped paving and lush plantings of ferns and canna lilies. Semicircular aprons of paving on either side of the pool mark the end of this formal construction where two garden paths, the Nut Walk and the path beside the October Michaelmas daisy border, lead to a Pergola and Summerhouse, beyond which lies Jekyll's 180-foot-(54.9-meter) long Main Flower Border, Gar-<lb/>
den of Summer Flowers, and Spring Garden.</p>
<p>The south and west sides of the house face a lawn and the adjoining woodland where, according to Jekyll, "much care has been given to the regions where the one melts into the other."<ref target="#CH11-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> The principal path on the south is a wide grassy way, which Jekyll constructed to have as its focal point a handsome Scotch fir that, being dou-<lb/>
ble-stemmed, had not been cut when the property was a woodlot. Masses of rhododendrons carefully selected for their floral color were underplanted with hardy ferns, small andromedas, wild heaths, and the blue-flowered <hi rend="italic">Lithospermum prostratum.</hi> Lesser paths formed a series of woodland walks, along which patches of trillium, drifts of Solomon's seal, and spires of white foxglove enhanced the impression of wild nature in its most gen-<lb/>
erous state.</p>
<p>Jekyll's camera recorded many beautiful garden pictures at Munstead Wood over the years. Because of her growing reputation as a garden writer and photog-<lb/>
rapher, she met Edward Hudson, the publisher, who, in <date when="1897">1897</date>, launched <hi rend="italic">Country Life,</hi> the first garden magazine
<pb n="383"/>
<pb n="383" type="orig"/>
to feature coated paper to enhance the imagery of half-tone photographs. Jekyll began writing for<hi rend="italic"> Coun-<lb/>
try Life</hi> in <date when="1901">1901</date>, and her subsequent books were pub-<lb/>
lished under the <hi rend="italic">Country Life</hi> imprint. Although the magazine showcased many great estates, Jekyll's participation added greater horticultural content and a focus upon small country houses, domestic estab-<lb/>
lishments like her own Munstead Wood where the owner substituted for a head gardener in directing the work of a small gardening staff. Her first article described Orchards, the house and garden that she and Lutyens were then completing for her neighbors <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Julia</name> Chance, a virtuosic combination of Lutyens's architectural imagination and Jekyll's painterly sensibility (fig. 11.8).</p>
<p>In <date when="1898">1898</date>, following the Orchards commission, Lutyens crossed the English Channel to design Les Bois des Moutiers at <name type="place">Varengeville</name> on the Normandy coast for the Anglophile banker <name type="pname">Guillaume Mallet</name> (fig. 11.9).<ref target="#CH11-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref>Imbued, like Jekyll, with the aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts movement, Mallet sought inspira-<lb/>
tion for the exquisitely harmonized floral tones of his superb collection of rhododendrons from medieval stained glass as well as from his collection of old embroidered fabrics, mostly clerical vestments. From Jekyll's <hi rend="italic">Wood and Garden</hi> he derived the idea of introducing into the park Chinese azaleas (<hi rend="italic">Azalea mollis</hi>) in a succession of carefully graded tones rang-<lb/>
ing from pale yellow to bright orangy red.</p>
<p>The Jekyll-Lutyens collaboration continued until her advancing age and his rise to professional prominence, culminating in a knighthood, brought it to a gradual halt. Increasingly, Lutyens moved toward formality while still maintaining his originality as an architect. Although conceived in the so-called Anglo-Indian style, his plan for New Delhi, the gov-<lb/>
ernment capital the British built south of Delhi between <date when="1912">1912</date> and <date when="1931">1931</date>, was akin in its Beaux-Arts classicism to the contemporary planning in <name type="place">America</name> that was being promoted as the City Beautiful.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Blomfield's revaluation of seven-<lb/>
teenth-century British gardens was the practice in <name type="place">France</name> of <name type="pname">Henri Duch&#x00EA;ne</name> (<date when="1841">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902">1902</date>) and his son <name type="pname">Achille Duch&#x00EA;ne</name> (<date when="1866">1866</date>&#x2013;<date when="1947">1947</date>), which drew upon that nation's immense seventeenth-century patrimony as defined by Le Nôtre. The restored <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs that we see today at Vaux-le-Vicomte are the work of Henri Duch&#x00EA;ne (<date when="1897">1897</date>) and Achille Duch&#x00EA;ne (<date when="1910">1910</date>) (see fig. 5.4 ). At Champs-sur-Marne the father and son erased th<hi rend="italic">e jardin anglais</hi> that had been superim-<lb/>
posed upon a seventeenth-century plan, reestablish-<lb/>
ing the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi> as two fine panels of flowing arabesques. Recognizing the Duch&#x00EA;nes' expertise in resurrecting this lost art with a particular crispness of line, the ninth duke of Marlborough (<date when="1892">1892</date>&#x2013;<date when="1934">1934</date>) commissioned Achille to restore the north forecourt at Blenheim as a <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden. Duch&#x00EA;ne then went on to design formal gardens to the east and west of the palace, the latter with two water terraces. Perhaps his most successful design was the beautiful restoration of the park surrounding the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;-<lb/>
teau</hi> of Courances in Essonne, <name type="place">France</name>, in the years prior to World War I as a small <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and series of spring-fed canals and pools framed by <hi rend="italic">palissades</hi> and noble trees, with a small cascade rippling from the base of a sculpture of a reclining nymph (fig. 11.10). Although Duch&#x00EA;ne, an arch-conservative French nationalist, deplored the Industrial Age and the democratization of culture that spelled an end to the aristocratic tradition of garden making he had sought
<pb n="384"/>
<pb n="384" type="orig"/>
to reestablish among a waning nobility, he nonetheless tried to fit his talent to the demands of the twentieth century with its smaller properties, mastering an idiom of carefully scaled, finely detailed forms he termed <hi rend="italic">jardin d'architecture.</hi></p>

</figure>
<p>At Villandry, a moated sixteenth-century <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> overlooking the river Cher within the Loire Valley a few miles west of Tours, its twentieth-century owner Dr. Joachim de Carvallo (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1936">1936</date>) undertook a gar-<lb/>
den construction project between <date when="1906">1906</date> and <date when="1924">1924</date> to replace the nineteenth-century <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais,</hi> which he associated with cultural democratization, with a Renaissance-evoking design that upheld his own belief in class hierarchy and social order. This three-level garden, a popular stop on the Loire Valley tourist cir-<lb/>
cuit, manages to convey the intricate compartmental-<lb/>
ization, meticulous order, and sense of containment within well-defined boundaries that are characteristic of Renaissance design.</p>
<p>Its <hi rend="italic">potager</hi> is a geometrical <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> composed of nine large squares filled with lettuces and other vege-<lb/>
tables of varied hues, arranged in a pattern derived from studying the sixteenth-century ch&#x00E2;teau garden layouts of Jacques Androuet du Cerceau (fig. 11.11, see figs. 4.40, 4.41, 4.42, 4.43, 4.44). The corners of each square are punctuated with the style of trelliswork arbors characteristic of Renaissance gardens, and today these are covered with roses.</p>
<p>The iconography of Villandry's noteworthy Jar-<lb/>
din d'Ornement has more to do with late-nine-<lb/>
teenth-century opera or nascent twentieth-century Surrealism than with the themes of Renaissance humanism (fig. 11.12). In one of its four compartments the topiary box represent hearts, flames, and masks symbolizing <hi rend="italic">l'amour tendre,</hi> or tender love; in another butterflies and fans hint of <hi rend="italic">l'amour volage,</hi> fickle love; a third is a labyrinth of hearts denoting <hi rend="italic">l'amour folie,</hi> blind passion; and the last contains sword and dagger
<pb n="385"/>
<pb n="385" type="orig"/>
blades characterizing <hi rend="italic">l'amour tragique,</hi> tragic love. In spite of this amusingly original interpretation of Renais-<lb/>
sance garden design and perhaps because of a level of maintenance comparable to the time when battalions of gardeners were commonplace, the visitor almost feels transported to a distant age. An <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> of lime trees defines the garden's main axis, which separates the two gardens just described from the Jardin d'Eau above with its ver-<lb/>
dant lawns, ornamental pool, fountain basins, and canal.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude-Nicolas Forestier (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1930">1930</date>), Achille Duch&#x00EA;ne's and Dr. Joachim de Carvallo's con-<lb/>
temporary, had a less reactionary temperament and res-<lb/>
torationist bent. His was a flexible style that mediated between several trends: a return to Neoclassical formal-<lb/>
ity, the legacy of <hi rend="italic">the jardin anglais,</hi> an Arts and Crafts aesthetic, and the innovations of modernism. As an employee of the <name type="place">Paris</name> Parks and Promenades administra-<lb/>
tion after <date when="1887">1887</date>, Forestier restored Thomas Blaikie's late-eighteenth-century <hi rend="italic">jardin-anglais</hi> on the grounds of Bagatelle as a public park, leaving in place some of the garden's remaining<hi rend="italic"> fabriques</hi> and reintroducing French formality in the more architectonic lines of the new perennial and rose gardens (fig. 11.13). Forestier was also responsible for restoring Sceaux, the masterful land-<lb/>
scape Le Nôtre had created for Colbert (see fig. 5.16). But his style ranged beyond that of French and English inspiration, incorporating such Islamic and Mediterra-<lb/>
nean features as patios and patterned tiles. This eclecti-<lb/>
cism was nourished by Forestier's international landscape practice. Like Duch&#x00EA;ne, Forestier grappled with the chal-<lb/>
lenge of designing gardens for the relatively small-scale private properties of a still wealthy but less landed clien-<lb/>
tele. His ability to amalgamate an Arts and Crafts horti-<lb/>
cultural palette, formal elements derived from Renaissance garden tradition, and Mediterranean and Islamic motifs in an original manner can be seen in the garden he designed for the Parque de Montjuich (Mont-<lb/>
ju&#x00EF;c) in Barcelona in <date when="1918">1918</date> (fig. 11.14).</p>

<p>The merger of an Arts and Crafts aesthetic with Neoclas-<lb/>

als and local scenery was part of a general stylistic trend adopted by various architects, landscape designers, and aesthetes well into the twentieth century. In addition to countering industrialization and mass production with arti-<lb/>

ist effort to uphold English vernacular traditions. Even so, this commitment to "Englishness" was being undermined by Beaux-Arts influence in much the same way as the American style of Olmsted and Vaux was being chal-<lb/>

<p>The thatched cottages of the Cotswolds and the gar-<lb/>
dens of Surrey, with their hollyhocks and roses, seemed excessively quaint to some Englishmen like Harold Ainsworth Peto (<date when="1854">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1933">1933</date>) who sought statelier Con-<lb/>
tinental examples as inspiration for a landscape style that expressed their art-for-art's-sake philosophy in different terms from those of the English vernacular tradition. They saw the sixteenth-century and early-seven-<lb/>
teenth-century villas of <name type="place">Italy</name> as models to emulate. Peto developed Italian themes in his own garden at Ilford Manor, near Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, gaining the admiration of Jekyll, who included some of his design details in her book <hi rend="italic">Garden Ornament</hi> (<date when="1918">1918</date>). At Ilford Manor and in the gardens he designed for clients, Peto terraced slopes, marked grade changes with balustrades atop retaining walls, created graceful staircases with side walls terminating in finial-topped pillars or columns holding antique statuary, and built casinos and colon-<lb/>
nades overlooking tanks of water lilies (fig. 11.15). In their sensitive use of native stone; in their employment of a subdued floral palette as a complement to evergreen
<pb n="386"/>
<pb n="386" type="orig"/>
shrubs and trees; and in their siting with respect to their surroundings, Peto's gardens demonstrate a discrimi-<lb/>
nating assimilation of Italian themes to English land-<lb/>
scape tradition. In several gardens he showed that he could manipulate water, one of the principal ingredients of Italian gardens, with considerable originality. At Har-<lb/>
tham Park in Wiltshire, around <date when="1903">1903</date>, he built a long canal and a casino modeled on one of the pair next to the Fountain of the Deluge at the sixteenth-century Villa Lante. At Garinish Island at the head of Bantry Bay in County Cork, <name type="place">Ireland</name>, against the scenic back-<lb/>
drop of Sugarloaf Mountain, he brought the lush vege-<lb/>

<p>Americans, too, including the artist <name type="pname">Charles Platt</name> (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1933">1933</date>), saw Italian villas as a source of inspira-<lb/>
tion for the country houses their affluent countrymen were building on the North Shore of Long Island, in the Berkshires in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, and at Newport, Rhode Island. In this period, which has come to be known as the Country Place Era, American heirs to large fortunes were marrying British aristocrats with some regularity, and there was a great deal of cultural correspondence between the members of high society in both countries. The American and English love affair with <name type="place">Italy</name> was such that many expatriates took up residence in Tus-<lb/>
cany and elsewhere in <name type="place">Italy</name>. These included Arthur Acton, owner of La Pietra in Florence; Lady Sybil Cut-<lb/>
ting, who presided over the Villa Medici in Fiesole; and Gertrude Jekyll's older sister Caroline, who married Frederic Eden and with him and advice from Gertrude created an English-inflected Italian garden behind the high walls surrounding their palazzina on the Giudecca in <name type="place">Venice</name>.</p>
<p>Beginning with <hi rend="italic"><name type="pname">Roderick Hudson</name></hi> (<date when="1875">1875</date>), the nov-<lb/>
elist <name type="pname">Henry James</name> wrote about the expatriate life of this generation, its high ideals of beauty, and its determina-<lb/>

noisseurship. In <date when="1900">1900</date>, James's fellow American, the art historian Bernard Berenson (<date when="1865">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959">1959</date>), took up res-<lb/>
idence at the Villa I Tatti near <name type="place">Settignano</name>, a village close to Florence. While serving as agent to <name type="pname">Isabella Stewart Gardner</name> in assembling her Venetian palazzo and art col-<lb/>
lection in <name type="place">Boston</name>, Berenson commissioned the English architect Cecil Ross Pinsent (<date when="1884">1884</date>&#x2013;<date when="1963">1963</date>) to design at I Tatti an Italian-style garden with a <hi rend="italic">limonaia</hi> and clipped box hedges (fig. 11.17). Pinsent was also responsible for modifying the seventeenth-century gardens for Acton at La Pietra and the fifteenth-century gardens for Lady Sybil at the Villa Medici (see figs. 4.2,4.3). Later, between <date when="1924">1924</date> and <date when="1939">1939</date>, he worked with Lady Sybil's daughter, writer Iris Origo, on the design of the gardens of La Foce, her estate south of Siena.</p>
<p>The English and American interest in old Italian villa gardens was reflected in several books on the sub-<lb/>

Sir George Reresby Sitwell (<date when="1860">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1943">1943</date>) in <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Making of Gardens, A Study of Old Italian Gardens, of the Nature of Beauty, and the Principles Involved in Garden Design</hi> (<date when="1909">1909</date>) wrote lyrically about the more than 200 Italian gardens he had visited and of his appli-<lb/>

<p>In much the way that Jekyll had become a photo-<lb/>

<p>Novelist <name type="pname">Edith Wharton</name> (<date when="1862">1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1937">1937</date>) also fos-<lb/>
tered an American appreciation of Italian gardens. Commissioned by the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> magazine to write a series of articles titled <hi rend="italic">Italian Villas and Their Gar-<lb/>
dens,</hi> she published these as a book with illustrations by the popular American artist <name type="pname">Maxfield Parrish</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1966">1966</date>) in <date when="1904">1904</date>. In this volume she deftly recorded the appearance of several of the Italian gar-<lb/>
dens described here in Chapters Four and Five. Their lines softened by lichened stone and overgrown veg-<lb/>
etation in a way that was agreeable to eyes trained to appreciate the Picturesque, these venerable land-<lb/>
scapes still offered Wharton much inspiration regard-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Both Platt</name> and <name type="pname">Wharton</name> understood that com-<lb/>
partmentalized gardens&#x2014;and the opportunities for concealment, surprise, and spatial intimacy they offered&#x2014;constituted the essence of Italian garden design. At The Mount, her summer home on a knoll overlooking Laurel Lake in Lenox, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, Wharton set about designing a <name type="place">New England</name> version of an Italian garden (fig. 11.19). Her niece, the land-<lb/>
scape designer <name type="pname">Beatrix Farrand</name> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959">1959</date>), pre-<lb/>
pared plans for the entrance drive and kitchen garden. Drawing on her intimate knowledge of Ital-<lb/>
ian gardens but wishing to establish an American version appropriate to the topography and traditions of <name type="place">New England</name>, Wharton laid out a series of grassy terraces bordered with hemlock hedges, which she linked axially to the house. She connected these to a long cross axis, a 300-foot-long (91.4-meter-long) walk bordered by linden trees with a <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden at either end, one of which was a large red flower garden with a dolphin fountain in the center and the other a sunken <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi> built with the pro-<lb/>
ceeds of Wharton's successful novel <hi rend="italic">The House of Mirth</hi> (<date when="1905">1905</date>). Heir to <name type="pname">Robinson</name> and <name type="pname">Jekyll</name> as well as the idylls of <name type="place">Italy</name>, she also planted an Alpine garden on a slope studded with natural outcrops of lime-<lb/>
stone.</p>
<p>The garden's real beauty lay not so much in these elements as in the overall impression it achieved in unison with its surroundings. Wharton may have been describing The Mount with its broad views of Laurel Lake and the Tyringham Hills when her heroine in <hi rend="italic">The House of Mirth,</hi> Lily Bart, leans pensively against a terrace balustrade gazing at

a landscape tutored to the last degree of rural elegance. In the foreground glowed the warm tints of the gardens. Beyond the lawn, with its pyramidal pale-gold maples and velvety firs, sloped pastures dotted with cattle; and through a long glade the river widened like a lake under the silver light of September.<ref target="#CH11-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Like Blomfield, Platt was interested in uniting architectural and landscape space. This was what the Italian villa designers, who conceived of house and garden as integral parts of a single plan, had done. In Cornish, New Hampshire, the summer art colony of which Platt was a member, he developed on five properties, including his own, an American version of the Italian villa, in which he created axial alignments, descending terraced slopes, and garden spaces shaped by architectural greenery as outdoor living rooms.</p>
<p>Between <date when="1896">1896</date> and <date when="1901">1901</date>, at Faulkner Farm in Brookline, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, Platt designed a garden
<pb n="388"/>
<pb n="388" type="orig"/>
for <name type="pname">Charles Sprague</name> and <name type="pname">Mary Pratt Sprague</name> (fig. 11.20). The steep grade of the site was conducive to creating a gridded <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> with a circular temple in the center on the hillside above the entry court and on axis with the principal entrance to the house. Below the house, Platt designed the spacious lawn as a tran-<lb/>
sition between garden and forest, taking advantage of the slope to create a series of descending grass terraces overlooking the western range of hills. As Olmsted had done at Biltmore and Moraine Farm, Platt withheld this panoramic view from immediate sight by placing a screen of densely planted trees alongside the long entrance drive on both sides of the entry court. He had lamented the decay of many of the flower-filled <hi rend="italic">giardini segreti</hi> that had once vivi-<lb/>
fied Italian gardens, and now at Faulkner Farm he laid out a large rectangular flower garden terminat-<lb/>
ing at the far end in a horseshoe-shaped pergola and pavilion modeled, like those designed by Peto, on one of Cardinal Gambera's at Villa Lante (fig. 11.21).</p>

<p>Much admired and extensively published, Faulkner Farm launched Platt's career as a designer of houses and gardens that met the demand for what was hailed at the time as a new American landscape architecture. Italian-inspired, enriched by Arts and Crafts plantsmanship, the relaxed, historically evoc-<lb/>
ative style that Platt helped create adapted a bor-<lb/>
rowed idiom to the American scene. As the republican values of the generation of Downing and Olmsted were replaced by those of the Gilded Age, the Italianate style became an expression of the cul-<lb/>
tural status of the successful industrialists and finan-<lb/>
ciers who saw themselves as the successors of the Italian princes of the Renaissance, the collectors of artworks commissioned by the Medicis. Now, in democratic <name type="place">America</name>, these latter-day Medicis had become builders of city palaces and country villas. Beaux-Arts training and <name type="place">Rome</name> prize fellowships at the American Academy continued to be the primary path of career preparation for architects and land-<lb/>
scape architects in the United States until World War II. For this reason one finds both in the planning of public parks and in the gardens of private estates a long-lingering debt to the principles of this style of neoclassical design.</p>

<p>The incomprehensibility of vast social change as the entire religious and cultural underpinnings of a once-stable society is swept away by great tidal forces in the history of human affairs and the life of the human mind is the subject of Matthew Arnold's great, sad poem "Dover Beach" (<date when="1867">1867</date>). Its intima-<lb/>
tion of Western civilization's confusion and disarray was hardly heeded by Arnold's countrymen, the prosperous British aristocrats and industrialists who felt secure in the glory of their nation's empire over which a never-setting sun still shone.</p>
<p>But the Faustian power unleashed by the Indus-<lb/>
trial Revolution, the source of much economic pros-<lb/>
perity, was demoniacally driving the science of war toward new and hideous ends of destruction while also propelling the great social transformations fore-<lb/>
seen by Karl Marx. Nevertheless, from the perspec-<lb/>
tive of those living at the turn of the twentieth century, the tragic upheaval of World War I and the Russian Revolution still lay a few years in the future, and even as these came to pass there were those whose fortunes survived. Before turning in Chapter Twelve to examine the landscapes of a visionary modernity as Western societies became more broadly democratic in the wake of their social transforma-<lb/>
tions, we will examine a few more of the estate gar-<lb/>
<pb n="389"/>
<pb n="389" type="orig"/>
dens of this lingering aristocracy. Reduced in scale as new taxes eroded many old fortunes and rising labor costs curtailed maintenance budgets, these ear-<lb/>
ly-twentieth-century landscapes were still gracious if no longer grand.</p>
<p>World War I brought the era of country-house building to a halt in <name type="place">England</name> and ended what has been called the Edwardian Golden Afternoon&#x2014;a time when a privileged segment of society enjoyed garden teas, lawn tennis, and touring quiet country roads by bicycle and another new machine of the Industrial Age, the motor car. Still, Lutyens and Jekyll continued to collaborate. Now, however, when the two old friends worked together, it was on plans for soldiers' cemeteries, as the Imperial War Graves Commission had appointed Lutyens, along with Blomfield, principal architect for the ones in <name type="place">France</name>. But the domestic garden design idiom Jekyll and Lutyens had earlier forged was one that would serve well the postwar generation of estate owners, whose smaller properties and budgets did not allow the large-scale efforts of prior periods. The Arts and Crafts tradition pioneered by Robinson and the Jekyll-Lutyens partnership as it was fused with the Beaux-Arts style and the influence of Italian gardens found many notable expressions in the first half of the twentieth century. The style extends to the pres-<lb/>
ent day, and many of its finest practitioners were and are women. In part this was because the association of landscape architecture with the domestic realm made it seem more socially acceptable than female employment in some other professions.</p>
<p>With the writings of <name type="pname">Robinson</name>, <name type="pname">Jekyll</name>, and <name type="pname">Blomfield</name> and the lessons of Italian villa garden designers thoroughly assimilated and harmonized, the character of the early-twentieth-century English garden was now an agreeable stylistic amalgam of influences in which abundant, painterly herbaceous borders were happily incorporated into plans disci-<lb/>
plined by architectonic principles. With unbounded prospect no longer necessarily possible or desirable as privacy and enclosure became design objectives once more, the eighteenth century's premium on unbroken openness was thoroughly invalidated. Although some naturalistic planting was found use-<lb/>
ful in blending the edges of the garden with the larger landscape beyond, Capability Brown, who had served before as a target of criticism for those advo-<lb/>
cating a different landscape style, came in for cen-<lb/>
sure once again. It was a backward-looking time in which innovation lay in cherishing the British medi-<lb/>
eval and Tudor past and harmonizing this native her-<lb/>
itage in an aesthetically agreeable manner with elements borrowed from the historic period styles of other countries.</p>
<div type="subsection">

<p>In his influential book <hi rend="italic">The Art and Craft of Garden Making</hi> (<date when="1900">1900</date>), <name type="pname">Thomas Hayton Mawson</name> (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2014; <date when="1933">1933</date>) professed the notion of landscape design as a careful selection from a menu of styles. Mawson, the first Englishman to style himself a "landscape archi-<lb/>
tect," championed the "idealists," that is "old garden designers [who created] many stately avenues, grand parterres, quiet alleys, shady walks, sparking foun-<lb/>
tains, quaint hedges, architectural ponds and broad unbroken lawns, which in many cases are wedded together in such a masterly way, as to impress the spectator with the grandeur and transparent honesty of the whole scheme."<ref target="#CH11-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>Brown, on the other hand, was chief among the "realists," who tried to imitate nature but came to rely on serpentine lines to the point where "undulation became a stock accomplish-<lb/>
ment." Mawson admired Repton, however&#x2014;not the earlier Picturesque landscape gardener, but rather the later advocate of the "Gardenesque."</p>
<p>Mawson promoted a return to the "truthful sim-<lb/>
plicity" of old gardens. He acknowledged, however, that "naturalism has, under certain conditions, its legitimate use and place in the creation of garden and park effects; and that a compromise between these two opposites or a combination of the two is at times the only method by which we can obtain anything like an effective whole."<ref target="#CH11-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>Mawson's illustrations were more eclectic than Italianate. His style can best be summarized as a combination of Arts and Crafts flowers and topiary, Beaux-Arts unification of house and garden through axial planning, and the merging of these two influences with the curvilinear "natu-<lb/>
ralesque," as he called the informal style of garden design (fig. 11.22).</p>

<p>Another creator of the romantically expressive Edwardian garden was <name type="pname">Norah Lindsay</name> (<date when="1873">1873</date>&#x2013;<date when="1948">1948</date>), whose flair for creating "pictures" was akin to Jekyll's. At Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire, her home after <date when="1895">1895</date>, she created a series of garden compartments divided by stone walls and yew hedges. There was a Horn-<lb/>
beam Alley, a Persian Garden, and a Long Garden filled with topiary. Lindsay, who valued serendipity, admitted into her gardens a good deal of volunteer vegetation&#x2014;attractive weeds&#x2014;because they added an element of charming surprise (fig. 11.23). In the tradition of Robinson and Jekyll, she also created a wild garden, and, like Jekyll, served as a garden con-<lb/>
sultant to friends. She belongs to a special class of gardener whose passionate attachment to a particular place and to garden art amounts to a source of ecstasy. Writing in <hi rend="italic">Country Life</hi> in <date when="1931">1931</date>, Lindsay rhapsodized about Sutton Courtenay's "old sun-burnt walls. . . wreathed in wistaria tassels; the moonlit evenings when the turf is dry and warm, covered in rose petals like strange exotic shells; and the scent of syringa and honeysuckle weaves invisible webs of sweetness across one's dreaming face."<ref target="#CH11-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Although the garden at Sutton Courtenay did not survive, Lindsay's advice left an imprint on several extant gardens, including the deeply imaginative gar-<lb/>
den by <name type="pname">Lawrence Johnston</name> (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x2013;<date when="1958">1958</date>) at Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire. In <date when="1907">1907</date>, Johnston, an Amer-<lb/>
ican educated at <name type="pname">Oxford</name>, became the proprietor of <name type="pname">Hidcote Bartrin</name>, a 280-acre property in Chipping Campden. Here he proceeded to create a series of beautifully articulated architectural spaces, eschewing the quaintness of his Cotswolds milieu in favor of a plan that was both boldly original and highly fastidi-<lb/>
<pb n="391"/>
<pb n="391" type="orig"/>
ous (fig. 11.24). With the instincts of a <name type="pname">Le Nôtre</name> for optical perspective and proportional geometries, he used farm machinery to grade the land, manipulating the topography to achieve different ground levels and to play tricks of foreshortening by creating barely per-<lb/>
ceptible slopes, as in the case of the grassy walk through the Red Borders to the twin pavilions guard-<lb/>
ing the entrance to the Stilt Garden (fig. 11.25). Spa-<lb/>
tial definition is one of the chief assets of Hidcote, and the pleasurable scale of the garden is enhanced by the way in which Johnston formed "walls" with hedges of yew, holly, box, and beech, interweaving them to provide different textures and shades of green.</p>
<p>The architectural lines of the garden form a foil for the perennial plants, which <name type="pname">Johnston</name>, benefiting from Norah Lindsay's counsel, arranged in unusual and effective combinations, allowing his garden some of the same careless luxuriance and surprising juxta-<lb/>
positions as hers. He became an avid botanist, travel-<lb/>
ing to Africa and China to gamer rarities that he could naturalize at Hidcote. Color was an important consid-<lb/>
eration. In Mrs. Winthrop's Garden, named in honor of his mother, he planted only yellow-flowered plants and those with golden-hued leaves (fig. 11.26).</p>
<p>Victoria "Vita" Sackville-West (<date when="1892">1892</date>&#x2013;<date when="1962">1962</date>) and her husband, Sir Harold Nicholson (<date when="1886">1886</date>&#x2013;<date when="1968">1968</date>) employed the same combination of classically derived architectural lines and romantically artistic planting beds as those at Hidcote in the garden they created beginning in <date when="1930">1930</date> at Sissinghurst, their estate in Kent (fig. 11.27).</p>
<p>Various published accounts have generated con-<lb/>
siderable fascination with the story of the Nicholsons' transformation of a derelict Tudor manor with its half-ruined cottages and forlorn agricultural land-<lb/>
scape into a private dream world and refuge. It is the story of two survivors of a vanished culture of landed aristocracy, latter-day nobility whose thoughts were deeply imbued with English history. Their salvaging of a remnant of this heritage during the Great Depres-<lb/>
sion and World War II constitutes a remarkable achievement in the realm of preservation.</p>

<p>In <hi rend="italic">The Land,</hi> a long pastoral poem that owes a debt to Virgil's <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> and <name type="pname">Thomson</name>'s <hi rend="italic">The Seasons,</hi> Sackville-West created a portrait of the not-quite-van-<lb/>
ished tradition of agrarian life of the south of <name type="place">England</name>. Through her garden, she preserved and embellished this mellow English scene. She was acquainted with both Jekyll and Robinson, and her inspired planting schemes can be traced to their influence. On the first of two visits to <name type="place">Persia</name>, where <name type="pname">Harold Nicholson</name> was posted in <date when="1926">1926</date> and <date when="1927">1927</date>, she appreciated in the gar-<lb/>
dens of Isfahan the vital role of water and saw how the Islamic garden's fourfold geometric order could encompass and enhance the lushness of the vegeta-<lb/>
tion. Her firsthand experience of Persian gardens was, according to her biographer, Jane Brown, "the bacca-<lb/>
laureate of Vita the gardener."<ref target="#CH11-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Harold Nicholson deemed himself a classicist, and although his cast of mind was not as fervently romantic as his wife's, he may have yearned as deeply as she did for an older, preurban <name type="place">England</name>. In his subtle discrimination between these two modes of thought, there was room for reconciliation: "It would seem indeed as if the misunderstanding that arises between the romantic and the classical temperament is due, not so much to any conflict between the imagination and reason, as to the fact that whereas the classic finds pleasure in recognition, the romantic derives his own greatest stimulus from surprise."<ref target="#CH11-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref>The tension between the opposing but complementary poles of classicism and romanticism is a major factor in Sis-singhurst's success as a work of landscape design.</p>
<p>Nicholson faced considerable difficulty in developing axes and classical geometries within the old manor's footprint. The spaces formed by old walls and structures, including a moat, contained many obtuse angles. In compromising his penchant for the classical in order to harmonize an abstract ideal with the reality of the ground, Nicholson arrived at some-<lb/>
thing more akin to the plan of Hadrian's Villa, with its independent, impinging axes, than that of an Italianate or Beaux-Arts-style garden where axial coherence and geometric regularity predominate (see fig. 2.43).</p>

<p>Within its separate parts, however, he paid close atten-<lb/>
tion to sight lines, scale, and proportion. The garden beds within these spaces constituted the loom upon which Vita Sackville-West wove a brocade of floral pic-<lb/>
tures in subtle textures and sophisticated color harmo-<lb/>
nies. Her most celebrated inspiration was the creation of the White Garden, where white flowers and silvery leaves catch the lingering daylight and shine forth in moonlight (fig. 11.28).</p>
<p>The garden as private Elysium, a refuge from twentieth-century civilization and its discontents, has contin-<lb/>
ued to offer emotional satisfaction to those who can afford a country retreat. Borrowing from the fused tra-<lb/>
dition of Jekyll, Peto, and their contemporaries, British gardeners such as Penelope Hobhouse and Rosemary Veery perpetuate the Arts and Crafts <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> Neoclassical heritage in garden design. Theirs is a preservationist style that evokes a bygone <name type="place">England</name> of old manor houses, embowered cottages, and the long dream of <name type="place">Italy</name>. At the same time, practitioners in this vein are extremely sophisticated, combining in original and often stunning ways newer hybrids with simple native varieties and plants with venerable horticultural histories, such as old-fashioned roses. In spite of this stylistic continuity lasting to the present day, Sissinghurst, created on the eve of World War II, symbolizes the end of an era. The postwar social agenda in <name type="place">England</name> and the rest of Europe, as well as the high taxes that support it, made the lavish private gardens built by the Edwardians and their Vic-<lb/>
torian predecessors impossible to sustain. Generally speaking, the same thing was true in the United States.</p>

<p>The accumulated fortunes of the Gilded Age passed down to the high-living generation that, bask-<lb/>

Although concessions to climate, topography, and native scenery continued to be relevant concerns, the emulation of European examples and the perfection of European styles became for a time more important than the search for an original American landscape design idiom.</p>
<p>As we have seen, artistically inclined people and writers such as Henry James and Edith Wharton, with sufficient leisure and income to make regular exten-<lb/>

scapes, including several of the ones described in Wharton's <hi rend="italic">Italian Villas and Their Gardens,</hi> she enrolled in Professor William Ware's course at Columbia University's School of Mines in order to learn drafting to scale, elevation rendering, and such aspects of surveying and engineering as she would need to grade slopes, lay drives, and provide proper drainage systems for designed landscapes. Equipped with these technical skills and her notes, photographs, and the prints of European gardens she had collected, the twenty-five-year-old, self-taught landscape archi-<lb/>
tect was ready to begin professional practice.</p>
<p>Her first clients, whom she served from the office she established on an upper floor of her moth-<lb/>
er's brownstone home on east Eleventh Street in <name type="place">New York</name>, included several fellow Bar Harbor summer residents; Pierre Lorillard, for whom she prepared a planting plan for the area around the entrance lodges of his suburban development, Tuxedo Park, <name type="place">New York</name>; <name type="pname">William R. Garrison</name>, a leading resident of Tux-<lb/>
edo Park, for whom she designed a garden; Clement B. Newbold, owner of Crosswicks in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania; and Anson Phelps Stokes, the propri-<lb/>

necticut. Her mother and aunt, both socially well-connected, facilitated introductions and made her feel at ease with such powerful men as J. P. Mor-<lb/>

Her avuncular friend Henry James, who resided in <name type="place">England</name>, helped her meet the coterie of gardeners in the Cotswolds. The founding of the Garden Club of <name type="place">America</name> in <date when="1913">1913</date> offered her another network at home.</p>
<p>Throughout her long career, Reef Point remained Farrand's laboratory for plant experimentation. Peri-<lb/>

age partially screen the lawn sweeping up to the front of the house, ensuring a degree of privacy. A large orangery off the east wing provides an effective transition between the house and the first of a series of outdoor rooms, the Beech Terrace, named for its central feature, a massive purple beech tree. As one descends to the Urn Terrace and, below it, to the <name type="pname">Rose Terrace</name>, then drops yet another level to the Fountain Terrace, one appreciates Farrand's eye for proportion, line, and detail (figs. 11.30,11.31,11.32). Her artistry appears in the scale of stairs and their finial and urn-punctuated piers, the deft interplay between straight and curving elements, and the contrasting textures of the carefully articulated ground plane with its finely crafted paving materials, grass, and planting beds (fig. 11.33). Below the Fountain Terrace, hidden from view, is one of Farrand's most charming conceits, a small outdoor amphitheater and Lover's Lane Pool.</hi></q>

Here her skill in orchestrating gar-<lb/>

designer of rock gardens, using indigenous plant material, and her mature work was marked by an intelligent search for an American garden design idiom. In this, she translated the inspiration she derived from Italian, Chinese, and other landscape traditions into an elegant and original style, which is exemplified in her two finest surviving gardens. Dumbarton Oaks in <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, the estate of Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss, her masterpiece, demonstrates her confident originality in synthesizing the Arts and Crafts and Italianate landscape idioms of her time (figs. 11.29&#x2013;11.34).</p>
<p>The Eyrie Garden, designed for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, at Seal Harbor, Maine, has a large rect-<lb/>
angular sunken garden, the walls of which are topped with imported Chinese tiles. This garden is entered on the north through a moon gate modeled on one Mrs. Rockefeller had admired in Beijing (fig. 11.35). Inside, Farrand planted annuals to maximize floral display during the short Maine summer, and sur-<lb/>
rounding the garden on the outside she created beds of perennials in a palette composed predominantly of lavender, blue, and white.</p>
<p>For Abby Rockefeller's husband, <name type="pname">John D. Rockefeller</name>, Jr., Farrand became a valued pro bono consultant on the planting plans for the carriage roads that Rockefeller conceived and funded at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine. Here, near her own summer home, at the dawn of the age of the automobile, she applied the principles learned from Olmsted's design of the drives at Biltmore and the Arnold Arboretum to enhance with native mate-<lb/>
rial&#x2014;spruce, pitch pine, sweet fern, wild roses, sumac, goldenrod, and bush blueberry&#x2014;Rockefel-<lb/>
ler's vision of scenic revelation through an artful arrangement of the motorist's serial vantage points.</p>

<p>Although women practitioners did not yet receive commissions for parks or other public works, landscape design was one of a limited number of pro-<lb/>
fessions open to them at the beginning of the twenti-<lb/>
eth century. The founding of the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture for Women in <date when="1901">1901</date> in Gro-<lb/>
ton, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, the Pennsylvania School of Hor-<lb/>
ticulture for Women in <date when="1910">1910</date>, and the <name type="place">Cambridge</name> School of Landscape Architecture for Women in <date when="1916">1916</date> helped open a career path to women wishing to enter the field. Like Beatrice Farrand, Ellen Biddle Ship-<lb/>
man (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1950">1950</date>), who received her training in the office of Charles Platt, ran an all-woman landscape architectural firm. As in the case of Farrand, Ship-<lb/>
man's entry into the field was facilitated by her horti-<lb/>
cultural knowledge and an ability to provide planting plans for Platt and other landscape designers such as Warren Manning. Because she did not travel to Europe until <date when="1929">1929</date>, when she was sixty years old, her independent work was less influenced by foreign examples than that of Farrand or the <name type="place">Rome</name> prizewin-<lb/>
ners, who were her contemporaries. It can best be characterized as an application of Jekyll's lessons to a traditional Colonial-revival style&#x2014;a marriage of Arts and Crafts planting principles with the geometrical layout of old-fashioned American gardens&#x2014;or, put another way, a translation of formal design into a more relaxed, domestic vernacular. It was a style that was both sophisticated and unpretentious.</p>
<p>Shipman and her husband, Louis, were part of the artists' colony in Cornish, New Hampshire, which included <name type="pname">Charles Platt</name>. Although she had learned basic drafting skills in Platt's office, she lacked Far-<lb/>
rand's rigorous professional training, including the requisite engineering skills to develop extensive grad-<lb/>
ing and drainage plans. Neverthe-<lb/>
less, in <date when="1920">1920</date>, she opened an office in <name type="place">New York</name> City. Because her work was almost exclusively residential, she did not seek membership in the recently formed, male-dominated American Society of Landscape Architects. Nevertheless, she found a substantial niche within the profes-<lb/>
sion. The young Garden Club of America&#x2014;a national organization supporting the work of many local gar-<lb/>
den clubs throughout the country&#x2014;had stimulated an interest in horticulture among affluent women. They provided Shipman with a natural client base and net-<lb/>
work of referrals for commissions&#x2014;more than six hundred during her years of professional practice. Many of her jobs were undertaken in collaboration with other landscape architects, including Charles Platt, Warren Manning, and Fletcher Steele.</p>
<p>Able landscape photographers such as Mattie Edwards Hewitt recorded the appearance of many of Shipman's gardens (fig. 11.36). Publication of photo-<lb/>
graphs of Shipman gardens in contemporary periodi-<lb/>
cals&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">The Garden, House and Garden,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">House Beautiful</hi>&#x2014;together with her skills as a public lec-<lb/>
turer and her congenial personality, contributed to her success. Her clients tended to favor an atmosphere of
<pb n="397"/>
<pb n="397" type="orig"/>
idyllic seclusion and well-guarded privacy. As a rule, Shipman screened the borders of her gardens with heavy plantings. Her "secret" gardens were spaces for dreamy contemplation as well as for inti-<lb/>
created a conservative reaction mate socializing with family and friends. Small-<lb/>
scale works of sculpture inject notes of fancy and function as pleasing garden decor. Their meaning is secondary, for by the twentieth century mythology no longer had allegorical significance for designer or client but served as a branch of storytelling, pro-<lb/>
viding a genteel foretaste of the role of fantasy in the thematic landscapes of the present day.</p>
<p>Shipman's planting schemes were typically accompanied by detailed horticultural instructions intended to ensure proper maintenance by clients and their gardeners. In addition, she made regular visits to estates where her designs were installed, and some clients put her in charge of administering annual discretionary funds for plant purchases. Her practice was far-flung, and she spent a great deal of time traveling by train and later by plane to job sites all over the United States. The Sarah P. Duke Memo-<lb/>
rial Gardens at Duke University in North Carolina was one of her most significant designs. Because she socialized with her clients, who introduced her to their friends, many of whom also hired her, she had clusters of commissions in such places as <name type="place">Cleveland</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>; Grosse Point, Michigan; the North Shore of Long Island; and Mount Kisco, <name type="place">New York</name>. In these pockets of affluence, until the exigencies of World War II brought commissions to a virtual halt, Ship-<lb/>
man designed idyllic gardens, historically inflected refuges from the modern industrial scene&#x2014;ironi-<lb/>
cally, the source of wealth that enabled many of the gardens to exist in the first place.</p>

<p><name type="place">California</name> proved an ideal place for experimentation and the transformation of older forms of landscape design into a distinctive, if eclectic, regional style. Because the state enjoys some spectacular hilly and mountainous scenery and has along its coast what is known as a Mediterranean climate, it was especially congenial to the creation of Italianate and Span-<lb/>
ish-style gardens. Although the Anglo-American railroad barons and other capitalists who first settled the state created gardens within the prevailing nine-<lb/>
teenth-century Picturesque tradition, they soon began to capture the opportunities inherent in the mild climate, which, combined with irrigation tech-<lb/>
nology, permitted the introduction of species of eucalyptus and other semitropical plants from <name type="place">Aus-<lb/>
tralia</name> and South Africa. Nurserymen in <name type="place">San Fran-<lb/>

There, Henry Huntington's head gardener, William Hertrich, installed a number of botanical collections through massive transplanting and propagation in the estate's nurseries (fig. 11.37).</p>

<p>The climate of <name type="place">California</name> encouraged the design of outdoor living spaces and a greater stylis-<lb/>

tic informality than elsewhere. Remoteness and a frontier spirit also served to foster a lifestyle less cir-<lb/>
cumscribed by social convention than that of the East-<lb/>
ern seaboard. Helen Hunt Jackson's popular novel <hi rend="italic">Ramona</hi> (<date when="1884">1884</date>), written to call attention to federal policy injustices toward Native Americans and His-<lb/>
panics, drew a romantic portrait of <name type="place">California</name>'s pre-Anglo way of life with its Franciscan missions and Spanish haciendas. This stimulated some highly imaginative reconstructions of actual missions and their gardens and gave birth to the Mission Revival style and other design interpretations of a mythical regional past, notably the somewhat later Spanish Colonial style. In this attempt to forge a regional iden-<lb/>
tity and to project an architecture compatible with the newly enriched vegetal repertory, designers appropri-<lb/>
ated various Mediterranean styles, with principal emphasis on that of Andalusian Spain. In urban design terms, this is best seen in Santa Barbara where, after the earthquake of <date when="1925">1925</date>, the city set about rebuilding itself almost entirely in terms of a remarkably inven-<lb/>
tive pseudo-Spanish style, best illustrated by its grandly scaled centerpiece, architect William Moos-<lb/>

<p>Farther north, in the Bay area, to harmonize with the surrounding scenery, Bernard Maybeck (<date when="1862">1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>) created a landscape idiom of mixed native and exotic vegetation, uncut local stone, and rough-<lb/>
dressed rockwork for the residential developments undertaken by the Hillside Club, an improvement society in <name type="place">Berkeley</name>. In the first decade of the twentieth century, Japanese influence combined with that of the prevailing Arts and Crafts movement to produce the sensitive siting, fine hand detailing, and imaginative use of natural materials by Charles Sumner Greene (<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>) and <name type="pname">Henry Mather Greene</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1954">1954</date>), architects in Pasadena. In <date when="1921">1921</date>, Charles Greene demonstrated in the <name type="pname">David L. James</name> house in the Car-<lb/>
mel Highlands his complete mastery of an original design vocabulary in which local rock walls, the result of meticulous, painstaking craftsmanship, appear to emerge organically from the geological structure of the hillside. In <date when="1911">1911</date> and <date when="1926">1926</date>&#x2013;28, he performed an equal but different tour de force at Green Gables, the Mortimer and Bella Fleishacker estate overlooking the Santa Cruz Mountains in Woodside. In the monu-<lb/>
mental staircase and arcade of the beautiful water gar-<lb/>
den, Greene executed his Beaux-Arts design in a rustic, regional manner using uncut native stones (fig. 11.38).</p>
<p>Not all wealthy Californians pursued the path of stylistic experimentation opened up by these original designers. One of the most renowned of the remaining gardens from this period is Filoli, nestled into the exceptionally scenic landscape of Woodside, 30 miles south of <name type="place">San Fran-<lb/>
cisco</name>. The Georgian-style house, designed by <name type="pname">Willis Polk</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924">1924</date>) of <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, was built between <date when="1916">1916</date> and <date when="1919">1919</date> for William Bowers Bourn II, owner of a hard-rock gold mine and a local water company, after Bourn purchased his 654-<lb/>
acre estate. Bourn's friend and hunting companion Bruce Porter (<date when="1865">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1955">1955</date>), a poet, painter, and artist in stained glass as well as a landscape designer, was responsible for the layout of the garden, and Isabella Worn, a <name type="place">San Francisco</name> floral designer, for the planting plans. Her work continued after new owners pur-<lb/>
chased the property in <date when="1936">1936</date>. Neither Porter nor Worn had a talent approaching Farrand's, but, aided by the spectacular site, excellent climate, and good current management by the Filoli Center, their work resulted in a garden of considerable charm (fig. 11.39).</p>
<p>Sometimes the <name type="place">California</name> Mediterranean expres-<lb/>
sion was carried to theatrical heights, as at San Sim-<lb/>
eon, the estate of William Randolph Hearst. An amalgam of stage-set effects, San Simeon evokes
<pb n="399"/>
<pb n="399" type="orig"/>
styles as diverse as those of ancient <name type="place">Egypt</name> and con-<lb/>
temporary Art Moderne. <name type="pname">Julia Morgan</name> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>), the first woman to be enrolled in the architecture pro-<lb/>
gram of the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts and the first to obtain a license from the State of <name type="place">California</name> to practice architecture, designed the palatial house and exotic guest houses. Charles Gibbs Adams was the landscape architect who responded to Hearst's grandiose ideas as the gardens took shape around the vast collections of exotic animals, specimen trees, sculpture, and dec-<lb/>
orative artifacts that Hearst amassed at this private fantasy weekend "resort."</p>
<p>Although eastern architects such as Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924">1924</date>) joined the handful of resident professionals who received commissions to design houses and gardens on <name type="place">California</name> estates in the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, amateurs and nurserymen were responsible for laying out some of the most notable ones. Good-<lb/>
hue was the architect in charge of the <date when="1915">1915</date> Pana-<lb/>
ma-<name type="place">California</name> Exposition held in San Diego. In opposition to Irving Gill and others who saw this as an opportunity to forge a simpler, more modern regional idiom, Goodhue deemed a neo-traditional Spanish Colonial Baroque style to be the most desir-<lb/>
able one for the fair's buildings. The landscape design-<lb/>
ers matched its architectural flamboyance with a riot of lush semitropical vegetation arranged in extrava-<lb/>
gant floral displays. The fair gave license to an unbri-<lb/>
dled eclecticism, and the opulent tone it set was highly influential. Not only did various forms of Spanish and Mexican architecture become popular, but direct imi-<lb/>
tation of Italian villa architecture and gardens was widely practiced.</p>
<p>A nurseryman, <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name>, was inspired by the fair to seek his living as a designer of great estates. With entrepreneurial energy and a flair for salesman-<lb/>
ship, Hanson became a landscape contractor, hiring the design and horticultural talent he needed to fulfill his commissions. In his breezy memoir, he tells how he succeeded in getting the job to design Greenacres, movie millionaire Harold Lloyd's 16-acre estate in Beverly Hills. Working with golf course designer Billy Bell and architect Sumner Spaulding, he created between <date when="1925">1925</date> and <date when="1929">1929</date> a grandiose scheme that included a 100-foot (30.5-meter) waterfall spilling into a canoe course that also served as a water hazard for the golf course, a fairy-tale English village play yard with a thatched roof cottage and pony stable for Lloyd's three-year-old daughter, a "Villa Lante" cas-<lb/>
cade, a "Villa Medici" fountain, and a "Villa d'Este" pool. The house was modeled on the Villa Gamberaia (fig. 11.40).</p>

Casa del Her-<lb/>

vens and then with Lockwood deForest (<date when="1896">1896</date>&#x2013;<date when="1949">1949</date>) to create by <date when="1933">1933</date> a series of axially related garden spaces with tiled water channels and low, Span-<lb/>

<p>Not only did some of the estates of southern <name type="place">Cal-<lb/>

Yoch was hired to create gardens for such Hollywood executives as director George Cukor and producer <name type="pname">Jack Warner</name>. She was given a budget of $100,000, a lavish sum at the time, for landscaping Warner's 18-acre Southern-plantation-style estate, located near Harold Lloyd's and those of several other famous movie stars in Beverly Hills' Benedict Canyon. But, like Hanson, Yoch found in Montecito the conditions that inspired what is perhaps her finest creation, Il Brolino, the fey topiary garden she designed on the 7-acre estate of lumber heiress Mary Stewart to complement George <name type="place">Washington</name> Smith's handsome Italian-villa-style house (fig. 11.42). Here one sees the flexibility of her imagi-<lb/>
nation in the way she softened the garden's geometrical lines with the fat, rounded, whimsical forms of animals and playing-card symbols in clipped boxwood, artfully juxtaposed against the background trees and mountains beyond. This quality is also apparent in her habit of modifying symmetry with adjustments to site condi-<lb/>
tions and the occasional eccentric placement of a tree or other object within an otherwise formal space.</p>

dens of the Gilded Age is Vizcaya, built between <date when="1912">1912</date> and <date when="1916">1916</date> on Biscayne Bay in <name type="place">Florida</name> by James Deer-<lb/>
ing, heir of the harvesting machinery manufacturer. F. Burrall Hoffman, Jr., designed the house as a boldly eclectic pastiche, with each facade portraying a differ-<lb/>
ent era of Italian villa architecture. Hoffman's artisti-<lb/>
cally inclined friend, Paul Chalfin, helped him garner the tapestries and furniture to create the grand decora-<lb/>
tive effects that lend the interior its air of opulence. Diego Suarez, a Colombian who was tutored in land-<lb/>
scape design at La Pietra by Arthur Acton, created the elaborate gardens, which combine echoes of Spain, <name type="place">France</name>, and <name type="place">Venice</name>, and serve as a reminder of Isola Bella, the Borromeo family villa whose terraces rise like the decks of a galleon from the waters of Lake Maggiore (fig. 11.43; see figs. 5.40&#x2013;5.41).</p>
<p>Vizcaya was a bellwether, stimulating rich East-<lb/>
erners and eventually the European Riviera set to come to <name type="place">Florida</name>. Promoted by the entrepreneur Henry Flagler, Palm Beach became a fashionable resort in large measure due to Addison Mizner (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1933">1933</date>). Mizner was a society architect practicing first in Phil-<lb/>
<pb n="401"/>
<pb n="401" type="orig"/>
adelphia and then in <name type="place">New York</name>. His career was given a tremendous boost after <date when="1918">1918</date> when he dis-<lb/>
covered Palm Beach and its potential as an Amer-<lb/>
ican Riviera. With some of the same eclectic imagination and flair for client relations as <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name>, Mizner, who was widely traveled and a collector of antiques and architectural artifacts from all over the world, invented virtually sin-<lb/>
gle-handedly the Palm Beach style, a pseudo-His-<lb/>
panic amalgam of dramatic decorative effects. Mizner took complete charge of his clients' proj-<lb/>
ects, serving as architect, interior decorator, and landscape designer.</p>
<p>Though physically distant, as resort commu-<lb/>
nities with a similar ethos of self-invented domes-<lb/>
tic and urbanistic stagecraft and a common Hispanic-Italianate-Mediterranean appearance, Santa Barbara and Palm Beach were close cousins. Mizner, in fact, took the skills he perfected in <name type="place">Flor-<lb/>
ida</name> to <name type="pname">Parklane</name>, an estate in Santa Barbara where he combined Venetian Gothic elements with images derived from the Villa Lante. Thus did wealthy Americans of this period commission designers to take recipes from the European ban-<lb/>
quet and concoct architectural menus of cribbed grandeur intended to surpass the original models. Sometimes blatantly, as in the gardens of <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name> and elsewhere more subtly, as in the gar-<lb/>
dens of Platt, Farrand, and Shipman, we find evi-<lb/>
dence of the transformation of garden art into garden style.</p>
<p>Resort communities such as <name type="pname">Santa Barbara</name> and Palm Beach are phenomena of machine-age technology&#x2014;beautiful and remote places made accessible by private railroad car (later by private jet). The cost of transportation for their temporary residents, among other factors, ensured their status as exclusive enclaves, especially in their early years. Commercial rail and aviation and, more sig-<lb/>
nificant, mass production of the twentieth-century machine par excellence, the private automobile, has democratized the landscape, making many beauti-<lb/>
ful places accessible to the masses. The implica-<lb/>
tions of these technological developments for city planners and landscape designers is a major theme in the subsequent chapters of this book.</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-498">

</figure>
<p>By <date when="1900">1900</date>, industrial power had vastly multiplied the products of human manufacture and consumption and greatly increased the speed with which goods and people were transported to both near and distant parts. Consequent social transformations accelerated the uprooting of age-old agrarian traditions, emptying villages of their young people and causing the continued exponential growth of cities beyond all previous conceptions of normative urban size. In spite of these dislocations and changes, a widely shared opti-<lb/>
mism and a broad belief in the possibilities for universal progress in the material conditions of human life prevailed. Many people had begun to fully comprehend the capability of Machine Age means of production to radically expand economies as industrial capitalism opened new markets for a growing abundance of low-<lb/>
cost goods. The ease of production had the obvious potential of raising the living standards of a broad spectrum of humanity, mak-<lb/>
ing the producers of wealth consumers as well. The rapid advances in industrial technology that added to individual well-being and made the domestic realm more comfortable also made possible the great public works projects that are the signal manifestations of the modern industrial city. Indeed, modern urbanism and industrial capitalism are inextricably allied, as we saw in our discussion of Haussmann's transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name> between <date when="1850">1850</date> and <date when="1870">1870</date>.</p>
<p>A growing democratic spirit and the moral purpose this implied inspired many visionary attempts to redress inequalities within exist-<lb/>
ing and developing capitalist societies. Reformers wished to remedy the ills of poverty and plan optimal environments for all classes of humanity. Romanticism and its concomitant impulse toward revo-<lb/>
lution had already laid the cultural groundwork for respect of individual rights. Enlightenment rationalism&#x2014;now a broadly shared attitude toward scientific inquiry and technical problem solving&#x2014; assumed that reason could readily dictate remedies for the wants and injustices that had heretofore been the lot of humankind.</p>
<p>Although proponents of bourgeois capitalist culture&#x2014;the economic engine that propelled the Industrial Revolution&#x2014;refuted the theories of Karl Marx (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883">1883</date>), they were none-<lb/>
theless seminal to the ethos of modern Western society. Marx proclaimed that the aspirations of civilization cloaked a class strug-<lb/>
gle for material power. He saw how industrialization had attracted workers from the land, forcing them into slums within hugely dis-<lb/>
tended metropolitan areas. He conceived socialist communism as a comprehensive political system to replace capitalism and redis-<lb/>
tribute wealth so that working-class people would enjoy the fruits of their labor. Although he had nothing to say about urban plan-<lb/>
ning, the movement to improve urban living conditions gained momentum through Marx's critique, and a spirit of Marxist progressive reform prevailed even among those who did not seek to radically alter the premises of capitalist societies and their govern-<lb/>
ments.</p>
<p>The American economist Henry George (<date when="1839">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897">1897</date>) had argued in <hi rend="italic">Progress and Poverty</hi> (<date when="1879">1879</date>) that the abolition of other taxes in favor of a single tax on the appreciation in value of unim-<lb/>
proved real estate would transfer this unearned wealth to the gov-<lb/>
ernment for redistribution in the form of public works. Although not supported by many political leaders or economists, George exerted a strong influence among reformers in Britain and <name type="place">Amer-<lb/>
ica</name>, among whom Ebenezer Howard, father of the Garden City movement, figured prominently. Another American, Thorstein Veblen (<date when="1857">1857</date>- <date when="1929">1929</date>), a radical economist, teacher, and author, examined economic history through an evolutionary lens in his trenchant critique, <hi rend="italic">The Theory of the Leisure Class</hi> (<date when="1899">1899</date>). He coined the term "conspicuous consumption" to describe manifes-<lb/>
tations of nonproductive leisure as a means of displaying wealth. The individual breadwinner with a nonworking wife was the most obvious example of what Veblen meant by conspicuous consump-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>These arguments those put forth by Peter Kropotkin (<date when="1842">1842</date>&#x2014; <date when="1921">1921</date>), a Russian nobleman who advocated a protocommunist phi-<lb/>
losophy of social cooperation, and by British playwright George
<pb n="403"/>
<pb n="403" type="orig"/>
<name type="pname">Bernard Shaw</name> (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1950">1950</date>) and his fellow members of the Fabian Society,<ref target="#CH12-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>an organization promoting evolutionary socialism, pro-<lb/>
vided the fertile ground that nurtured utopian visions as social thinkers focused their attention upon the problems of the recently formed mass society living in big cities. Middle-class mores still confined women's roles to the domestic sphere, although rates of labor-force participation for women grew steadily throughout the twentieth century. Of great importance in terms of urbanism, many women were active as professional volunteers in the reforms of the Progressive Era&#x2014;the period beginning in the early part of the twentieth century in which a number of social improvements in the areas of housing, education, parks, social welfare, and civil service were initiated. Jane Addams (<date when="1860">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935">1935</date>), social worker, founder of the Hull House&#x2014;the model for other settlement houses in America&#x2014;feminist, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in <date when="1931">1931</date>, was perhaps the most notable among the numerous dedicated women reformers ministering to the urban masses.</p>
<p>As advocates of the potential benefits of technology and engi-<lb/>
neering&#x2014;provided these were applied to a broad social agenda rather than merely to amassing spectacular profits for capitalists&#x2014; Progressive Era social reformers did not recoil from the Machine Age. They viewed it hopefully as the long-awaited instrument of relief from human misery. They were confident that the forces of industrial progress, when applied rationally to the problems of urban development, could improve the human condition by offering wholesome housing alternatives to the immigrant hordes in crowded slums and by providing the swelling ranks of urban dwellers with ready contact with nature. Although private capital was essential, they saw municipal and state governments or special-purpose pub-<lb/>
lic corporations as the logical sponsors of large-scale, urban projects because these legally chartered bodies had the power necessary to assemble large parcels of land and undertake the construction of roads, rail lines, and utilities. Thus, their social agenda went hand in hand with enlargement of the responsibilities of government and the establishment of quasi-governmental authorities.</p>
<p>Transportation technologies have been hugely influential in fostering the process of metropolitan growth, which has often been guided by the agendas of corporations as much as by regional plan-<lb/>
ners. Although railroads greatly altered cities, making possible the growth of suburbs and interurban transportation networks, the automobile has had even greater consequences, especially in the United States. Of particular significance to the subject of landscape design, automobile mass production after <date when="1913">1913</date> led to the multipli-<lb/>
cation of nonurban recreational parks and the creation of exurban automobile parkways of a different scale and design configuration than the intra-urban boulevardlike ones planned in an era of car-<lb/>
riage transportation. In addition to opening the countryside to vaca-<lb/>
tioners, the automobile expanded urban form beyond its previous enlargement by rail lines. The driver's ability to steer the car along routes of individual choice stimulated the infilling of open lands between previously established corridors of rail-related metropol-<lb/>
itan settlement with new roadways and networks of local streets. With the spread of suburbs, which were no longer tethered to rail lines, the urban fabric was loosened to the point where, at least in the land-rich United States, freestanding dwellings surrounded by lawns became the norm, particularly after New Deal govern-<lb/>
ment-sponsored home mortgage programs and post&#x2014;World War II mortgage loans for veterans stimulated mass-produced tract hou-<lb/>
sing. Cities as visibly discrete entities ceased to exist, becoming instead conurbations, or Standard Metropolitan Areas as census statisticians now refer to them.</p>
<p>Haussmann and Olmsted had demonstrated ways to concep-<lb/>
tualize the city in technical and recreational terms. Now, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a second generation of urban planners applied this process to a more-than-metropolitan scale that encompassed the surrounding region. These planners went beyond the notion of greening the urban mass with landscaped squares and parks connected by intra-urban parkways. They envisioned the dis-<lb/>
persal of industry and populations into the countryside, where liv-<lb/>
ing conditions could be made more humane and healthy than in the increasingly congested cities. Conceptual planning such as this was a first step toward zoning regulations and governmental policies affecting both public and private development.</p>
<p>While demonstrating an expanding social consciousness among industrial nations and the necessity to consider the needs of large, heterogeneous populations, the schemes presented by ear-<lb/>
ly-twentieth-century planners demonstrate significant differences in approach. On the one hand were the committed modernists, notably the architects Otto Wagner, Tony Garnier, and Le Corbus-<lb/>
ier, who approached the urban future with wholehearted optimism, untroubled by the transformation of the city's appearance into an expression of functional, machinelike order and practicality. On the other, there were urban theoreticians such as Ebenezer Howard and his disciples who tried to preserve some imagery from the prein-<lb/>
dustrial past. Thus, they retained picturesqueness in the form of individuated architectural elements and spatial configurations while fully embracing new engineering and industrial processes. They took as their mandate John Ruskin's words calling for "no festering and wretched suburb anywhere, but clean and busy street within, and open country without, with a [surrounding] belt of beautiful garden and orchard, so that from any part of the city per-<lb/>
fectly fresh air and grass and sight of far horizon might be reachable in a few minutes' walk."<ref target="#CH12-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The nostalgic impulses of Camillo Sitte and his followers, which we examined in Chapter Eleven, tempered some of moder-<lb/>
nity's zeal, giving birth to preservationism and the protection not only of monuments, but also of historic building ensembles and street patterns. But even the most committed preservationists of craft traditions and earlier design styles did not want to be deprived of such mechanical conveniences as central heating and indoor plumbing. Both progressive and historicist social utopians hoped that machine technology could help build a better world. This ambivalence about modernity and the desire to have both the fruits of technology and a sense of connection with the historical past continue to be reflected in the contemporary landscape, a subject we will consider in Chapter Fifteen. Here our task is to discuss the proposals and projects of the optimistic theorists and planners who sought to guide urbanism in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">I. Urban Expansion: Town Planning for the Machine Age in Britain and Continental Europe</hi></hi></head>
<p>With the rise of industrialization in the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury, some humanitarian capitalists built factories and workers' housing in new towns&#x2014;model communities in the countryside outside large cities&#x2014;thereby substi-<lb/>
tuting sunlight, clean air, and greenery for the sooty congestion of the urban slum. These early planned communities with their individual houses, gardens, central parks, and local schools, all carefully separated from the industrial districts that were their raison d'&#x00EA;tre, provide a preview of later zoning practices. What is most apparent about several of these planned communities is the premium put on openness. The father of the garden city movement, <name type="pname">Ebenezer Howard</name> (<date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1928">1928</date>), followed these forceful opponents of metropolitan gigantism, turning their impulse toward reform into an influential philosophy of decentralized planning. Regionalism became a new framework within which rural and urban space could be organized so as to create greenbelt-encircled new towns, thus pro-<lb/>
viding the advantages of both the city and the country-<lb/>
side. The city as an expanding and loosening, but still discrete, entity would, if developed as Howard pre-<lb/>
scribed, henceforth become no longer a solid urban mass, but rather a constellation of population clusters.</p>

<p>While furthering the agenda of proletarian egalitarian-<lb/>
ism and denouncing the noisome squalor of the indus-<lb/>
trial city, Marx and his socialist collaborator <name type="pname">Friedrich Engels</name> (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">1895</date>) paid no attention to urban form, believing that revolution must sweep away the old order before their utopian goals could be achieved. Without governmental means to foster the develop-<lb/>
ment of new towns, factory owners initially undertook to reform the living conditions of the industrial work-<lb/>
force. The light from Ruskin's <hi rend="italic">Seven Lamps</hi> illumined the path of many of these Victorian reformers, and their idealism reflected the influence of William Morris as they attempted to ameliorate and beautify the Industrial Age city through the application of an Arts and Crafts aesthetic rooted in the tradition of medieval artisans' guilds. Like Sitte, they focused on preserving past forms, and like him they codified what had been the organic growth patterns of an earlier time, thus creating a modern version of the Picturesque.</p>
<p>In <date when="1853">1853</date>, <name type="pname">Sir Titus Salt</name> (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), a textile manufacturer, built Saltaire on the banks of the river Aire outside the city of Bradford in the Midlands of <name type="place">England</name>. About a quarter of a century later, George and Richard Cadbury, owners of Cadbury Brothers, manu-<lb/>
facturers of chocolate, created Bournville, a workers' community, in conjunction with the construction of new plant facilities near Birmingham. The Cadburys designed Bournville as a town of spacious greenery; they gave all of its 313 cottages gardens and allocated a generous portion of the 330-acre site to parkland. Curving streets and variously styled houses contributed picturesqueness. Nonemployees were allowed to take up residence in Bournville, and in <date when="1900">1900</date> George Cad-<lb/>
bury established the Bournville Village Trust, which subsequently turned the revenues from the coopera-<lb/>
tively administered estate into further improvements, resulting in the addition of schools, churches, shops, and other amenities.</p>
<p>In <date when="1888">1888</date>, another philanthropically inclined indus-<lb/>
trialist, <name type="pname">William Hesketh Lever</name> (<date when="1851">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1925">1925</date>), founded Port Sunlight near Liverpool as a company town for the employees of Lever Brothers, manufacturers of soap (fig. 12.1). Lever's humanitarian impulse to improve the living conditions of his industrial work-<lb/>
force and to bestow upon it the amenities of the coun-<lb/>
tryside resulted in tree-lined streets, a network of pedestrian paths, allotment gardens, a central park and sports fields, and community buildings and houses designed in the English vernacular style of older coun-<lb/>
try villages. Sunlight and fresh air were obvious anti-<lb/>
dotes to the grimy, tubercular conditions of the great coal-burning cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and <name type="place">London</name>.</p>
<p>Turning the palliatives of philanthropic industri-<lb/>
alists into a more general and broad-scale prescription, the English reformer Ebenezer Howard promoted a vision of population dispersal into a series of planned communities in his influential book <hi rend="italic">To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Social Reform</hi> (<date when="1898">1898</date>), republished as <hi rend="italic">Garden Cities of To-morrow</hi> (<date when="1902">1902</date>). Considered the
<pb n="405"/>
<pb n="405" type="orig"/>
father of the garden city movement, Howard saw how, thanks to the proliferating network of rail-<lb/>
roads, it was possible to leap over the city's no-lon-<lb/>
ger-fixed boundaries and systematically create within the larger regional framework communities that combined the natural advantages of the country with the amenities of urban life.<ref target="#CH12-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>As a young man Howard earned his living as a stenographer in <name type="place">Chicago</name>, which then enjoyed the Latin epithet <hi rend="italic">Urbs in Hortus</hi> (the City in a Garden). He was probably familiar with Riverside, the gar-<lb/>
den suburb designed by Olmsted and Vaux. This hugely influential British social thinker went to great pains to prove that within the current capitalist system both social benefit and sound economic return could be gained through community owner-<lb/>
ship of land. Though not a designer, his diagram-<lb/>
matic model for a garden city became the schematic basis for the layout of actual new towns (fig. 12.2). Autonomous urban entities&#x2014;full-scale communi-<lb/>
ties with industrial and commercial employment&#x2014; not suburbs, Howard's garden cities were conceived as an interconnected network of population centers linked by electric rail to one another and to a larger central garden city. He envisioned each satellite town as having a 1,000-acre core and a 5,000-acre rural belt, with a population of 30,000 living in the center and 2,000 in the agricultural surroundings. Each town was to be divided into wards containing 5,000 inhabitants, and each ward was to contain a school. In the heart of the town, civic and cultural institutions would ring a green open space, and between these and the inner ring of houses and gar-<lb/>
dens was to be a spacious Central Park. A second ring of houses and gardens lay beyond a wide Grand Avenue. Conveniently encircling these was a local railway looping off the main line. Factories were to be placed adjacent to this railway spur, with agricul-<lb/>
tural allotments, pastures, orchards, woodlots, and institutions for orphans, epileptics, and convales-<lb/>
cents located in the greenbelt beyond it.</p>

<p>In <date when="1899">1899</date>, Howard founded the Garden City Association, the organization that fostered the two primary manifestations of his ideal: <name type="pname">Letchworth</name> (<date when="1903">1903</date>) and Welwyn Garden City (<date when="1919">1919</date>). To launch Letchworth, Howard obtained the assistance of <name type="pname">George Cadbury</name> and <name type="pname">William Lever</name>. The Garden City Pioneer Company Limited, which they incor-<lb/>
porated, acquired 4,000 acres of land 35 miles north of <name type="place">London</name> and created a subsidiary joint stock com-<lb/>
pany to raise capital for construction. <name type="pname">Sir Barry Parker</name> and <name type="pname">Sir Raymond Unwin</name>, who were half cousins, brothers-in-law, Fabians, and devoted fol-<lb/>
lowers of Howard, planned the town, adapting Howard's diagram to the conditions of the site (figs. 12.3a, 12.3b). Because the land was to be trans-<lb/>
ferred to the community at a future date, the restricted dividend stock was not secured with equity and therefore sold sluggishly. But with the establishment of industry, the town did get under way, and its sponsors were able to withstand pres-<lb/>
sure to sell off parcels of property and to develop Howard's experiment much as originally envi-<lb/>
sioned until World War I curtailed their efforts.</p>
<p>Unwin, an architect much concerned with establishing optimal density ratios, championed codes setting a maximum of twelve houses per acre. These were designed as attached units, with steep-<lb/>

pitched rooflines and structural massing reminiscent of the Arts and Crafts style of <name type="pname">Edwin Lutyens</name> or <name type="pname">Charles Francis Annesley Voysey</name> (<date when="1857">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1941">1941</date>), a British archi-<lb/>
tect expert in attractive, functional design for the mod-<lb/>
est home. Unwin's illustrations for his book <hi rend="italic">Town Planning in Practice</hi> (<date when="1909">1909</date>) demonstrate his meticu-<lb/>
lous attention to various planning schemes and the details of design at Letchworth. He worked also in Hampstead Garden Suburb, which he designed within the confines of metropolitan <name type="place">London</name> in <date when="1907">1907</date> as a cor-<lb/>
ollary to the effort local citizens mounted to extend Hampstead Heath and to frustrate the construction of a planned underground city railway station. Borrowing from the German and English vernacular traditions, he employed irregular and nonuniform street alignments and an Arts and Crafts architectural vocabulary for his building blocks in order to create a richly picturesque environment for the working- and middle-class small-<lb/>
home leaseholder (fig. 12.4). The garden city ideal upheld by Unwin placed a premium upon clearly artic-<lb/>
ulated pedestrian and vehicular circulation, street and building composition, and the provision of ample and carefully arranged greenery and recreational facilities. His circulation plan reduced the amount of land occu-<lb/>
pied by roads from a typical 40 percent to 17 percent. Hampstead Garden Suburb reinforced a British prefer-<lb/>
ence for living at low densities and at ground level within metropolitan areas rather than in high-rise apart-<lb/>
ment blocks, as was the practice on the Continent. It did not, however, serve the varied classes for whom it was intended, as its attractiveness soon caused it to be occupied more or less exclusively by the well-to-do.</p>

<p>Like the fathers of the garden city movement in Brit-<lb/>
ain, Camillo Sitte had sought in Austria to preserve the flavor of a cozier, older way of life by applying the aesthetic of the Picturesque to the modern industrial city. Others, however, equated beauty with Machine Age functionality. Among these were Sitte's Viennese contemporary Otto Wagner (<date when="1841">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1918">1918</date>). Wagner envisioned the modern metropolis in terms of highly systematized regimental order, with uniform building blocks, wide transportation corridors, and spacious greenery arranged according to a Neoclassical monu-<lb/>
mental planning paradigm (fig. 12.5). Thus, within an apparently similar design framework, Wagner's pro-<lb/>
posal for the new metropolis was even more resolutely modern in orientation than Baron Haussmann's radical reinvention of <name type="place">Paris</name>.</p>
<p>Showing greater sensitivity to the texture of everyday life than did Wagner, the Beaux-Arts-trained, protofunctionalist French architect Tony Garnier (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1948">1948</date>) made an important contribution to the development of visionary urban planning. In <date when="1899">1899</date>, Garnier won the Prix de <name type="place">Rome</name>, the prestigious fellow-<lb/>
ship to study at the French Academy in <name type="place">Rome</name> where he was a <hi rend="italic">pensionnaire</hi> until <date when="1904">1904</date>. Rather than following the prescribed didactic program of classical archi-<lb/>
tectural study, however, Garnier, who was attracted to the growing liberalism of the times, used his stay in <name type="place">Rome</name> to work on a plan for "Une Cit&#x00E9; Industrielle." This would be located in southeastern <name type="place">France</name>, the region of his native Lyons, a center for textile manu-<lb/>
facturing, metallurgy, and the nascent automobile industry. In design terms, Garnier's plan expressed his belief that the past was morally bankrupt and that his-<lb/>
toricizing architecture was an affectation and therefore suspect, a premise shared by others who also were attempting to develop the building forms of a new democratic age. These architects postulated a radical break with history, eschewing design continuity with the past.</p>
<p>Although Garnier's architecture boldly em-braced
<pb n="407"/>
<pb n="407" type="orig"/>
modern construction technology, relying especially upon reinforced concrete as a building material, as an urban planner he was far less polem-<lb/>
ical and doctrinaire than several architectural mod-<lb/>
ernists of the succeeding generation. Conceptually, he was closer in spirit to the proponents of the gar-<lb/>
den city movement. Its tenets were undoubtedly familiar to him, for in <date when="1902">1902</date>, Howard's <hi rend="italic">Garden Cities of To-Morrow</hi> was published in a French translation. Garnier's classical training at the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-<lb/>
Arts ensured a more geometrically ordered approach than that of his British contemporaries with their lingering taste for the irregularities of the Pictur-<lb/>
esque. While he lacked their proclivity for vernacu-<lb/>
lar architectural style, the problem he wished to solve&#x2014;that of building economically sound, livable communities&#x2014;was the same.</p>
<p>Garnier's Cit&#x00E9; Industrielle was oriented to the natural landscape as well as to a social ideal. Although its site was not specific, he imagined a particular topography, locating his imaginary town on hilly terrain overlooking a valley formed by the Rhone and one of its tributaries. Industry would guarantee it a viable economic foundation, and com-<lb/>
mon ownership of land and intelligent planning, including the provision of educational, civic, cul-<lb/>
tural, athletic, and medical facilities, would offer the intellectual and physical amenities appropriate to the democratic social values of a new age. Designed for a population of 35,000, it was to have no defined perimeter boundaries and ample amounts of unbuilt land between functionally separate areas. These res-<lb/>
ervations of open space would allow for some nec-<lb/>
essary expansion. This type of zoning according to land use, now commonplace in cities, was innova-<lb/>
tive in the early twentieth century. Innovative, too, were the proposed sanitary and traffic standards, regulations providing for eminent domain, and con-<lb/>
trols over the supply of water, bread, milk, and med-<lb/>
icines.</p>
<p>Garnier drew voluminous plans and produced numerous perspective drawings that have an engag-<lb/>
ing quotidian specificity (fig. 12.6). His laconic text is explanatory, not hortatory. In proposing a site, he considered the availability of hydroelectric power to generate electricity for the factories and the town and the presence of minerals and other raw materials for manufacturing. He then arranged the town in three well-spaced tiers: its industrial zone containing blast furnaces, steel mills, assembly plants, engi-<lb/>
neering laboratories, and workshops in the plain beside the river and the railway line; residential blocks and the town center on a plateau above these; and, higher still, hospital buildings arranged on a series of sloping terraces. Like the houses of the town, these would have southern exposures and be shielded from the wind. Overall, Garnier's plan called for construction to occupy less than half the site with the remainder devoted to landscaping and a public pedestrian way.</p>

<figDesc><hi rend="bold">12.6. Domestic quarter, <hi rend="italic">Une Cit&#x00E9; Industrielle.</hi> The stripped-<lb/>
down appearance of Garnier's houses did not mean a banish-<lb/>
ment of ornament and color, only a more neutral back-<lb/>
ground to heighten the expres-<lb/>
sive potential of freestanding works of art than was the case when decoration was conceived as integral with architec-<lb/>
ture. Garnier felt that the use of poured concrete and cement resulted in "large horizontal and vertical surfaces, endowing the buildings with a sense of calm and balance in harmony with the natural contours of the landscape." He established a web of connecting footpaths independent of the street sys-<lb/>
tem throughout the entire town so as to create "a huge park, free of enclosures and barriers delimiting individual plots of land."</hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>With its places of public assembly, Greek-style open-air theater, gymnasiums, fields for sports, run-<lb/>
ning and cycling tracks, areas for discus throwing and high jumping, and other athletic facilities, the Cit&#x00E9; Industrielle illustrated both a spiritual and phy-<lb/>
sical kinship with the ancient Greek city. There is, moreover, a pleasing Mediterranean-style modernity to Garnier's cubelike, unornamented buildings of reinforced concrete. In addition to the primary schools planned for each of the town's neighbor-<lb/>
hoods, there were to be secondary schools for indus-<lb/>
trial, administrative, and professional trade studies. One professional school was intended to train those seeking careers in the fine and commercial arts&#x2014; architecture, painting, sculpture, and related areas of design, including decorative and practical work in fabric, ceramic, glass, and metal.</p>
<p>Unlike later radical modernists who saw the destruction of historical building fabric and artifacts as liberating, Garnier's vision made room for the old town, and his cultural quarter was to contain in addi-<lb/>
tion to a botanical garden, greenhouse, library, and exhibition hall, a museum for "historical collections and important archaeological, artistic, industrial and commercial documents relating to the town." More-<lb/>
over, Garnier decreed that "monuments will be erected in the park surrounding the rooms contain-<lb/>
ing the archives." For the secular and peaceful society he envisioned, there was no need to provide churches or military barracks.</p>
<p>Garnier's plan languished, although he man-<lb/>
aged to get it published twice&#x2014;in <date when="1914">1914</date> when he was director of the International Urban Exhibition in Lyons and again in <date when="1931">1931</date>. As a practicing architect in Lyons with strong ties to the socialist mayor Edouard Herriot (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>), Garnier obtained commis-<lb/>
sions to build some of the components envisioned in
<pb n="408"/>
<pb n="408" type="orig"/>
his Cit&#x00E9; Industrielle. These included a hospital, sani-<lb/>
tarium, sports stadium, post office and telecommuni-<lb/>
cations headquarters, art college, weaving school, employment exchange, the &#x00C9;tats Unis residential dis-<lb/>
trict, and memorials to war victims. Although he never saw his comprehensive plan for a parklike town real-<lb/>
ized, it nonetheless became a landmark in the history of twentieth-century city planning. Garnier's pioneer-<lb/>
ing concept of low-rise housing, separate systems of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and an array of facilities addressing the diverse needs of people for environmental safety, health, education, employment, recreation, entertainment, and politics remains a nota-<lb/>
ble expression of the belief in rational, comprehensive, socially oriented planning that characterized the archi-<lb/>
tectural profession in the first half of the twentieth cen-<lb/>
tury.</p>

<p>In Spain, Ildefons Cerd&#x00E0; (<date when="1816">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), an engineer and the author of <hi rend="italic">Teor&#x00ED;a General de Urbanizaci&#x00F3;n</hi> (<date when="1867">1867</date>), saw circulation as the primary definer of city form. He grasped how predominant modes of locomotion cata-<lb/>
lyzed urban transformations as cities built with narrow ways for foot traffic changed their street patterns and widths to accommodate equestrians and later wheeled vehicles. In <date when="1859">1859</date>, Cerd&#x00E0; designed the Eixample, the planned extension of the city all around medieval Bar-<lb/>
celona, as checkerboard blocks with each square hav-<lb/>
ing chamfered corners to accommodate better the turning radii of carriages (fig. 12.7).</p>
<p>In Madrid, a generation later <name type="pname">Arturo Soria y Mata</name> (<date when="1844">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1920">1920</date>) carried Cerd&#x00E0;'s interest in locomotion a step further. Realizing that the rapid-transit line linking city and suburb could establish yet another urban form, Soria proposed in <date when="1882">1882</date> <hi rend="italic">La ciudad lineal,</hi> a linear city with a single <date when="1640">1640</date>-foot-wide (500-meter-wide) street of indeterminate length (fig. 12.8). Boldly, Soria envi-<lb/>
sioned this artery not only as a transportation corridor but also as an immense belt of utilities and services including water, gas, and electric lines, reservoirs and public gardens, and stations for various municipal ser-<lb/>
vices. Settlement was to occur in orthogonal blocks along secondary streets perpendicular to the central spine, with houses occupying only one-fifth of each building lot. A small piece of Soria's scheme was real-<lb/>
ized: 13 miles (22 kilometers) of a 34-mile (55-kilome-<lb/>
ter) planned linear city outside Madrid.</p>
<pb n="409"/>
<pb n="409" type="orig"/>
<p>In contrast to the purely technological approach of Soria, the Catalan industrialist <name type="pname">Eusebi G&#x00FC;ell</name> (<date when="1846">1846</date>&#x2014; <date when="1918">1918</date>) and his architect <name type="pname">Antonio Gaud&#x00ED;</name> (<date when="1852">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1926">1926</date>) attempted in the construction of Park G&#x00FC;ell between <date when="1900">1900</date> and <date when="1914">1914</date> to express Barcelona's transformation into a modern industrial city still tied to its indigenous cultural, spiritual, and technological heritage (figs. 12.11&#x2013;12.15). Park G&#x00FC;ell was originally intended as a suburban alternative to the increasingly crowded city that the magnate saw filling the blocks outlined by Cerd&#x00E0;'s Eixample. G&#x00FC;ell had already exhibited a con-<lb/>
cern similar to Lever's at Port Sunlight in the construc-<lb/>
tion of Col&#x00F2;nia G&#x00FC;ell to house his textile workers. His new project would allow middle-class Barcelonans to escape the city's growing clamor and congestion. Per-<lb/>
haps more important, it would encode into its architec-<lb/>
tural fabric emblems of the Catalan "regional soul" as promoted by the Catholic revival in which both G&#x00FC;ell and Gaud&#x00ED; were active participants.</p>
<p>Park G&#x00FC;ell's creation occurred within the period of the <hi rend="italic">Renaixen&#x00E7;a,</hi> the renascence of Catalan tradi-<lb/>
tions, including that of religious pilgrimage and peni-<lb/>
tential piety, led by Barcelona's cultural elite. Neither this movement nor the park is as anomalous as one might imagine at first. They sprang from a regional variant of the impulse to revalidate folkways, ancient rituals, craft traditions, and vernacular idioms of lan-<lb/>
guage, architecture, ornament, and dress that was occurring simultaneously in other places. Not unex-<lb/>
pectedly, given the rapidly changing, increasingly rootless, secular nature of the times, conservative men such as G&#x00FC;ell and Gaud&#x00ED; sought to reconnect their soci-<lb/>
ety with history, as powerfully represented by the Catholic Church. Religious societies planned excur-<lb/>
sions by rail into the surrounding countryside where members visited thousand-year-old Romanesque churches, cave shrines, and mountain sanctuaries. Bar-<lb/>
celonans revived the <hi rend="italic">sardana,</hi> a regional folk dance still performed in the city's cathedral square. The Joc Florals, a poetry and rhetoric festival established in <date when="1859">1859</date>, celebrated the Catalan language and the tradition of Proven&#x00E7;al troubadours. The architect Llu&#x00ED;s Dom&#x00E9;nech y Montaner (<date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1923">1923</date>) led a crafts revival that successfully integrated craft technolo-<lb/>
gies&#x2014;particularly those of ceramics and metal-<lb/>
work&#x2014;with the industrial arts, resulting in the robust ornamental plasticity that characterizes many of Bar-<lb/>
celona's buildings today (fig. 12.9). That Gaud&#x00ED; was a scion of coppersmiths was an important factor in his development as an architect.</p>
<p>Park G&#x00FC;ell occupies an especially interesting position in the history of landscape design because of G&#x00FC;ell and Gaud&#x00ED;'s attempt to synthesize cosmopolitan progress and ethnic conservatism. Gaud&#x00ED; combined modern industrial technologies and ancient craft tradi-<lb/>
tions to create forms that are both witty and soberly pious. He built upon the symbolical identification of the steep site&#x2014;located on the southeast side of Muntanya Pelada (Bald Mountain), also referred to as Mount Car-<lb/>
mel&#x2014;with the sacred mountain of Montserrat. After the fortuitous discovery of a cave and mineral spring on the property, he used the natural materials of the site to fashion other forms suggestive of an antediluvian holy landscape. Elevated to greatness by Gaud&#x00ED;'s genius and the superbly imaginative craftsmanship of Catalan artisans, Park G&#x00FC;ell is a landscape curiosity, a failed uto-<lb/>
pian experiment and Industrial Age vision of paradise. It is also a more elegant and refined, but not-too-distant, cousin to the midway plaisances of the world's fairs&#x2014; low-brow amusement areas such as the one that pro-<lb/>
vided a piquant counterpoint to the elevated cultural ambience of the <date when="1893">1893</date> <name type="place">Chicago</name> World's Fair&#x2014;and the delightfully garish amusement parks such as Luna Park and Steeplechase at Coney Island with which it is con-<lb/>
temporary. Like these, it sought to imbue landscape with evocations of the fantastic and supernatural.</p>

<q>Upon entering the park, one passes between two gatehouses <hi rend="bold">C</hi>. Designed practically to accommodate residents, arriving guests, and concierge, they never-<lb/>
theless have a fairy-tale aspect with their candylike encrusted surfaces. Gaud&#x00ED; cre-<lb/>
ated the fluid parabolic curves of their surg-<lb/>

nated to form vaulting.</q>
<q>Beyond the gatehouses lies the entry vestibule with its enigmatic clues and teas-<lb/>
ing symbols. As festive and welcoming as a contemporary theme park, like Disney World's Magic Kingdom, this space is replete with pseudo-Gothic heraldic motifs. A grand stairway <hi rend="bold">D</hi>, which splits in two halfway down, is encased by low walls embellished with reassembled pieces of broken tile in a pattern called <hi rend="italic">trencad&#x00ED;s,</hi> a traditional Catalan mosaic technique (fig. 12.11).

orated with a bold checkerboard design using the same mosaic technique. Gaud&#x00ED;'s deliberate smashing of newly fired tile and its application to curving surfaces exempli-<lb/>
fies his creativity in adapting traditional craft forms to new and original artistic ends.</q>
<q>This space, while essentially cheerful, is also vaguely disquieting. It is made ambiguous by the presence of a shadowy grotto in the triangle created by the bifurca-<lb/>

<q>The grand stairs <hi rend="bold">D</hi> ascend to the imposing Market Hall <hi rend="bold">B</hi> with its forest of columns. If the sixty families projected to take up residence there had done so, this hypostyle hall might have functioned as intended. It remains, instead, a curious and impressive untenanted space, a demon-<lb/>
stration of Gaud&#x00ED;'s virtuosic technical skills and protean imagination as an architect. Monumental Doric columns rise to support a massive roof platform. This acts as the floor surface of the Greek Theater <hi rend="bold">B</hi>, a large elevated plaza intended for civic and religious rituals and such expressions of Catalan folk culture as the popular <hi rend="italic">sardana</hi> dances. Like a Mannerist conceit, a wide, high-backed, curving bench blocks imme-<lb/>
diate entrance from the stairs into this open hall, and the architect has provided no vis-<lb/>
ible clue as to any means of entry into it. Once the visitor has found the route inside, the powerful fluted columns, the pearly-<lb/>
toned <hi rend="italic">trencad&#x00ED;s</hi> work in the ceiling's multi-<lb/>
ple shallow domes, and the great round ceiling medallions by the artist Josep Maria Jujol vie for primacy in producing the stron-<lb/>
gest impression.</q>
<q>The wavy entablature of the Market Hall is surmounted by a serpentine bench, added after <date when="1909">1909</date> when Park G&#x00FC;ell's con-<lb/>
struction program was coming to a close. Here, surrounding the entire perimeter of the Greek Theater, Jujol created a ceramic masterpiece, sheathing Gaud&#x00ED;'s gently undulating, biomorphic balcony and con-<lb/>
tinuous seat with a boldly brilliant mosaic containing numerous liturgically symbolic colors, emblems, and inscriptions (fig. 12.14).</q>
<q>Adapted to the steep topography of the site, the circulation system consists of gently inclined promenades or principal avenues 33 feet (10 meters) wide; some-<lb/>
what steeper carriage roads having a width of 16.5 feet (5 meters); 10-foot- (3-meter-) wide connector paths for pedestrians; and <hi rend="italic">dreceras,</hi> or narrow ways with steps to facilitate climbing, in areas too steep for conventional pedestrian paths.</q>
<q>While Gaud&#x00ED;'s circulation system con-<lb/>
formed generally to the dictates of topogra-<lb/>
phy, to avoid narrow switchbacks and hairpin turns he made the roads loop broadly, creating the need for structural support where there was no ground plane beneath them. He treated the undersides of the bridges that carry these sections of the roadbed as vaulted porticos dressed with rough-hewn masonry, making them appear as cavelike chambers, integral parts of the surrounding stony landscape. Here he employed the same Catalan <hi rend="italic">b&#x00F3;veda tabi-<lb/>
cada</hi> system used in the gatehouses, cant-<lb/>
ing support columns and splaying their capitals so that they merge with the portico ceiling, dressing the whole in rough-hewn native stone and creating in this fluid para-<lb/>

tions in industrial technology.</p>
<p>The fact that G&#x00FC;ell anglicized the name of his real-estate development, spelling it "park" instead of <hi rend="italic">parc</hi> (Catalan) or <hi rend="italic">parque</hi> (Spanish), indicated a con-<lb/>
scious association with the English landscape tradi-<lb/>
tion, both in its eighteenth-century manifestation in such gardens as Stowe and Stourhead and in its con-<lb/>
temporary garden city one, as at Letchworth. Gaud&#x00ED; used an indigenous symbolism to create a twenti-<lb/>
eth-century sacralized Catalan version of <hi rend="italic">the jardin anglais.</hi> Here, instead of valorizing the industrial present with evocations of a classical Arcadia, he dra-<lb/>
matized the sacredness of the rough prehistoric Cata-<lb/>
lan landscape with emblems of a pilgrim's progress toward Paradise combined with a vividly organic imagery derived from regional nature.</p>
<p>In planning their residential refuge, G&#x00FC;ell and Gaud&#x00ED; rejected the orthogonal lines of Cerd&#x00E0;'s Eixam-<lb/>
ple in much the way that Olmsted and Vaux rejected the grid in their plans for Central Park and the suburb of Riverside, <name type="place">Illinois</name> (fig. 12.10; see figs. 9.34, 9.48). Not only did they follow the dictates of topography in the Park G&#x00FC;ell's curvilinear road system, but because it represented a paradisiacal place, they also demar-<lb/>
cated the development with walls and an elaborate entrance gate to set it apart from the rest of the city.<ref target="#CH12-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref> They made the experience of coming into the park akin to participating in a mystical pageant by furnish-<lb/>
ing its entrance with an elaborate set of symbols appro-<lb/>
priate to the as yet uninitiated pilgrim embarking on a journey of pious discovery&#x2014;Poliphilus in Colonna's <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,</hi> Dante in <hi rend="italic">The Divine Comedy,</hi> and Prince Tamino in Mozart's <hi rend="italic">The Magic Flute</hi> come to mind. These are embodied in several original and highly plastic forms (fig. 12.12). In designing them Gaud&#x00ED; did not rely on blueprints. Instead, he was there, on the job, sketching, directing, and continually innovating&#x2014;creatively marrying ancient craft with contemporary industrial technology.</p>
<p>Park G&#x00FC;ell's functionally segregated circulation system, like that of Central Park, was an object of con-<lb/>
siderable attention, also providing the opportunity for a series of bridges of great originality and design dis-<lb/>
tinction. While the spiritual benefits intended to be derived from passage through Central Park on foot, horseback, or carriage were characterized by Olmsted as being of a "poetic" nature&#x2014;the benign influence of nature operating on the senses and the soul&#x2014;Gaud&#x00ED;'s system of roads and paths had a more specifically reli-<lb/>
gious intent and program. All routes wound upward to a stone cairn surmounted by three stone crosses sym-<lb/>
bolizing Calvary, or Golgotha, the hill of Jesus' Cruci-<lb/>
fixion. Gaud&#x00ED; intended the climb to this highest point in the park, an energetic Sunday promenade, to recall the famous pilgrimage routes in the Pyrenees, particu-<lb/>
larly the one leading to Montserrat, Catalonia's holy mountain and refuge of monks and martyrs. Visible from this high point are the spires of Gaud&#x00ED;'s Church of the Sacred Family and much of the rest of Barcelo-<lb/>
na's urban landscape.</p>
<p>For the mystically inclined architect as well as for the proprietor of Park G&#x00FC;ell, the site was <hi rend="italic">both</hi> alle-<lb/>
gorical and invested with its own sacred significance. The bishop of Vic actively encouraged the spread into Catalonia of the nineteenth-century cult of grotto sanctuaries that originated in <name type="place">France</name> and was conspic-<lb/>
uously manifested at Lourdes. The network of caves within Muntanya Pelada, discovered shortly after G&#x00FC;ell had ordered work to begin on the site, validated his belief in a thematic treatment and gave Gaud&#x00ED;'s improvisatory genius the opportunity for fresh flights of architectural fantasy. Not only was Gaud&#x00ED; cooper-<lb/>
ating in the creation of a hieratic landscape, he was also countering Enlightenment rationalism and its corollary, modern industrial engineering, with a seem-<lb/>
ingly organic architecture that used local craft tech-<lb/>
nique to fashion indigenous building materials into an expression that appeared to be deeply rooted in the land. Inventively seeking ways of making architecture appear organic, Gaud&#x00ED; employed the helix in his spiral ramp for the portico adjacent to the Greek Theater. Here, one of nature's most elegant and prevalent pat-<lb/>
terns is used to ingenious effect.</p>
<p>Although Gaud&#x00ED;'s style is sometimes associated with the curvilinear forms and vegetal motifs of the Art Nouveau movement, his goals were different. Per-<lb/>
haps the greatest and certainly the most ardent practi-<lb/>
tioner of Expressionism, the architectural style that flourished during the first quarter of the twentieth century, Gaud&#x00ED; sought to find an idiom outside of any cultural conventions or historical references, to evoke sensations from free-form sculptural elements. Because he mystically associated nature with the symbolism of a Catalonian nationalism deeply rooted in Roman Catholicism, the existence of real caves on the site merely impelled him further in a direction prompted by religion. Taking his cues from the "book of nature," which he believed was the creation of God, he intended to deny Darwin and scientific rationalism and to substantiate creationism through a biomorphic and geomorphic architectural imagery expressive of the prebiblical, prehistoric landscape. At the same time, though laden with this symbolic intent, the structures attached to the roads and other cavelike recesses served quite practical, nonmeta-phorical ends, providing sheltered seating, storage space, and other amenities.</p>

<p>Inherent problems thwarted the complete reali-<lb/>
zation of G&#x00FC;ell and Gaud&#x00ED;'s visionary plan. Title to the parcels G&#x00FC;ell planned to sell was hedged with regula-<lb/>
tions stating that only one-sixth of a lot could be cov-<lb/>
ered with buildings, that building height and location be set according to a formula that ensured the view lines of all other residences, that walls along property lines be no higher than 32 inches (80 centimeters) from the ground, that no trees over six inches in diam-<lb/>
eter be removed. Unlike Howard, G&#x00FC;ell did not set up a corporation to administer his proposed community in perpetuity. Rather, he left vague his commitment to the future provision of services and maintenance, inserting in his proposed contract of sale an escape clause for the proprietor, specifying that the residents were to form an association for such purposes. As a result, the lots remained unsold, and the estate became the private refuge of G&#x00FC;ell, Gaud&#x00ED;, and another family closely related to G&#x00FC;ell. In <date when="1923">1923</date>, five years after G&#x00FC;ell's death, his heirs transferred the property to the municipality of Barcelona to administer as a public park. Today it is one of the most visited parks in the city.</p>

<p>Though secular rather than religious in their outlook, European radical modernists possessed a fervor equal to that of the Catalonian Renaixen&#x00E7;a leaders in their attempts to create new human environments appropri-<lb/>
ate to the Industrial Age. They romanticized the speeded-up future enabled by machine technology. The Futurists, as a group of young Milanese artists and intellectuals called themselves, were particularly enamored of high-speed motion and mechanized power. Among their ranks was the architect <name type="pname">Antonio Sant'Elia</name> (<date when="1888">1888</date>&#x2013;<date when="1916">1916</date>) whose <hi rend="italic">Cili&#x00E0; Nuova</hi> proposal abandoned Haussmannesque urban retrofitting for the modern age in favor of a clean start. All traces of the past are swept away to allow skyscrapers to rise boldly above circulation corridors arranged on multiple lev-<lb/>
els (fig. 12.15). Engineering, rather than social con-<lb/>
cern, characterizes Sant'Elia's proposal: intersecting layers of underground railways, highways, pedestrian skyways, and even an airport runway passing above and below one another by means of great viaducts and bridges. Elevators provide vertical access between levels and within the tall buildings.</p>
<p>At the same time, in <date when="1903">1903</date>, Austrian architect Josef Hoffmann (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1956">1956</date>) founded the Wiener Werkst&#x00E4;tte with painter and furniture designer Kolo-<lb/>
man Moser (<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x2013;<date when="1918">1918</date>). This studio of collaborative architects and artisans offered an Arts and Crafts alter-<lb/>
native to Machine Age modernity. In <name type="place">Germany</name>, early modernism united the Arts and Crafts tradition as practiced by architect Peter Behrens (<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x2013;<date when="1940">1940</date>)&#x2014;a follower of William Morris and one of the founders in <date when="1907">1907</date> of the Deutscher Werkbund in Munich&#x2014;with a the Machine Age aes-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">Walter Gropius</name> (<date when="1883">1883</date>&#x2013;<date when="1969">1969</date>), a student in Beh-<lb/>

Gropius pre-<lb/>
mised the curriculum of the Bauhaus, as he named the school, upon the Werkbund's ethos of developing an indigenous German art based on sound construction and the collaborative effort of architects, artists, and artisans. Students were trained to respect the particular characteristics of wood and other natural materials. By <date when="1923">1923</date>, however, Gropius had abandoned the Expres-<lb/>
sionist mood that had infused early Bauhaus instruc-<lb/>
tion in architecture and had turned away from the Werkbund's belief that craft ideals should influence industrial design toward an emphasis upon machine technology. The functional design and industrial mate-<lb/>
rials of the school's new quarters that Gropius built in Dessau (<date when="1925">1925</date>&#x2013;26) became a visible manifesto of the Bauhaus's evolved mission to promote new building methods. Socialism was implicit, too, in Gropius's architecture. He saw machine technology as the carrier of a different kind of design beauty from that of the more labor-intensive, and thereby more expensive, Arts and Crafts aesthetic. By abandoning handiwork ornament in favor of a more abstract architectural aesthetic based on composition alone, architects could bring a more commodious life to more people than ever before. Industrial building parts were relatively inexpensive, especially compared with ornamental, hand-carved stone, and less-skilled architects than Gropius could achieve satisfactory, if not particularly inspired, results employing them in modular designs.<ref target="#CH12-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Subsequently characterized as one of the pro-<lb/>

cal in their anti-authoritarianism. For them, orna-<lb/>
ment&#x2014;the carrier of iconographies of power and of symbolism associated with aristocratic grandeur and monarchical rule&#x2014;appeared superfluous and possi-<lb/>

<p>Their avant-garde cosmopolitanism was anath-<lb/>
ema to political conservatives, particularly to nation-<lb/>
alists, and to members of Adolf Hitler's Nazi (National Socialist) Party, who preferred a traditional style rooted in the German Picturesque and, in the case of monumental public buildings, a sober classicism that glorified the power of the State. Gropius's new Bau-<lb/>
haus in Dessau existed barely a decade before he and his colleagues became part of the diaspora of German intellectuals who left Europe after <date when="1933">1933</date> when Hitler came to power. Gropius became the head of the archi-<lb/>
tectural program at Harvard, and this, along with the exodus of many other German and Austrian modern-<lb/>
ists, hastened the acceptance of the International Style as an archi-<lb/>
tectural idiom in the United States.</p>
<p>Gropius's contemporary, the Swiss-born architect <name type="pname">Charles Edouard Jeanneret</name>, known as Le Corbus-<lb/>
ier (<date when="1887">1887</date>&#x2013;<date when="1965">1965</date>), extended the premises of the International Style to the most traditional of human structures, the home, which he memorably defined as "a machine for living." He shared with the Futurists an enthusiasm for dynamic motion and boldness of scale, which he manifested in city-planning schemes that welcomed the automobile with wider roadways, while expanding traditional city blocks into a super-<lb/>
block grid scaled to provide abundant light and air around tall residential towers.</p>

</figure>
<p>While his indifference to specific economic, political, and social realities ensured that his plans remained largely on paper, Le Corbusier's Olympian pronouncements and his tireless program of publica-<lb/>
tion assured lasting and far-reaching influence for his planning paradigms and proposals. Like Sant'Elia, he saw that the city might be more dense and also more open if motorized transportation systems operated both vertically and horizontally, and, like Soria, he appreciated the linear spine as a means of planned decentralization and industrial dispersal. He held in contempt Sitte and other practitioners of the Pictur-<lb/>
esque style in architecture, and he deplored <name type="place">New York</name>'s skyscrapers because these were placed cheek by jowl within a preexisting street pattern rather than set upon a much more loosely woven grid of spacious superblocks filled with sunlight and greenery.</p>
<p>Without subscribing to its proponents' density ratios or proposed satellite clusters, Le Corbusier appropriated the virtues of the garden city&#x2014;plentiful sunlight, abundant recreational open space, and ease of movement&#x2014;as his principal objectives. Biology furnished him with numerous images&#x2014;"BIOLOGY! The great new word in architecture and planning," he once declared&#x2014;but his idea of organic planning was metaphorical and, above all, architectural rather than environmental. The stunning setting of Rio de Janeiro, for instance, provoked in him "the strong desire, a bit mad perhaps, to attempt here a human adventure&#x2014; the desire to set up a duality, to create ‘the affirmation of man' against or with ‘the presence of nature.'"<ref target="#CH12-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> He then sketched a 328-foot- (100-meter-) high motor-<lb/>
way looping the city in an arc around its beautiful harbor, the upper deck a continuous structure contain-<lb/>
ing apartments, the lower band of which would begin almost 100 feet (30 meters) from the ground, presum-<lb/>
ably clearing the tops of any existing buildings (fig. 12.16).</p>
<p>But this modernist, romantically homocentric response to setting characterized only Le Corbusier's encounters with real sites such as that of the Villa Savoye (<date when="1929">1929</date>&#x2013;31) at Poissy, where he designed a structure raised on pilotis with views across a broad meadow, an intended evocation of the Latin poet Vir-<lb/>
gil's urbane pastoralism. His theoretical plans, on the other hand, envisioned flat, featureless plains upon which to inscribe rationalistic architectonics. Classi-<lb/>
cism, Cartesian geometry, and admiration for author-<lb/>
itarian leaders&#x2014;exemplified in his respect for the achievements of Louis XIV (Place V&#x00EA;ndome, Inva-<lb/>
lides, Versailles), Louis XV (Place de la Concorde) and Napol&#x00E9;on I (Champ de Mars, L'&#x00C9;toile)&#x2014;under-<lb/>

<pb n="415" type="orig"/>
superblocks occupied by tall, freestanding, slablike buildings where people would live in practically iden-<lb/>
tical two-story "freehold maisonettes" furnished with terraces (fig. 12.18). Employing one of his favorite biological metaphors, Le Corbusier, who felt that the highly mobile population of the modern age need no longer harbor sentimental notions of home and hearth, called these residential units "cells." Industry was to be located outside the city proper, and workers, compris-<lb/>
ing two million of the three million inhabitants, would be located in "garden cities" nearby.</p>

<p>Besides providing a paradigm for the contempo-<lb/>
rary servantless apartment dwelling, Le Corbusier's plan of a City for Three Million Inhabitants anticipated the fitness culture of today with its plethora of athletic facilities: tennis courts, swimming pools, soccer fields, and rooftop running tracks and sunbathing areas. As the buildings were raised on pilotis, paths could pass beneath them, forming a network of pedestrian ways independent of the arteries for vehicular circulation. An underground commuter railroad linking the center with the industrial suburbs and a metropolitan subway would provide mass transit. Like Sant'Elia, Le Cor-<lb/>
busier was fascinated with the idea of landing airplanes in the middle of the city and designed a platform for this purpose on the upper level of his multilevel trans-<lb/>
portation center.</p>
<p>In <date when="1923">1923</date> he published <hi rend="italic">Vers une architecture</hi> (trans-<lb/>
lated in <date when="1927">1927</date> as <hi rend="italic">Towards a New Architecture)</hi> in which he enunciated "three reminders to architects." These principles exerted a profound influence on modernist landscape architects, some of whose work we will examine in Chapter Thirteen. Here Le Corbusier main-<lb/>
tained that architecture is an art of mass based on cubes, spheres, cones, cylinders, or pyramids&#x2014;forms revealed to our eyes by light; that surfaces should be modulated to accentuate these simple forms; and that architecture should have nothing to do with "the styles" but allow the plan, an abstraction based on mathematics, to serve as a generator of design, a harmonizing force, and the carrier of sensation.</p>
<p>In <date when="1930">1930</date>, at the third Congr&#x00E8;s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) congress in Brussels where the theme was "Rational Methods of Site Plan-<lb/>
ning," Le Corbusier exhibited a plan that he called <hi rend="italic">The Radiant City</hi> (fig. 12.19). Originally conceived as a response to Soviet officials in Moscow who wanted to reorganize the capital, the plan elaborated and refined the repetitive cellular structure within a geometric superblock grid that he had previously developed for the City for Three Million Inhabitants. Here Le Cor-<lb/>
busier created a plan that was capable of expansion on either side of its axial spine. He placed the towers of the administrative and business district on this axis but away from the urban center in much the same position that the corporate office buildings of the La D&#x00E9;fense district occupy in relation to <name type="place">Paris</name> today.</p>

<p>With the exception of the new capital cities of Chandigarh in the Punjab province of India, begun in <date when="1950">1950</date>, and Bras&#x00ED;lia, where in <date when="1956">1956</date> Le Corbusier's disciples L&#x00FA;cio Costa (<date when="1902">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1998">1998</date>) and <name type="pname">Oscar Niemeyer</name> (b. <date when="1907">1907</date>) began erecting a South Amer-<lb/>
ican version of the Radiant City, the CIAM plan-<lb/>
ners did not see their visionary urbanism come to fruition. In Chandigarh, Le Corbusier assigned to his cousin <name type="pname">Pierre Jeanneret</name> responsibility for plan-<lb/>
ning the layout of the city. In a country that had scarcely begun to industrialize, Jeanneret con-<lb/>
ceived a sophisticated road system far in advance of the demands of actual motorized traffic. In the end, the city's achievements were not those of plan-<lb/>
ning but rather of architecture, notably the capitol complex of monumental government buildings Le Corbusier designed around a vast pedestrian plaza. These include the High Court and the Legislative Assembly with its monumental portico and mas-<lb/>
sive flaring roof, which demonstrate the architect's movement away from the International Style toward a new definition of modernism based on bold experimentation with the sculptural potential of exposed concrete. In Bras&#x00ED;lia, although Niemeyer brought a similar dramatic verve to the major build-<lb/>
ings, the geometric regularity underlying Costa's plan imposed a sense of artificiality on the city. Moreover, the prestigious monumental architecture of the civic centers in these cities was counterbal-<lb/>
anced by the autocratically planned residential areas where people tried with much inconvenience to accommodate their daily movements and living patterns to the monotonously repetitive housing and windswept emptiness of the superblock scale.</p>
<p>In spite of such evident disjunction between the ideal and everyday reality in these early exam-<lb/>
ples of modernist planning, Le Corbusier's reputa-<lb/>
tion and influence upon the contemporary city remained potent. The years following World War II saw the rapid dissemination of the International Style<ref target="#CH12-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref>throughout the capitalist world as the bomb-ravaged cities of <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place">Japan</name> rebuilt themselves and as rapidly urbanizing nations else-<lb/>
where appropriated its aesthetics and architectural forms as the most economical means of building on a large scale within a compressed time frame. Among the generation of architects who came of age in this period, Le Corbusier was revered as one of the principal progenitors of the modernist move-<lb/>
ment they now carried forward. As industrial cities from <name type="place">New York</name> City to <name type="place">Toyko</name>, from Stockholm to Madrid, continued to attract huge populations, increasing numbers of people lived in high-rise slabs modeled superficially on Le Corbusier's Unit&#x00E9; d'Habitation in Marseilles, which was one residential block of a proposed "vertical garden city" for local industrial workers, or in cruciform towers like those of his Radiant City.</p>
<p>No one, certainly not Le Corbusier and the other leaders of the modernist movement, under-<lb/>
stood the full dimensions of the role of the automo-<lb/>
bile in transforming cities and the effect that highways and superhighways would have on cities and countryside alike. The scale of the superblock facilitated motor age traffic, but, because the open space that was to become a network of greenways in the Radiant City usually became parking lots instead, the pedestrian was thwarted. Instead of strengthening the social bond, this loosened the communal fabric and diminished personal security. Born of the twentieth century's enthusiasm for per-<lb/>
sonal mobility and automobile transportation, the highways carrying cars into the hearts of cities made old urban centers very different kinds of places from what they had been previously, raising the question of how much besides a lengthy com-<lb/>
mute had been gained. Nowhere was the effect of modernism's failed promises more evident than in the United States. There, tremendous industrial growth, much of it stimulated by consumer demand for automobiles, accelerated the impact of the machine on the landscape, though at first there was an era of promise as planners and landscape archi-<lb/>
tects sought to design better communities for a new age.</p>

<p>In <name type="place">America</name>, urban planning, which had first been con-<lb/>

lining <name type="place">Washington</name>'s aggrandizement as a monumental city, gradually abandoned the ideals of the City Beau-<lb/>

Although socialism never became as strong a force in <name type="place">America</name> as in Europe, there were some who hoped to place the values of society as a whole above those of Darwinian capitalist competition.

<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">American Visionaries</hi></hi></head>
<p>The generation of visionary reformers that came of age during World War I in <name type="place">America</name> grasped just how profoundly industrialization was transforming society. The economic theories of Henry George and Thor-<lb/>
stein Veblen influenced and supported their belief that land profits should be directed toward the common good and that land planning should rationally partner nature with engineering and technology to provide livable communities. Some recoiled from the impend-<lb/>
ing future of vastly enlarged cities and were uneasy with the purely architectural solutions of European modernists like Le Corbusier, while others embraced skyscraper-scale metropolitanism. Both decentralists and metropolitanists felt that regional planning involv-<lb/>
ing vast engineering projects was now a necessity and that industrial technology provided the means of har-<lb/>
nessing nature's resources for human ends. As plan-<lb/>
ners conceived the new towns and suburbs, the highways and bridges, and the hydroelectric dams and transmission lines that would create an entirely new urban scale, social reformers drew up their plans for remedying the ills of existing cities. Recreation as a means of acculturation for immigrant groups gave birth to the playground movement, and in the early years of the twentieth century the recreation director became a certified professional along with the social worker.</p>

<p>Partly inspired by examples of German garden cities, such as Krupp and Essen, Forest Hills Gardens in Queens, <name type="place">New York</name>, was a garden suburb in the Pic-<lb/>
turesque tradition. The Russell Sage Foundation, the project's sponsor, intended it to be a cozy domestic landscape built according to the latest "scientific prin-<lb/>
ciples" of town planning, an educational demonstrtion to developers of the profitability of an archi- tecturally integrated, exclusively residential community built for middle-class homeowners. Here, in <date when="1909">1909</date>, Olmsted, Jr., laid out three wide principal roads for through traf-<lb/>
fic and a series of gently winding, narrow residential streets (fig. 12.21). By paying close attention to the smallest details of design, including the mellow red-<lb/>
dish tint of stucco and sidewalk cement, the color and

<pb n="418" type="orig"/>
size of brick, which looked aged, not new, and the contrasting effect of white trim and dark, creo-<lb/>
sote-coated oak timbers, architect Grosvenor Atter-<lb/>
bury gave the community's structures a harmonious Gothic-Tudor or German-Tudor, pseudo-medieval appearance. Though quaintly styled, the planned com-<lb/>
munity was innovative in promoting neighborly living in attached row and two-fam-<lb/>
ily houses. These were grouped together so that residents shared front lawns and backyards. There were conventional single-family houses as well. Although Olmsted's design failed to account for the growing trend in automobile own-<lb/>
ership, the generously planted curving streets and the attractively landscaped common ground&#x2014;including a central mall leading to Flagpole Green&#x2014;and the mellow picturesqueness of Atterbury's architecture made this rail- and, later, subway-served garden sub-<lb/>
urb an especially desirable place to live.</p>

<p>Perry saw the neighborhood unit as a means of re-creating the kind of environment conducive to the face-to-face relationships that impersonal big cities were perceived to be destroying. From his Forest Hills Gardens experience he developed a demograph-<lb/>
ic-based formula that provided necessary educational, recreational, and service facilities based on convenient walking radii. Using this model for Yorkship Village, he specified that houses were to be located within a half mile of the local elementary school and its play-<lb/>
ground and no more than a quarter mile distant from local shops, which would be at the juncture of contig-<lb/>
uous neighborhood units. A landscaped village-green-<lb/>
type square, complete with flagpole such as the one found in Forest Hills Gardens, would serve as the focal point for community institutions.</p>
<p>The neighborly, greenbelt-buffered community of low-cost housing approximating Perry's ideal at Yorkship Village was sufficiently attractive to disturb some congressmen who felt that this government-spon-<lb/>
sored development reflected badly upon the nation's private housing industry. As a result, Congress passed legislation mandating that wartime workers' villages be auctioned for sale after the emergency was over, thus curtailing the experiment in public ownership, in the manner of Howard's garden city, based on financial management structured to maintain low rents and turn profits back into community improvements.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">The Regional Planning Association of America</hi></hi></head>
<p>Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, social philosopher, architectural critic, and urban his-<lb/>
torian Lewis Mumford (<date when="1915">1915</date>&#x2013;<date when="1990">1990</date>) was America's most passionate and articulate proponent of metropol-<lb/>
itan decentralization and the creation of new towns. To understand Mumford's planning philosophy and that of his friends and colleagues who formed the Regional Planning Association of <name type="place">America</name>, we must first examine the life and work of Mumford's adopted mentor, <name type="pname">Patrick Geddes</name> (<date when="1854">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1932">1932</date>). The Scottish biologist, sociologist, professor, and pioneer of regional-scale urban planning was the author of <hi rend="italic">Cities in Evolution</hi> (<date when="1915">1915</date>). Geddes's views were influenced by the science of geography, the study of the earth's topography and resources in relation to human settle-<lb/>
ment and economic activity. He read the work of pioneers in this field: &#x00C9;lis&#x00E9;e Reclus (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905">1905</date>), the French anarchist, geographer, and author of the nineteen-volume <hi rend="italic">La Nouvelle G&#x00E9;ogra-<lb/>
phie universelle, la terre et les hommes</hi> (<date when="1875">1875</date>&#x2014;94), and Paul Vidal de la Blache (<date when="1845">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1918">1918</date>), professor of geography in <name type="place">Paris</name>, editor of the periodical <hi rend="italic">Annales de g&#x00E9;ographie,</hi> and author of <hi rend="italic">Atlas g&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;ral; histoire et g&#x00E9;ographie,</hi> (<date when="1894">1894</date>). Geddes was also indebted to the ideas of Fr&#x00E9;d&#x00E9;ric Le Play (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>), the French mining engineer, sociologist, and author of <hi rend="italic">La R&#x00E9;forme sociale en <name type="place">France</name></hi> (<date when="1887">1887</date>). Le Play placed the family rather than the state at the center of the social structure.</p>
<p>Geddes realized that aerial perspective&#x2014;a pre-<lb/>
rogative that tall buildings and later airplanes con-<lb/>
ferred on twentieth-century denizens&#x2014;was a boon for planners in a mass society in which large industrial cities were becoming the norm. Aerial views allowed one to conceive cities whole and to more easily envi-<lb/>
sion urbanism at a metropolitan scale. To see far and wide from on high the shapes of Earth&#x2014;its moun-<lb/>
tains, valleys, winding river courses, and coastlines, as well as the houses, roads, bridges, and other works of human beings&#x2014;fostered regionalism. The panora-<lb/>
mas thus offered were an enormous aid to the geogra-<lb/>
pher, demographer, and urban reformer. As we saw in
<pb n="419"/>
<pb n="419" type="orig"/>
Chapter Ten, the meaning of the Eiffel Tower lay both in its demonstration of the engineering and building technologies of structural steel and in the fact that it allowed visitors to grasp <name type="place">Paris</name> entire, while on their vertiginous descent the city was turned into a kaleido-<lb/>
scope of striking new perspectives.<ref target="#CH12-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>For Geddes, historical information about a city's past could also become comprehensible as, from an elevated perspective, streets and buildings coalesced into patterns describing its habitation in different peri-<lb/>
ods of time. To translate the concept of planning at a regional scale into a graphic plan, Geddes set up his Outlook Tower, equipped with a camera obscura, on the roof of a building at the end of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, where he could physically survey the town and its surrounding river basin. He urged what he termed <hi rend="italic">synoptic</hi> vision, "a seeing of the city, and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis, like city and Acropolis together . . . from hill-top and from sea."<ref target="#CH12-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref>Obviously, more was needed than an overview from an aerie such as the Outlook Tower in order to understand Edinburgh or any other city or region. Geddes advocated what he termed the "Valley Sur-<lb/>
vey" and the "City Survey" to study local landscapes in all their physical, social, economic, and historical dimensions. He aimed to eliminate the artificial sepa-<lb/>
ration between town and country.</p>
<p>Geddes thought in temporal as well as spatial terms. Evolutionary biology provided a popular nine-<lb/>
teenth-century metaphor for cultural transit, and like others of his day, he adopted the notion of cities and civilizations going from dawn to noon to sunset, or from birth to maturity to decline. He saw urbanism as a socially organic process associated with increasing occupational specialization and organizational com-<lb/>
plexity. In this fashion he charted the growth of cities in successive stages, from "polis" to "metropolis" to "megalopolis" and, finally, to "necropolis." He also drew a distinction between "paleotechnic" and "neo-<lb/>
technic" societies. The former denoted the early Industrial Age with its workers living in polluted, crowded, coal-burning towns, their lives directed "toward money wages instead of Vital Budget."<ref target="#CH12-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>The latter possessed new sources of power, including hydroelectricity, which would make possible decen-<lb/>
ralization of populations and the decongestion of existing industrial centers. The cities that were already spreading and coalescing into conurbations were prime candidates for Geddes's recommended "Regional Survey." At the very least, on sanitary grounds and to assure a pure water supply, sensible planning was mandated.</p>
<p>Geddes called the paleotechnic economic order "Kakotopia," a market-driven heedless scramble for profits, whereas the neotechnic order he labeled "Eutopia,... a place of effective health and well-be-<lb/>
ing, even of glorious and in its way unprecedented beauty, renewing and rivaling the best achievements of the past."<ref target="#CH12-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>Geddes clearly had in mind the new garden cities and planned communities then being built in <name type="place">England</name>, which, following Howard's prescrip-<lb/>
tion, extended industrial prosperity to working-class families. He also wanted to reverse the dynamic of the metropolitan organism so that instead of the city's spreading into the country along rail and highway lines and then amorphously infilling the land in between, the country could gain on the city by wedg-<lb/>
ing itself inward in the form of nature preserves (fig. 12.22). Geddes admired the urban parks that had made the nineteenth-century city a greener place, but he saw the need for forestry&#x2014;"no mere tree-cropping, but sylviculture, arboriculture too, and park-making at its greatest and best"<ref target="#CH12-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;as creating opportunities for real freedom in nature unavailable in the metropolitan parks with their fences and palings and their rules designed to maintain decorum befitting the grounds of a mansion.</p>

</figure>
<p>The concept of the city as a complex and evolv-<lb/>
ing social organism captivated the imagination of the young Mumford, who, with his superior and more dis-<lb/>
ciplined literary gifts, elaborated Geddes's message and carried his ideological influence to an American audience in tones that echoed the Scot's fervently moral voice. Geddes's evolutionary categorization prompted Mumford in his prejudice against "megalop-<lb/>
olis," the city grown gargantuan or what we today call "Spread City." In adopting Geddes as his mentor, Mumford distanced himself from European modern-<lb/>
ism, promoting instead planning concepts derived from Howard and the village-inspired British new towns. On the whole, architects and planners in <name type="place">Amer-<lb/>
ica</name> aimed to give homeowners and tenants a more per-<lb/>
sonal experience of nature and a more community-focused environment than that provided by Le Corbusier's broad, geometric grid of super-<lb/>
blocks with regularly spaced, identical towers. Their site planning bore traces of both the Picturesque and Beaux-Arts styles in which they had been trained, although they eschewed Neoclassical architecture with its costly materials and ornament in favor of a simpler building vocabulary more suited to their aim of provid-<lb/>
ing affordable housing and functional communities.
<pb n="420"/>
<pb n="420" type="orig"/>
Thus, they usually employed brick with white trim and often evoked American Colonial vernacular forms in their neo-Georgian buildings and village greens.</p>
<p>In <date when="1922">1922</date>, Mumford met the Beaux-Arts-trained architect Clarence Stein (<date when="1882">1882</date>&#x2013;<date when="1975">1975</date>), who shared his ideal of planning according to Geddes's regional survey methods. With the moral and financial sup-<lb/>
port of developer Alexander Bing (<date when="1878">1878</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959">1959</date>), who added business sense to this agenda, they hoped to demonstrate the concept and means of providing bet-<lb/>
ter living conditions for a wider social range than had been possible previously. For Stein, this meant improved housing for modest-income families in environmentally sound communities in which schools, shops, and parks were within the easy walk-<lb/>
ing radii recommended by Perry.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Charles Harris Whitaker</name> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1938">1938</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the American Institute of Architects</hi> (JAIA),_???shared the Progressive Era reform agenda of these two men. He sought to expand the public con-<lb/>
cerns of architects beyond the City Beautiful move-<lb/>
ment toward a social-service orientation that addressed more fundamental needs than ennobling the urban landscape with monuments symbolizing civic pride. Benton MacKaye (<date when="1879">1879</date>&#x2013;<date when="1975">1975</date>), a trained forester, an environmentalist, and the father of the Appalachian Trail, reinforced the group's regional and conservationist perspectives. In <date when="1923">1923</date>, with a handful of others, they formed the Regional Planning Association of <name type="place">America</name> (RPAA).</p>
<p>A native of Shirley, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, MacKaye felt that the <name type="place">New England</name> town with its compact set-<lb/>
tlement around a village green and proximity to rural nature offered the best possible model for regional urbanism. He viewed with horror the side effects of the new automobile culture on the landscape, as tacky roadside stands, billboards, and filling stations sprang up along rural highways, blighting the natural scenery as well as graceful old towns. He conceived the creation of the "townless highway," his term for the limited-access throughway that bypassed urban centers and eliminated grade crossings with under-<lb/>
passes. New towns, too, would benefit from being constructed away from, yet in reasonable proximity to, this special-purpose artery. Further, the visionary MacKaye was a proponent of Giant Power, as he and other regionalists called their idea for transmitting electricity via high-voltage lines from coal- and water-powered stations located at mines and dams. He saw the Tennessee Valley Authority the New Deal program for damming the Tennessee River to harness hydroelectric power for distribution through-<lb/>
out the region, as an administrative model and means for channeling urban growth into discrete, park-sur-<lb/>
rounded cities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most effective contribution of the RPAA&#x2014;in addition to the body of literature Mum-<lb/>
ford produced&#x2014;was the demonstration of new prin-<lb/>
ciples for community planning by the City Housing Corporation. The socially motivated real-estate developer and RPAA member Alexander Bing set up this limited-dividend company in order to build Sun-<lb/>
nyside Gardens (<date when="1924">1924</date>) in the Borough of Queens, <name type="place">New York</name>, and Radburn (<date when="1928">1928</date>) in the Borough of Fairlawn, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>. In the absence of the govern-<lb/>
ment support that helped to underwrite later housing programs, the City Housing Corporation was a small, privately capitalized instrument designed to demonstrate the benefits of regional planning and the value of limited-dividend financing in returning a fixed profit to investors while also funding further community improvements.</p>
<p>However modest the scale of Sunnyside and Radburn, the entire RPAA fraternity applied assidu-<lb/>
ous attention and deep moral commitment to their design and building. Clarence Stein, planner and architect of these projects, collaborated with his part-<lb/>
ner, Henry Wright, as well as with Frederick Lee Ackerman, the architect of their houses. All three men were founding members of RPAA. Ackerman and Wright brought to bear their experience from Yorkship Village and other wartime emergency housing developments and with it their commitment to Clarence Perry's neighborhood unit as the funda-<lb/>
mental community building block. As editor and writer, Whitaker and Mumford broadcast the philos-<lb/>
ophy of regional planning pioneered at Sunnyside and Radburn. Further, Mumford and his family took up residence in Sunnyside Gardens, remaining there for eleven years. MacKaye bolstered the other RPAA members' belief in technology as a powerful tool for social improvement and strengthened their commit-<lb/>
ment to natural areas preservation.</p> 
<p>In <date when="1924">1924</date>, on property Bing purchased from the Long Island Railroad to the east of Forest Hills in Sun-<lb/>
nyside, Queens, Stein and Wright applied Perry's neighborhood-unit principles to the planning of Sunnyside Gardens. Ackerman served as architect for the blocks of houses, and Marjorie Sewell Cautley was hired as the project's landscape architect. Within the constraints of the preexisting grid, the design team developed a plan that maximized the amount of open space for private gardens, public greenery, and rec-<lb/>
reational commons, also providing an internal pedes-<lb/>
trian circulation system for each block (fig. 12.23). Thus, their plan abandoned private property lot lines in favor of row houses with small individual back-<lb/>
yards that faced a large communal parklike space where children could play. The Sunnyside commons were in time abandoned as land was sold to adjacent homeowners, who divided most of the once-shared
<pb n="421"/>
<pb n="421" type="orig"/>
landscape into individual parcels. But this early garden suburb was an important foundation for the work of Stein and Wright at Radburn, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, and for such later new towns as Reston, <name type="place">Virginia</name>.</p>

<p>Radburn, undertaken as a successor to Sunnyside Gardens, carried the garden-city concept forward. The community was billed as a New Town for the Motor Age. As Stein explained in <hi rend="italic">Toward New Towns for America</hi> (<date when="1957">1957</date>), "We believed thoroughly in green belts and towns of a limited size planned for work as well as living. We did not fully recognize that our main interest after our Sunnyside experience had been trans-<lb/>
ferred to a more pressing need, that of a town in which people could live peacefully with the automobile&#x2014;or rather in spite of it."<ref target="#CH12-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref>Traffic engineers soon became important professionals within the new fields of city planning and municipal administration.</p>
<p>The Radburn Idea was embodied in a layout that reduced the length of the roadway to the minimum necessary for automobile access, while providing abundant commonly held open space and a system of circulation routes modeled after the one developed by Olmsted and Vaux in Central Park (figs. 12.24, 12.25). To achieve this, Stein and Wright developed within the town's principal streets the super-block of 35 to 50 acres, a larger and more irregularly shaped area than that of a traditional city block. The savings associated with fewer linear feet of roadway made the provision of parkland cost-effective. Houses were turned so that their living rooms and bedrooms faced not the street but the green commons, which was continuous throughout the community.</p>
<p>Radburn was to have had a band of industrial development adjacent to the Erie Railroad lines and a new express highway. Then, in <date when="1929">1929</date>, when the first families moved into Radburn, the nation was plunged into the Great Depression. Industry did not materialize, and home buying and home building everywhere came to a halt. Banks foreclosed the mortgages of some Rad-<lb/>
burn residents, and only two superblocks were com-<lb/>
pleted. Still, Radburn as an idea lived on. In the United States it served as a direct model for the Greenbelt Towns (<name type="place">Greenbelt</name>, <name type="place">Maryland</name>; <name type="place">Greenhills</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>; and

<p>The idea of rational planning by a diversified consortium of professional disciplines represented by the most skilled technical experts became some-<lb/>
thing of an article of faith by the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, even in the democratic United States with its free-market econ-<lb/>
omy. The authoritarianism implicit in such planning was more acceptable than it would be today. The prevailing notion was that a new social order was being born and that modern technology in the ser-<lb/>
vice of democratic values could produce a more humane society and a higher standard of living for almost all classes. The United States was becoming a manufacturing titan, adding to its abundant natural resources unprecedented industrial wealth. Under these circumstances, people were optimistic that the solutions to social and physical problems could be found through financing and technical expertise, and they were willing to trust those in power to provide the benefits of modernity to society as a whole. The notion of an enlightened and beneficient mastermind arranging a total environment geared to the new working patterns and rising living standards of the times was an attractive one as people grappled with the rapid technological advances and complexity of modern society. In <name type="place">America</name> as well as in Europe, certain architects were beginning to think of them-<lb/>
selves as suited for this role, none more so than Frank Lloyd Wright, who well understood that the fundamental gift of the motor age was mobility.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian Vision for Broadacre City</hi></hi></head>
<p>The members of RPAA, Peter Kropotkin, and H. G. Wells had early intuited one of the most important aspects of modernity: ease of movement and the consequent liberation from being bound in place. Similarly, the architect Frank Lloyd Wright (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2014; <date when="1959">1959</date>) saw decentralization as a positive force for improving the human condition. Unlike the RPAA group or the builders in the newly created Soviet Union, Wright did not promote a communal vision but one that celebrated individual freedom in the tra-<lb/>
dition of the transcendentalists Ralph Waldo Emer-<lb/>
son, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman. He saw how mass automobile ownership, widespread communications enabled by radio, telegraph, and telephone, and easily distributed electric power could make possi-<lb/>
ble a complete redistribution of population. At least in <name type="place">America</name> with its abundance of developable land, it was now theoretically possible for people to live at very low densities, with each family occupying an entire acre. Wright also saw how standardization of industrial production creat-<lb/>
ing inexpensive new building technologies and util-<lb/>
ities construction could foster large-scale, low-density urbanization. According to his Usonian Vision, as he called his utopian scheme for Broada-<lb/>
cre City, instead of living in a hive of nearly identical apartments or garden-city row houses, residents would occupy distinctive freestanding houses. Wright's anti-urban utopia was thus completely unlike that of Le Corbusier or the planners of Rad-<lb/>
burn except in its willing embrace of great systems of conveyance&#x2014;distribution lines for power and utilities and transportation corridors for the move-<lb/>
ment of people and goods.</p>
<p>Publication of Wright's scheme for Broadacre City probably furthered his reputation as an architec-<lb/>
tural genius, but his proposal had little chance of being realized. In the United States, perhaps more than in other countries, the kind of civic leadership and initiative Tocqueville had observed a century earlier defied authoritarian visions and singular solu-<lb/>
tions. Planning, particularly on a regional scale, to be successful, necessitated close cooperation between the public and private sectors, and men such as Lewis Mumford and Frank Lloyd Wright were not temperamentally equipped to struggle and compro-<lb/>
 
mise within the political arena in order to advance a
<pb n="423"/>
<pb n="423" type="orig"/>
partial agenda. Nor were they willing to forsake an ideal premised upon low-density settlement in garden cities or on broad acres for one that served merely to guide the already forceful trend toward metropolitan-<lb/>
ism. Nowhere in the <date when="1920">1920</date>s and <date when="1930">1930</date>s were the impli-<lb/>

</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">The Regional Plan for New York</hi></hi></head>
<p>In contrast to Mumford and his fellow members of the Regional Planning Association of <name type="place">America</name>, the Regional Plan Association (RPA) proposed no radical agenda of garden-city decentralization. This group instead undertook the preparation of a plan to <hi rend="italic">guide</hi> the growth of metropoli-<lb/>
tan <name type="place">New York</name> City, which was rapidly spawning suburban development in several counties of the tri-state (<name type="place">New York</name>, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, and Connecticut) region surrounding the five boroughs that constitute the incorporated city. Unlike the RPAA garden-city idealists who wished to retard metropolitan growth and foster discrete urban communities set well apart and separated by open space, the founders of the RPA recognized the momentum for cities to grow into massive regional complexes.<ref target="#CH12-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref> Planning, in their view, was essential to predict statistically, then guide rationally, not rearrange, this growth. Underly-<lb/>
ing the new urban scale they envisioned was a con-<lb/>
stant increase in automobile ownership, opening up the possibility of ever-expanding rings of residential settlement and the birth of the commuter society. Their metropolitan vision also implied increased density at the urban core with office skyscrapers thrusting ever higher into the air.</p>
<p>The Regional Plan Association, though not yet known by that name, had its beginning in <date when="1921">1921</date>. That year <name type="pname">Charles Dyer Norton</name> (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x2013;<date when="1923">1923</date>), a trustee of the Russell Sage Foundation, the philanthropic fund that had sponsored Forest Hills Gardens, helped initi-<lb/>

minded. They addressed some of the same social issues, and RPA welcomed RPAA's Radburn Plan and other similarly innovative planning approaches, including the creation of the motor parkways that made MacKaye's vision of the "townless highway" a reality. But Norton was part of a business and philan-<lb/>
thropic elite that maintained, when possible, a close working relationship with government. Understand-<lb/>
ably, RPA pragmatically focused on the physical, eco-<lb/>
nomic, social, and legal surveys that would guide political and corporate decision makers and help direct existing market forces toward coherent, rational ends. Accepting as natural and inevitable the enlargement of the metropolis beyond the boundaries of the five-borough polity of Greater <name type="place">New York</name> that had been created in <date when="1898">1898</date>, RPA hoped to transform the city and its several surrounding counties into a better planned multigovernmental regional entity.</p>
<p>Although British garden-city planner Thomas Adams brought his professional experience in <name type="place">England</name> to the Regional Plan Committee, the precur-<lb/>
sor of RPA, <name type="place">New York</name> City's course of metropolitan regional growth was already set. Its destiny was to remain that of a commercial and entertainment core with vertically expanding skyscrapers and horizon-<lb/>
tally extending rings of commuter suburbs, none true garden cities. Unwin's Hampstead Gardens, which Norton had praised as "the best subdivision of subur-<lb/>
ban land ever I saw or heard of,"<ref target="#CH12-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref>was a leafy dormi-<lb/>
tory within the <name type="place">London</name> metropolis, and it, rather than Letchworth, served as a paradigm for <name type="place">New York</name>'s expansion. Adams must have realized that the com-<lb/>
plexity and size of <name type="place">New York</name> City and its environs, as well as the region's political fragmentation, militated against a British reformist approach to planning. In the United States, growth might be guided by infra-<lb/>
structure improvements and the reservation of certain lands for public use, but it would be practically impos-<lb/>
sible to mandate and locate new town construction within the context of a free-market real-estate econ-<lb/>
omy.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Thomas Adams</name> and <name type="pname">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, Jr., a principal consultant on the plan, proposed that the task be addressed by individual team members taking responsibility for different geographical areas. Adams was chosen to chair and coordinate the activities of this Advisory Group as they tackled in their regional sec-<lb/>
tors problems of land use and population density; sub-<lb/>
division, land development, and housing; circulation and communication; and open spaces and recreation. Informing their inquiry was the work of the directors of the Economic, Legal, and Social Surveys. Olmsted was responsible for the important sector comprising all of beach-rich Long Island, and Adams made Westches-<lb/>
ter and Fairfield Counties his purview.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Adams</name> tried to synthesize the many studies, a task made difficult by the application of each man's independent approach and individual set of planning values to his particular sector. Altogether, however, their reports set forth the need for regional zoning, including agricultural zoning; for circumferential roads rather than more radial transportation corridors; for centralization of some activities and decentralization of others according to their functional requirements; for increased parkland, especially along the waterfront; and for reservation of land for airport sites.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this point, four committees of architects set to work sketching plans for various Manhattan projects, ranging in style from Beaux-Arts Neoclassicism to a visionary modernism emphasizing technology and move-<lb/>
ment (fig. 12.26). The drawings of <name type="pname">Hugh Ferriss</name> (<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x2013;<date when="1962">1962</date>) and <name type="pname">Harvey Wiley Corbett</name> (<date when="1873">1873</date>&#x2013;<date when="1954">1954</date>) made especially clear that, far from withering away as the city became more decentralized, the Manhattan core would become aggrandized as a transportation hub and commercial center.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the planners studied traffic and transportation issues separately, and they therefore never achieved an integrated approach to the move-<lb/>
ment of people and goods by both highway and rail. Their proposals to integrate suburban rail and urban transit services also foundered because of political, administrative, and technical problems. Governmental fragmentation made it difficult to favor one jurisdic-<lb/>
tion over another. Private ownership of rail lines cre-<lb/>
ated rivalry for tax revenues and profits, rendering impossible any serious cooperation between compa-<lb/>
nies. Furthermore, city transit officials refused to plan on an interstate regional basis. For these reasons, Adams oriented the Regional Plan toward the newer technology represented by the motor vehicle. It was simply easier to concentrate on building new highways to serve the anticipated growth in commuters and goods. Travel by automobile was also by now a form of recreation, as installment-plan financing made cars available to people of average means. Recreational parkways were therefore an important part of the Regional Plan. Here Adams followed a trend Olmsted, Sr., had begun and Olmsted, Jr., had followed in his work for the <name type="place">New York</name> City Improvement Commis-<lb/>
sion in <date when="1907">1907</date> when he proposed limited-access, land-<lb/>
scaped parkways linking the city's larger parks.</p>
<p>In <date when="1929">1929</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Graphic Regional Plan</hi> was pub-<lb/>
lished and presented to public officials with consider-<lb/>
able fanfare. A document of overlays synthesizing several proposals, it was nevertheless without a unitary vision, clear objectives, or a set of strategies for imple-<lb/>
mentation. To work toward the realization of the plan's carefully balanced and essentially pragmatic proposals, the Committee of the Regional Plan was reconstituted as the Regional Plan Association. With RPA's official birth as a permanent advocacy organization, the group now focused on publishing the eight volumes making up the Regional Survey and <hi rend="italic">The Building of the City</hi> (<date when="1931">1931</date>), Adams's companion volume to the <hi rend="italic">Graphic Regional Plan.</hi> It also worked to build broad regional support among civic leaders and elected officials.</p>
<p>In spite of harsh criticism from Mumford and other members of RPAA who harbored as their ideal a less market-oriented and less politically circumspect plan&#x2014; one embodying their utopian vision of commu-<lb/>
nity at the scale of the town&#x2014;and even though the organization was merely advisory and not legally con-<lb/>
stituted as a public authority with broad jurisdictional powers, the work of the RPA was influential. By <date when="1933">1933</date>, the RPAA had disbanded; it had only been a loose con-<lb/>
sortium of like-minded visionaries unsupported by financial resources to staff a professional planning effort. But the RPA stayed in existence because its pro-<lb/>
posals were attuned to political circumstances and compatible with general market trends. The work of Adams and his colleagues lived on in the form of the official recognition of city planning as a profession. Harvard Univer-<lb/>
sity expanded its landscape architecture department to include studies in this area and began offering a master's degree in planning in <date when="1928">1928</date>; the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Institute of Technology, Cornell University, and Columbia University established similar programs in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s. In addition, in <date when="1936">1936</date>, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia created the <name type="place">New York</name> City Planning Com-<lb/>
mission, and by <date when="1937">1937</date>, 139 municipal planning boards had been established and 308 zoning ordinances adopted in the <name type="place">New York</name> Region.</p>

<p>The greatest physical result of the <date when="1929">1929</date> Regional Plan was the creation of numerous state parks and regional parkways in <name type="place">New York</name> and other states throughout the nation. Beginning in <date when="1933">1933</date>, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt stimulated park and parkway building through the National Planning Board and federal pub-<lb/>
lic works programs. In making their recommendations for new regional parks and parkways in the <name type="place">New York</name> Region, the RPA planners were in fact following a trend already in progress, giving it voice and rational
<pb n="425"/>
<pb n="425" type="orig"/>
shape through their studies.</p>
<p>As an outgrowth of Olmsted's <date when="1907">1907</date> report, the Bronx River Parkway, built between <date when="1912">1912</date> and <date when="1923">1923</date>, had become America's first grade-separated highway. Unlike the intra-urban, boulevard-style parkways designed by Olmsted, Sr., and Vaux to provide a green framework for residential growth and to link several major parks within a city, the Bronx River Parkway was regional, rather than municipal in scale. More than a ribbon of tree-lined roadway with numer-<lb/>
ous intersections, it was planned as a landscape, an uninterrupted stretch of park scenery with widely spaced entrance points. The park-making motive was, in fact, initially paramount, and the road was the result of a secondary impulse. Only after the commis-<lb/>
sioners in charge of the project had launched it as an effort to clean the waters and beautify the banks of the Bronx River, as it flowed from the Kensico Dam in West-chester County to enter Bronx Park, did they decide that it should contain a roadway. The land-<lb/>
scape architect, <name type="pname">Hermann W. Merkel</name>, and the princi-<lb/>
pal engineer, <name type="pname">Leslie G. Holleran</name>, designed it for pleasure driving to various regional park destinations and to provide a dignified entrance into <name type="place">New York</name> City from the north (fig. 12.27). They divided the roadway with a median of irregular width that accom-<lb/>
modated grade changes and such topographical fea-<lb/>
tures as rock outcrops and particularly fine stands of trees. Construction, stopped during World War I, resumed after <date when="1919">1919</date>, by which time more powerful automobile engines made greater speeds possible. This explains why the radii of the parkway's curves, designed for the pace of a carriage in its southern por-<lb/>
tion, become elongated as the road progresses north-<lb/>
ward. An ample right-of-way containing an entire "viewshed," its densely planted borders varying in width from 190 to 1,000 feet (57.9 to 304.8 meters), discouraged the erection of billboards at a time when there was no legislation banning them from adjacent properties. Landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke (<date when="1892">1892</date>&#x2013;<date when="1982">1982</date>) designed the individually distinctive bridge overpasses of rough-finished fieldstone.</p>
<p>So successful was this project as a work of land-<lb/>
scape design and as a stimulant to nearby property values and taxes, that even before its completion a Westchester County Park Commission was set up in <date when="1922">1922</date>. Its technical staff included Clarke and the engi-<lb/>
neer Jay Downer, who had also worked on the Bronx River Parkway. Over the next ten years these men collaborated on the construction of more than a dozen parks and several new parkways including the Saw Mill River and the Hutchinson River Parkways. In Putnam County, the Taconic State Park Commission was responsible for the extraordinarily inventive and beautiful Taconic State Parkway sweeping northward into Dutchess and Columbia Counties (fig. 12.28).</p>

<p>Although frequently dismissive of the work of Adams and his colleagues, <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name> (<date when="1888">1888</date>&#x2014; <date when="1981">1981</date>) became responsible, more than any other individual, agency, or municipality, for transforming <name type="place">New York</name> City into a regional entity by means of a 416-<lb/>

dle class for increased recreation facilities. Ruthless in the way he maneuvered his way to success, when it suited his ends, <name type="pname">Moses</name> co-opted the planning exper-<lb/>
tise of the Regional Plan Committee (later the Regional Plan Association). Many of the parkways and the related parks that <name type="pname">Moses</name> built were outlined in the Regional Plan. Nevertheless, he could also por-<lb/>
tray the group as protective of elitist class interests. Brooking no opposition, he amassed sufficient power to become a force equal to the elected officials whom he served, dominating government bureaucracies and often bending to his will business leaders, including the sponsors of the Regional Plan.</p>
<p>In <date when="1924">1924</date>, <name type="pname">Governor Alfred E. Smith</name> appointed <name type="pname">Moses</name> chairman of the Long Island Park Commission and chairman of the <name type="place">New York</name> State Council of Parks.

<pb n="426"/>
<pb n="426" type="orig"/>
solidating individual borough park administrations into a centralized citywide agency. <name type="pname">Jones Beach</name>, a palatial bathing and recreational complex built during the <date when="1920">1920</date>s on Long Island's Great South Bay, is per-<lb/>
haps his most important landscape design achieve-<lb/>
ment (fig. 12.29). Completed in <date when="1929">1929</date>, the 2,245-acre oceanfront park had a 1-mile-long boardwalk, a 14-mile-long boat channel, archery ranges, an 18-hole golf course, pony tracks, bathhouses, wading and swimming pools, lawns, shrubbery, and sixty-four parking lots accommodating 12,000 automobiles. <name type="pname">Moses</name> thought of Jones Beach as an American Lido, a deluxe middle-class family resort, intentionally devoid of the honky-tonk concessions found at such beachside amusement parks as Coney Island. Here he converted a necessity into an icon, adopting Harvey Wiley Corbett's idea of turning the 200-foot (70-<lb/>
meter) water tower for pumping fresh water from 1,200 feet (366 meters) below sea level into a stream-<lb/>
lined imitation of the campanile of Saint Mark's in <name type="place">Venice</name>. Rising from the middle of a lavishly land-<lb/>
scaped traffic circle containing reflecting pools with floral borders at the far end of the causeway linking the barrier beach with the mainland, this architectural beacon, washed by floodlights at night, could be seen from a distance of 25 miles away.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Moses</name> was indifferent to the interests of the wealthy men who owned large estates and belonged to hunt clubs and country clubs. With the creation of numerous public parks, he substituted middle-class recreational ideals for the upper-class ones that had governed land use and shaped landscape design in the past. Not surprisingly, Jones Beach was an instant and huge public success. By <date when="1936">1936</date>, <name type="pname">Moses</name> had built 100 miles of parkways on Long Island and in <name type="place">New York</name> City, and by the end of the decade he had created 255 new city playgrounds, added several miles of urban beaches, given Central Park a major facelift, and ren-<lb/>
ovated several other historic parks.</p>
<p>But <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name> did not single-handedly bring the modern park and recreation era into being in <name type="place">New York</name> State. Since the turn of the twentieth century, the old elite had made the general public the beneficiary of several enlightened philanthropic actions. <name type="pname">J. Pier-<lb/>
pont Morgan</name> had saved the Palisades across the Hud-<lb/>
son River from <name type="place">New York</name> City from traprock mining, and in <date when="1910">1910</date> the Harriman family gave the state more than 40,000 additional acres along the Hudson River, a gift that included Bear Mountain State Park. Wil-<lb/>
liam Letchworth donated his <date when="1000">1000</date>-acre tract along the scenic Genesee River in western <name type="place">New York</name> State, and the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society successfully campaigned to have the state acquire the geologically fascinating Watkins Glen at the southern end of Seneca Lake.</p>
<p>While there was a great deal of sporadic action in other states at this time, only <name type="place">New York</name>, Connecti-<lb/>
cut, Wisconsin, <name type="place">California</name>, and Indiana had anything like an organized approach to acquiring and manag-<lb/>
ing state parks. Nowhere was there a system of state parks until, in <date when="1921">1921</date>, Stephen Mather, the director of the National Park Service, saw the need to protect the national parks from being overrun by automobile tourists. He sought to provide recreational opportuni-<lb/>
ties in less spectacular settings closer to urban centers and set to work organizing the National Conference on State Parks. His efforts resulted in the creation of seventeen state park boards or commissions between <date when="1921">1921</date> and <date when="1927">1927</date>.</p>
<p>During the Great Depression, the Civilian Con-<lb/>
servation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) provided vast numbers of workers to build parks and parkways all over the country. Building upon principles embodied in the National Park plan authored by Frederick Law Olm-<lb/>
sted, Jr., in <date when="1916">1916</date>, the National Park Service assumed increasing design responsibility, particularly after the Park, Parkway, and Recreational Study Act of <date when="1936">1936</date> authorized federal involvement in metropolitan and state park planning. Its own aesthetic, Government Rustic&#x2014;an unpretentious style intended to harmo-<lb/>
nize with nature and to express an American pioneer ethos through the use of rough-hewn timbers, hatch-<lb/>
et-cut stone, or boulders&#x2014;offered an alternative to the stripped-down Beaux-Arts classicism character-<lb/>
istic of much park building design of the period (fig. 12.30).</p>
<p>By the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, even where there were no park-<lb/>
ways or state parks to serve them, Americans were taking to the road in increasing numbers.<ref target="#CH12-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref>Com-<lb/>

the stars as their frontier forebears had done. They gave their Ford Model Ts names like Lizzie or Belle, and they identified these wonderful machines with the adventurous and leisurely stage coach. They called their style of travel "gypsying" and enjoyed the serendipitous companionship of fellow motorists with whom they formed an instantaneous fraternity as they passed on directions and assisted one another with mechanical and roadbed repairs. These hardy souls were the first to adopt the slogan "See <name type="place">America</name> First" when World War I made European travel impossible. Even after the war, cultural chauvinism and pride in America's scenery promoted this new form of vacation, and the growing popularity of auto-<lb/>
mobile touring increased the demand for national and state parks. As more and more Americans took to the road, it became necessary to set up municipal camp-<lb/>
sites. Soon entrepreneurs built roadside cabins to pro-<lb/>
vide campers with basic amenities, and from this humble beginning, the motel industry was born.</p>
<p>The new regional mobility spelled the end of the Olmstedian ideal of the park as a pastoral refuge in the heart of the city as people with automobiles increasingly sought their bucolic pleasures in excur-<lb/>
sions to the new county and state parks, enjoying the drive there on landscaped parkways. Veblen's defini-<lb/>
tion of the leisure class had been extended to a broad social spectrum, and <hi rend="italic">leisure</hi> as a term was gaining common currency. Ball fields, golf courses, swim-<lb/>
ming pools, ice-skating rinks, bathing beaches, tennis courts, riding stables, and archery ranges assumed the status of public entitlements, accoutrements of the American way of life. This was the logical outcome of the movement that from the beginning of the twen-<lb/>
tieth century had placed playgrounds, along with housing, at the forefront of the social reformers' agenda.</p>
<p>Accurately reading the temper of the times, <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name> had a parks vision to match society's appetite for play. For him, transportation planning and park planning went hand in hand. During his thir-<lb/>
ty-year tenure as commissioner of the <name type="place">New York</name> City Department of Parks and Recreation, he converted carriage drives into wider roadways for automobiles, turned meadows into ball fields, and built play-<lb/>
grounds and other recreational facilities.<ref target="#CH12-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref>Auda-<lb/>
ciously, he claimed that the nearly 3,000 acres of parkways and other transportation corridors he com-<lb/>
missioned in <name type="place">New York</name> City were really linear parks because of the addition of marginal playgrounds, foot and bicycle paths, and waterfront promenades within their rights-of-way. <name type="pname">Moses</name>' position as commissioner of parks, together with his chairmanship of the Long Island State Park Commission and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, allowed him to reshape the <name type="place">New York</name> metropolitan region according to an ethos of mass leisure.</p>

<p>As the urban sociologist and American parks histo-<lb/>
rian Galen Cranz points out in <hi rend="italic">The Politics of Park Design,</hi> the factory system of industrial efficiency and Reform Era play, with its emphasis on physical exercise and sports, were contemporary phenomena, and both were organized in a highly regimented way.<ref target="#CH12-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref>Thus, increased recreational opportunities afforded by the shorter workweek, longer vacations, earlier retirement, and higher pay went hand in hand with highly structured play environments that were, ironically, as pragmatically focused and utilitarian as industrial factories&#x2014;implicitly acknowledged as the dominant paradigm for the organization of modern life. Thanks to the efforts of early-twentieth-century reformers, the profession of recreational leader had been created. In the sphere of park administration as elsewhere, the basis for social reform shifted from reliance on sheer moral fervor and presumed class superiority to dependence on technical expertise and professional skill. Park departments hired recruits of upright character and instituted training programs for directors of playgrounds, as those parks emphasizing recreational activities were now called.</p>
<p><name type="place">Chicago</name> was the standard-bearer in the creation of Progressive Era playgrounds or neighborhood parks. Along with the branch library, the field house was an original <name type="place">Chicago</name> recreational institution that also served as a neighborhood cultural and educa-<lb/>
tional center. Social reformers saw it as an important instrument of civic improvement, and they vigorously sponsored the construction of both libraries and field houses in the city's poorest sections.</p>
<p>In <name type="place">Chicago</name>'s West Park District, where some of the city's least affluent residents lived, Jens Jensen (<date when="1860">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1951">1951</date>), a Danish immigrant, served as chief landscape architect and general superintendent. Because of his agrarian background and education in Danish folk schools where teachers emphasized indigenous culture, Jensen had a natural sympathy for
<pb n="428"/>
<pb n="428" type="orig"/>
native scenery and local cultural mores. He deeply loved the <name type="place">Illinois</name> prairie as an especially beautiful landscape. In his own work he developed plans that evoked prairie rivers and produced what he called "sun openings," small glades to serve as miniature prairies within parks. Although he integrated such geometrical elements as circular rose gardens into his park plans, and although in keeping with contempo-<lb/>
rary demand his meadows were designed for ball playing, golf, and tennis, Jensen subscribed to Olm-<lb/>
sted's quintessentially American vision of landscape creation with its implicit transcendentalist objective of bringing city people into closer contact with nature. He employed some of the same design strategies as Olmsted &#x2014; creating long views in which loosely arranged clumps of trees allow the eye to be beckoned from one landscape space to another, building large irregular lakes or lagoons, looping park interiors with circuit drives, and concealing park borders with densely planted vegetation (fig. 12.31).</p>

</figure>
<p><name type="pname">Jensen</name> also subscribed to the goals of the Regional Planning Association of <name type="place">America</name> and adhered to the social reform ideas of <name type="pname">Jane Addams</name>. Inspired by Addams's use of pageantry as a means of fostering ethnic pride and inculcating democratic val-<lb/>
ues, he borrowed this idea to promote conservation and spiritual bonds with nature. Anticipating the the-<lb/>
ories of Ian <name type="pname">McHarg</name> (<date when="1920">1920</date>&#x2013;<date when="2001">2001</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Design with Nature</hi> (<date when="1969">1969</date>), he ardently promoted a naturalis-<lb/>
tic style of landscape design at a time when Beaux-<lb/>
Arts formality enjoyed favor nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>Although Jensen's refusal to accommodate the political machine that controlled park operational pol-<lb/>
icy cost him this position in <date when="1900">1900</date>, he continued to serve the Special Park Commission that had been established to develop plans for a metropolitan park system similar to the one Charles Eliot had envisioned for <name type="place">Boston</name> (see Chapter Nine). Brought back into office as the head of the West Park District in <date when="1905">1905</date> by a reform administration, Jensen prepared new plans for Douglas, Garfield, and other partially built parks. In Garfield Park, he built what was then the world's largest conservatory, installing a naturalistic brook with water threading its way musically from one fern-embowered rocky ledge to another.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Jensen</name> also designed the new small parks of the West Park District, all of which were under 8.5 acres in size, in a more informal manner than those of the South Park District. In the same vein, he urged Wil-<lb/>
liam Carbys Zimmerman, the state architect and designer of the West Park District field houses, to consider the <name type="place">Chicago</name> Prairie style that Wright and other architects were then developing as an expres-<lb/>
sion compatible with the regional landscape. The Prairie style in architecture is characterized by broad, low, ground-hugging planes; a forthright expression of structure; and respect for native building materials.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Jensen</name>'s later work was often paired in exhibi-<lb/>
tions with that of such Prairie-style architects as George Grant Elmslie, William Purcell, and Wright, as well as with that of another likeminded landscape architect, Ossian Cole Simonds, who also favored open, naturalistic designs employing native plants. Along with Simonds, Jensen felt that the relatively featureless landscape of the Midwest held a particular subtle beauty. Its flatness was for him something to be celebrated, which he did with shelving planes of rocks beside winding stream courses and the horizontal branching patterns of hawthorns and crab apples (see fig. 12.33). He imitated natural plant communities in his choice and placement of these and other native species, and he sometimes attempted to achieve the appearance of plant succession, the sequential coloni-<lb/>
zation by different species of a particular region until
<pb n="429"/>
<pb n="429" type="orig"/>
the species first there have given way to the region's natural climax situation, or ecological maturity. He also gave attention to effects of natural light, creating sun openings framed by groves of trees and planting in a way that made one's passage along gently wind-<lb/>
ing roads an experience of alternating light and shade.</p>
<p>In <date when="1916">1916</date>, near the city's western boundary and the town of Oak Park, Jensen designed Columbus Park, a square parcel comprising 144 acres. Charac-<lb/>
terized by his friend and follower Alfred Caldwell as "the finest and most complete of all the Jensen parks,"<ref target="#CH12-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref>it epitomized his original contribution toward developing a Prairie style in landscape archi-<lb/>
tecture while still incorporating facilities for popular forms of recreation (fig. 12.32). Tennis courts, swim-<lb/>
ming pool, playground, and an athletic field are located between the park periphery and the interior circuit drive. Inside the drive is a large meadow&#x2014;the prairie in miniature&#x2014;designed to also serve as a golf course. Curving around its eastern edge is a lagoon, created when Jensen deepened a small watercourse, turning it into a "prairie river," which he bordered with wetland vegetation: irises, rose mallow, cordgrass, cattails, rushes, arrowheads, and water lil-<lb/>
ies. Around the source of this waterbody Jensen, who prided himself on his rockwork compositions, laid several irregular, horizontal layers of native limestone to give the appearance of a low, stratified prairie bluff (fig. 12.33). On a small hill near the lagoon, Jensen created a players' green&#x2014;a clearing designed to serve as a performance area&#x2014;orienting the position of the audience, who sat in the grass on the opposite side of one of the two brooks flowing into the lagoon, west toward the setting sun.</p>
<p>An admirer of the remaining traces of Native American occupancy in the natural landscape, Jensen used the Indian trail as inspiration in the design of his paths. He used rough-cut stone to build council rings, circular stone benches with a fire pit in the center. Council rings were gathering places where park visi-<lb/>
tors could converse, listen to stories, or participate in pageants. Players' greens&#x2014;clearings designed to serve as settings for performances in nature&#x2014;served a similar purpose.</p>
<p>In <date when="1935">1935</date>, Jensen designed the Lincoln Memorial Garden in Springfield, <name type="place">Illinois</name>. Here, on a gently slop-<lb/>
ing and undulating site that he helped select on the shore of Lake Springfield, he contrasted densely planted copses of native species&#x2014;redbud, dogwood, hawthorn, crab apple, maple, cherry, sumac, birch, oak, ash, and locust&#x2014;with open greens and broad grassy lanes leading to the water's edge in several places. In addition, he built eight council rings (four-<lb/>
teen were originally planned), including the Lincoln Council Ring set within a grove of white oaks over-<lb/>
looking the lake. Volunteers, especially schoolchil-<lb/>
dren and garden club members, were instrumental in collecting native plants not available in nurseries and in carrying out the details of Jensen's plan.</p>

Landscape, an early conservation group that led a cit-<lb/>

<p>After the death of his wife in <date when="1934">1934</date>, Jensen decided to leave <name type="place">Chicago</name> to realize his cherished dream of founding a school similar to the Danish folk and agricultural schools of his youth. Its mission was to promote civic responsibility and environmental stewardship. At Ellison Bay, Wisconsin, where he had a vacation cabin, he established The Clearing, a non-degree-granting school in nature where students learn ecology and basic horticultural and land-<lb/>
scape-design practices. Because he believed in a humanistic approach to education, his curriculum also included drawing, painting, sculpture, music, drama, poetry, and architecture.</p>

<p>Increasingly, park designers were, as <name type="pname">Jensen</name> had been, employees of park agencies, rather than outside firms. But few held the Olmstedian ideals that Jensen did, and charged with retrofitting older parks with new facilities&#x2014;notably ball fields and children's playgrounds&#x2014;they displayed little of his sensitivity in harmonizing utilitarian and natural landscape ele-<lb/>
ments. Once-broad park vistas were interrupted with fencing to restrain errant baseballs, protect the young, and serve as a barrier to intruding dogs. With the increased social emphasis on sports, playing fields rather than meadows, recreation facilities rather than views, and active rather than passive use became ever greater public priorities.</p>
<p>The multiplication of parks and recreational ser-<lb/>
vices in an effort to keep up with market forces in the manner of a commercial enterprise led "to an increased emphasis on the efficiency with which [park departments] could deliver services on demand, and this emphasis led to systems thinking and bureau-<lb/>
cratization."<ref target="#CH12-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref>Greatly expanded in their scale of operations and no longer with any real sense of moral purpose, only efficient service delivery, as their raison d'&#x00EA;tre, parks agencies in <name type="place">New York</name> and elsewhere fell behind in the budgetary competition with other city agencies, failing to attain sufficient funding to ensure necessary maintenance and programming. Working at a system scale rather than an individual park scale, agency designers sought economy through standard-<lb/>
ization, thereby making municipal parks conven-<lb/>
tional and stereotypical in appearance as they minimized shrub plantings and other costly horticul-<lb/>
tural aspects of parks, paved paths with asphalt, and replaced grass with more apshalt in order to accom-<lb/>
modate basketball, handball, shuffleboard, and other types of hard-surface, equipment-based recreation. Fences and regulatory signs proliferated as managers with constrained budgets substituted these for on-site supervision. It was no longer acceptable for parks to be merely tranquil; they had to be entertaining as well.</p>
<p>Landscape as entertainment had already been demonstrated at the several world's fairs that had taken place since the middle of the nineteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. Perhaps no other fair captured people's futuristic imagination or nourished their consumeristic hunger for the fruits of technology so successfully as the <date when="1939">1939</date> World's Fair in <name type="place">New York</name> City. As with other earlier fairs, the sponsors of this one intended to leave behind a permanent park after its temporary struc-<lb/>
tures and exhibitions had been dismantled. But now landscape design and the world's fair were merging in another way. More than a showcase of many cul-<lb/>
tures and new developments in industrial science and technology, this fair was billed as a visionary preview of the coming attractions of modern urbanism. It was called the World of Tomorrow.</p>

<p>The <date when="1939">1939</date> World's Fair held at <name type="place">New York</name> City's Flushing Meadow&#x2013;Corona Park presented Depres-<lb/>
sion-ridden Americans with a consumerist vision of a future in which many electric gadgets and labor-sav-<lb/>
ing household appliances would become common-<lb/>
place. Moreover, there would be nearly universal automobile ownership, fast commuter highways, and single-family homes in leafy suburbs. Fairgoers thrilled to the possibilities of technological modernity as symbolically portrayed by Harrison &amp; Fouilhoux's highly visible all-white Theme Center composed of the 610-foot-high (190-meter-high) Trylon and 180-foot-diameter (55-meter-diameter) Perisphere, embraced by the Helicline, a gently sloping, curving ramp almost a 1,000 feet (305 meters) long (fig. 12.34).<ref target="#CH12-n24"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">24</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p><name type="pname">George McAneny</name>, head of the Regional Plan Association, Grover Whelan, business leader and for-<lb/>
mer police commissioner, and Percy Straus, chief executive of Macy's department store, were the prin-<lb/>
cipal sponsors of the <date when="1939">1939</date> fair. They saw it as a means of stimulating the economy and promoting <name type="place">New York</name>'s leadership as a commercial capital. Parks Commissioner <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name> saw visitors' need to come to it by automobile as well as by subway as an opportunity to further his agenda of parkway build-<lb/>
ing. He also saw the fair as a means of turning the destroyed Flushing Meadow salt marsh&#x2014;described
<pb n="431"/>
<pb n="431" type="orig"/>
by <name type="pname">F. Scott Fitzgerald</name> in <hi rend="italic">The Great Gatsby</hi> as the "Valley of Ashes," a cindery wasteland where the city dumped its garbage&#x2014;into "the Versailles of Amer-<lb/>
ica" after the fair was over. He hired <name type="pname">Gilmore D. Clarke</name> to design the park in advance of the fair and then fit the fair's building program to its outlines.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Moses</name> never fully realized his original dream of Versailles-in-Queens because World War II postponed the construction of parks and other public improve-<lb/>
ments. Estimated profits earmarked for the undertak-<lb/>
ing failed to materialize by the time a second fair on the same site, the World's Fair of <date when="1964">1964</date>, closed in <date when="1965">1965</date>. But the <name type="place">New York</name> City Parks Department did build a park, minus some of its intended grandeur, within the retained footprint of the two fairs. Within its boundar-<lb/>
ies, a new science museum, botanical garden, zoo, ice-skating rink, boating lake, art museum, outdoor concert bowl, sports stadium, and several works of sculpture&#x2014;all legacies from the two world's fairs&#x2014; enriched the Borough of Queens. In design terms, the park bears the stamp of the <name type="pname">Moses</name> era when Beaux-<lb/>
Arts-trained landscape architects such as Clarke grap-<lb/>
pled with the influence of modernism, producing the type of stripped-down Neoclassical layout that still prevails in many of <name type="place">New York</name> City's parks.</p>
<p>But it was not the design of the fairgrounds or the modernism of the architecture that created the almost breathless wonder that some people still remember experiencing at the <date when="1939">1939</date> fair. It was the exhibits. Visitors ascending the Helicline and entering the Perisphere found themselves to be giants over-<lb/>
looking a miniaturized 11,000-square-mile planned metropolis for 1.5 million people. Called Demo-<lb/>
cra-city and created by industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss with Wright's Broadacre City in mind, it segregated residential, commercial, and industrial activities into sectors linked by expressways. Here the commuters of the future saw satellite suburbs sur-<lb/>
rounding Centerton, the business, educational, and cultural hub of Democracity. Some of these suburbs were called Millvilles because, in the tradition of the garden-city movement, they were intended to contain sites for industry. Others, called Pleasantvilles, were purely residential and prefigured the suburbs that would blanket the agricultural fields of Long Island and other parts of the country after World War II.</p>

</figure>
<p>An even more exciting exhibit at the fair was Norman Bel Geddes's Futurama housed in the Gen-<lb/>
eral Motors Pavilion. Here was a 35,700-square-foot (3,320-square-meter) model of <name type="place">America</name> in <date when="1960">1960</date>, a technologically marvelous place crossed by sev-<lb/>
en-lane, continental-scale highways upon which low-<lb/>
cost, air-conditioned, diesel-powered, teardrop-shaped automobiles traveled at speeds up to 100 miles per hour. In a manner that suggested Frank Lloyd Wright and the metropolitan decentralists, there were self-suf-<lb/>
ficient farming and industrial communities. There were large cities, too, and these had tall skyscrapers set in an expanse of low-rise buildings with roof gar-<lb/>
dens. With its separate pedestrian and vehicular cir-<lb/>
culation systems, this was an urban scheme that Le Corbusier would have admired. Vast acres of nature
<pb n="432"/>
<pb n="432" type="orig"/>
were set aside in federally protected areas, and there were dams and mines built according to advanced engineering technology. The visitor to Futurama viewed this model of the imaginary new American landscape from a moving aerial "carry-go-round" with upholstered seats. It was almost like taking a cross-country ride in an airplane, certainly a rarity in <date when="1939">1939</date>.</p>
<p>The <date when="1939">1939</date> World's Fair marked a pivotal mo-ment in American life when the United States stood on the brink of World War II. Following the war, American business and industry led the nation to unparalleled prosperity, in the process rising to the status of powerful political entities within the national life as they allied with government to form what became known as the military-industrial complex. By the time the <date when="1964">1964</date> fair took place on the original fair-<lb/>
grounds at Flushing Meadow, the United States had already begun its fateful participation in the Vietnam War, following policies that would seriously under-<lb/>
mine trust in government.</p>
<p>Not long before the popular will asserted itself nationally in protest against the war in Vietnam, there arose in <name type="place">New York</name> a popular reaction to <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>' authoritarian style of planning public works projects. Jane Jacobs, the magazine editor turned urban critic and theorist, saw the small-block scale and mixed residential and commercial uses in older neighborhoods as sources of irreplaceable human vitality. She organized her community to fight suc-<lb/>
cessfully against <name type="pname">Moses</name>'s proposed Lower Manhat-<lb/>
tan Expressway, which would have destroyed much of the urban fabric of the West Village, where she lived, and the area of the city now known as SoHo. At the same time, she built the case against super-<lb/>
block urban renewal projects&#x2014;the descendants of Le Corbusier's Radiant City&#x2014;in her influential book <hi rend="italic">Death and Life_of Great American Cities</hi> (<date when="1961">1961</date>).</p>
<p>While Jacobs and others were calling for a revaluation of the American city, many middle-class residents were abandoning it, choosing the life of the commuter suburbs alluringly portrayed at the <date when="1939">1939</date> World of Tomorrow. Postwar affluence and the pent-up demand for material goods, delayed by the Great Depression and the prolonged national emer-<lb/>
gency, caused a fever of consumerism that idealistic social thinkers such as Mumford and Stein probably found appalling. Mumford's vision of the regionally planned future was evocatively portrayed in his con-<lb/>
temporary documentary film <hi rend="italic">The City,</hi> directed by <name type="pname">Pare Lorentz</name> and with music by Aaron Copland. But forces other than planning ideals were at work, shap-<lb/>
ing the urban region. Government-sponsored loan programs designed for veterans and other qualified buyers abetted single-family home ownership. The federal interstate highway building program increased the commercial value of rural land, espe-<lb/>
cially near expressway interchanges, and this had a powerful and broad-scale effect upon the entire American landscape. A new type of development, the shopping center, began to drain business vitality from the centers of cities and a new term, <hi rend="italic">suburbia,</hi> was coined to denote the sprawling residential mass formed by the bedroom communities of the com-<lb/>
muter generation. From the perspective of urban sprawl, as the most recent manifestation of this free-market trend is called, one may look back with admiration and some regret at the failed dreams of those who followed in Ebenezer Howard's footsteps.</p>
<p>After World War II, Americans became more receptive to European modernist architecture. Although popular eclectic taste still caused houses to be built in a variety of pseudohistorical idioms, there was a growing appreciation of the stylistic possibili-<lb/>
ties, construction economies, and functionalism of modern architecture in the United States as well as in Europe and South America. Landscape architects used garden design as an experimental laboratory to develop a style that was similarly emancipated from past tradition. Their efforts produced a new, if at times uncertain, direction for the profession. Whether they worked to create a regional idiom informed by local topology as did Jens Jensen, borrowed ideas from abstract art, or adhered to the architectural pre-<lb/>
cepts of such exponents of European modernism as Le Corbusier and Gropius, these designers shared one characteristic: They were polemical. They would not warm their talents in the sunset glow of Beaux-<lb/>
Arts tradition as did the landscape architects who worked for <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>. Modernism put a premium on iconoclasm, invention, and the new. It encouraged them to be original. They sought to address the needs of their time through rational, scientific problem solving. Contemporary lifestyle&#x2014;especially the lei-<lb/>
sure-loving one being invented by culturally unfet-<lb/>
tered Californians&#x2014;replaced past style as the modernist landscape designers' touchstone. Innova-<lb/>
tion, not tradition, became their watchword.</p>

In <date when="1934">1934</date>, there were 14,827 acres of park lands of which 928 acres represented land under water. Today there are 35,760 acres, of which 9,670 acres represent land under water reserved for wildlife and used for boating, bathing and fishing, and another 2,970 acres devoted to roadways in our parkway system. The total acreage rep-<lb/>
resents approximately 17.5 per cent of the total area of the City of <name type="place">New York</name>." This statistical emphasis reflected the agency's service atti-<lb/>
tude, one of keeping up with demand. Under the heading of "Golf," the <date when="1964">1964</date> Department of Parks reported that during the previous two years it had kept pace with demand: "The com-<lb/>

<figure xml:id="fig-534">

</figure>
<p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, an eclectic appli-<lb/>
cation of past styles of landscape design had substituted for one expressing in a forthright, forceful, and original manner the tenets of contemporary Machine Age culture. Le Corbusier railed famously against "the Styles," and when architectural modernism at last found widespread acceptance, it became doctrinal in its rad-<lb/>
ical break with tradition. No longer would architects camouflage the structural engineering systems of new buildings with the decor of previous eras as had been the case in modern nineteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury <name type="place">Paris</name>, where carved masonry was applied as a veneer over industrial materials. In the same way that modern artists sought to abandon old formalist values including single-point perspective as the generally accepted convention of spatial representation, archi-<lb/>
tects sought to express an entirely new aesthetic that was func-<lb/>
tionalist, democratic, and overtly expressive of machine technology. The avoidance of Neoclassical planning principles and handcrafted ornamentation became an article of faith for modern architects. Yet, while modern architecture overthrew eclecticism and devel-<lb/>
oped its own radically functionalist aesthetic, landscape architec-<lb/>
ture lagged behind.</p>
<p>A somewhat debased version of Arts and Crafts garden style was well suited to the agenda of an expanding nursery industry with a broad array of plant materials and garden ornaments for sale. Moreover, the machinelike precision found in modernist archi-<lb/>
tecture and a good deal of modern art was never wholly applicable to landscape design, because nature is biological and tectonic, not static. However hard-edged a ground plan may be, if it contains plants and soil and responds to the dynamics of natural ecosystems, its forms are inevitably subject to growth, decay, and the resulting organic transformation these processes involve. So argued those who sought to maintain a traditionalist approach to landscape design in the face of architectural modernism. In the United States, throughout the <date when="1930">1930</date>s the Harvard's Graduate School of Design, the leading professional school for training in landscape architec-<lb/>
ture, remained firmly committed to a Beaux-Arts-based curricu-<lb/>
lum with its emphasis upon an Italianate stylistic vocabulary, even as Walter Gropius was transforming the school's architecture department into an outpost of the European avant-garde.</p>
<p>But as provincialism and reactionary taste succumbed to the establishment of modern art and as modern architecture gained sta-<lb/>
tus and began to seem less revolutionary, American professionals began at last to participate in the spirit of landscape design innova-<lb/>
tion that the French had pioneered at the <date when="1925">1925</date> Exposition Interna-<lb/>
tionale des Arts D&#x00E9;coratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts). Unlike pre-<lb/>
vious World's Fairs, which had emphasized technological progress, this one was distinguished by the impulse on the part of the French to establish cultural leadership in the design arts. Within the Fair's articulation of a vocabulary of design forms&#x2014;now nostalgically recalled and revived as Art Moderne or Art Deco&#x2014;existed several early experiments that attempted to ally landscape with modernism. But modernism had many faces besides the one of streamlined luxe known as Art Deco, including the machine aesthetic of the Bauhaus and of Le Corbusier, whose architecture was represented as one of the fair's pavilions. A Mediterranean spirit often informed it. Chinese and Japanese influences were present, too.</p>
<p>By the late <date when="1930">1930</date>s, the carriers of modernism's several cultural crosscurrents included Mexican and South American landscape designers as well as European and American ones. Like architec-<lb/>
ture, landscape design became a regionally inflected international idiom. Although the United States still looked to Europe in cultural matters, the country's prosperity and the developments in indus-<lb/>
trial design as new consumer goods were produced following World War II created a climate that was congenial to innovation
<pb n="435"/>
<pb n="435" type="orig"/>
and the eventual assumption of a leadership role in the arts. This process was no doubt encouraged by the immigration to the United States from the <date when="1930">1930</date>s onward of several European artists of rare genius. In addition, now, more than ever, travel abroad was seen as a valuable extension of the professional education of Amer-<lb/>
ican designers along with the study of internationally circulated periodicals and books portraying the new. A stripped-down form of Beaux-Arts landscape design prevailed in a good deal of Amer-<lb/>
ican public park design as late as the <date when="1950">1950</date>s, as is evident from the parks built in <name type="place">New York</name> City and under the administration of <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name> (see Chapter Twelve). Nevertheless, traditional land-<lb/>
scape architecture based on Neoclassical planning principles had begun to seem anachronistic within the context of modernism's disavowal of historic styles and the premium it put on a certain shock value in the arts.</p>
<p>Moreover, within the context of a democratic society tradi-<lb/>
tionalism was associated with a conservative elite. Progressive land-<lb/>
scape architects needed to produce plans that were suitable for the construction budgets, lot sizes, and lives of middle-class home-<lb/>
owners. The emphasis modern people put on sports and physical recreation caused them to want houses and gardens that were more casual in appearance than those of former times, with open floor plans and informal ground plans that permitted the same uncon-<lb/>
stricted movement as did the relaxed clothing they now wore. This casual lifestyle, especially in <name type="place">California</name> where a freewheeling cul-<lb/>
tural ethos prevailed overall, encouraged a fresh approach to land-<lb/>
scape design. Here and in other warm-climate areas, outdoor entertaining and relaxation in and around a swimming pool were important elements in the landscape designer's program.</p>
<p>The spirit of radical innovation that characterized art and architecture of the modernist period gave license to the landscape designer to experiment with new forms and materials. New design concepts&#x2014;the use of overlapping planes rather than axial align-<lb/>
ment to provide spatial continuity, experimentation with both tra-<lb/>
ditional and nontraditional materials, use of abstract biomorphic forms as emblems and expressions of organic fluidity, and an inno-<lb/>
vative application of the machine aesthetic to garden structures furnished the modernist landscape with its own distinctive idiom as it addressed the age-old problem of exploiting visually the jux-<lb/>
taposition of the natural and the artificial.</p>
<p>Compensating for the elimination of applied ornament in Machine Age modern architecture was the new status given free-<lb/>
standing sculpture. The visual impact of the bronze nude by Georg Kolbe in the courtyard of the Barcelona Pavilion Mies van der Rohe built for that city's <date when="1929">1929</date> World's Fair is enhanced by the duty it per-<lb/>
forms, which is beyond all inherent aesthetic merit, as the only non-<lb/>
machine form within the structure, demonstrating the power of a single art object to arrest and satisfy the eye as it completes its move-<lb/>
ment through the building's serenely impersonal overlapping spa-<lb/>
tial planes. So, too, as landscape architecture became more avowedly functional and abstract, several designers found that the perfectly placed piece by Jacques Lipchitz or Henry Moore gave composi-<lb/>
tional focus to their plans. Sculpture had, of course, been at home in the garden since ancient times, as we have amply discovered in this book, but with the advent of modernism it took up residence in the landscape devoid of the didactic or memorial intent of for-<lb/>
mer times. In the modern garden sculpture was not intended as part of any allegorical program, nor was it meant to serve as com-<lb/>
memoration; it was displayed simply as aesthetic object. The instal-<lb/>
lation of outdoor sculpture according to the reputation of the artist rather than that of the subject depicted is a modernist contribution to landscape design. Corporations took a major role in this regard, and the same companies that commissioned prestigious modern architects to design their headquarters also installed major works of sculpture in adjacent plazas or surrounding industrial parks.</p>
<p>The challenges facing twentieth-century designers who sought to practice within the broader context of a rapidly trans-<lb/>
forming society with objectives that were more democratic in pur-<lb/>
pose than the provision of corporate prestige or idyllic retreats for the wealthy were considerable. As had been true in past ages, many of the patrons who commissioned modern gardens, corporate cam-<lb/>
puses, and high-style modern buildings with sculpture courts or plazas were indeed wealthy. Modernism's confidence in design as a primary means of addressing social problems now seems over-<lb/>
weening and, in light of the record, often wrongheaded. This has promoted the current return to neo-traditional principles in urban planning that we will examine in Chapter Fifteen. But the land-<lb/>
scape architects who came of age in the first half of the twentieth century shared the same optimism that we observed in the previ-<lb/>
ous chapter as we studied the regional planners who sought to rationally guide metropolitan growth or the starry-eyed futurists who displayed their upbeat technologically oriented scenarios for the World of Tomorrow at the <name type="place">New York</name> <date when="1939">1939</date> World's Fair. Espe-<lb/>
cially in <name type="place">America</name>, which was less scarred than Europe by the twen-<lb/>
tieth century's two World Wars, modernism held forth a sense of immense possibilities, and in an age that has become fetishistic about preserving and replicating the past, this optimism about the future may seem enviable to some.</p>

The <name type="place">New York</name> fair was a demonstration of burgeoning American industrial might and the consumerist future.

<p><name type="pname">Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier</name> (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1930">1930</date>), the land-<lb/>
scape architect who had had design responsibilities for several of the parks of <name type="place">Paris</name> since <date when="1887">1887</date>, was put in charge of all parks and gardens at the exhibition. Clearly evident was his own stylistic preference for Gallic for-<lb/>
mality softened by an Arts and Crafts horticultural palette and enlivened eclectically through the influence of Persia and southern Spain. Also evident was the influence of Cubism, Surrealism, and functionalism. The fair's purposeful endorsement of modernity was made somewhat superficial by the impulse to show-<lb/>
case design style, as implied by the word <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;coratif</hi> in the exposition's title. Several of the gardens of the fair were conceived as outdoor manifestations of Art Deco, the sleekly ornamental style found in the luxurious but spare furniture and architectural design of the period. A consensus that these modernistic gardens should be architectonic in character as well as architectural exten-<lb/>
sions of the house caused them to be more mineral than vegetal in character.</p>
<p>On a triangular site framed on two sides by glass walls, <name type="pname">Gabriel Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian</name> (<date when="1900">1900</date>&#x2013;<date when="1970">1970</date>) designed the Garden of Water and Light, the most avant-garde gar-<lb/>
den at the <date when="1925">1925</date> <name type="place">Paris</name> Exposition (fig. 13.1). Forestier commissioned it, expecting Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian to create a viewing garden, a <hi rend="italic">tableau-jardin</hi> "in the modern spirit with elements from Persian decor."<ref target="#CH13-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref>Its triangular shape announced the geometric motif contained in the small opaque pinkish panes of glass forming its screening walls, the zigzag pattern of flower beds arranged on an inclined plane, the subdivisions of its tiered pool, and some of the facets of an electrically illuminated, revolving, polyhedral sphere in its cen-<lb/>
ter. As a modernistic garden designer, Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian did not consider plants interesting in their own right but deployed them simply as bedded masses of bold shapes and striking colors.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Charles de Noailles</name>, an enthusiastic collector of modern art, was so impressed with Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian's cre-<lb/>
ation at the fair that he commissioned him to design a garden in Hy&#x00E8;res where the architect Robert Mallet-<lb/>
Stevens was building a villa for him and his wife Marie-Laure. Here, in <date when="1927">1927</date>, Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian created a gar-<lb/>
den in a space that appeared like the bow of a beached ship (fig. 13.2). Divorced from the surrounding land-<lb/>
scape by stark white converging walls forming an elongated isosceles triangle, the sharp geometries of
<pb n="437"/>
<pb n="437" type="orig"/>
rectangular flower beds, mosaic paving panels, and pool set within these uncompromising boundaries assert a mathematical, antinatural angularity. Though often called a Cubist garden, it is unavoidably three-<lb/>
dimensional because it is an architectural space and cannot therefore have the elusive, tensile interplay between picture surface and picture space of a Cubist painting.<ref target="#CH13-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>The Noailles garden did have, however, one element that linked it with the modern abstract art movement, a revolving sculpture by <name type="pname">Jacques Lipchitz</name> (<date when="1891">1891</date>&#x2013;<date when="1973">1973</date>) called <hi rend="italic">La Joie de vivre (The Joy of Life).</hi> Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian gave this pride of place at the apex of the isosceles triangle, the "prow" of the Noailles garden "ship." As modern garden design increasingly assumed a minimalist approach to horticulture, designers frequently placed large-scale works of sculp-<lb/>
ture like this Lipchitz piece in their landscape com-<lb/>
positions simply for aesthetic effect. This quite naturally gave rise in time to gardens where the designers' primary goal was to arrange an outdoor setting for the display of works of art. Notable later examples in the <name type="place">New York</name> metropolitan area include the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art in <name type="place">New York</name> City, Storm King Art Center in Moun-<lb/>
tainville, and the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in Long Island City.</p>
<p>At the time of the <date when="1925">1925</date> exposition, <name type="pname">Charles</name> and <name type="pname">Marie-Laure de Noailles</name> commissioned a second modernist essay in garden design on the 5,000-square-<lb/>
foot (1,524-square-meter) triangle of land adjacent to their nineteenth-century <hi rend="italic">h&#x00F4;tel</hi> in <name type="place">Paris</name> (fig. 13.3). Like their garden by Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian in Noailles, the Parisian garden by Andr&#x00E9; Vera (<date when="1881">1881</date>&#x2013;<date when="1971">1971</date>) and his brother <name type="pname">Paul Vera</name> (<date when="1882">1882</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>), a decorative artist, in collabo-<lb/>
ration with their friend <name type="pname">Jean-Charles Moreau</name> (<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x2013;<date when="1956">1956</date>) was primarily a viewing garden, its veg-<lb/>
etation being limited to low shrub masses and ground covers set within a ground plane of paving stones, pebbles, and gravel. A lattice-topped wall of light-<lb/>

<p>These and other avant-garde expressions of pos-<lb/>

Harvard had just initiated the country's first graduate program in landscape architecture, and there Steele studied for a year with Fred-<lb/>
erick Law Olmsted, Jr., and Arthur Shurtleff, another member of the Olmsted firm. Their design approach was that of the prevailing Beaux-Arts system with its respect for axial planning and architectural integra-<lb/>
tion of building and site. The arduous curriculum combined these planning principles with studies in art history, architecture, surveying, hydrology, road and wall construction, geology, meteorology, phys-<lb/>
iography, botany, horticulture, plant identification, planting design, mathematics, languages, and con-<lb/>
tracts and specifications.</p>

</figure>
<p>Rather than return to Harvard the following year, Steele accepted the offer made by <name type="pname">Warren Henry Manning</name> (<date when="1860">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1938">1938</date>), a landscape architect trained by Olmsted Sr., to serve as his personal assistant and supervisor of planting for the firm. The son of a well-<lb/>
established nurseryman and the author of much of the planting plan for the Biltmore estate, Manning was an acknowledged plantsman. Having designed the park system for <name type="place">Harrisburg</name>, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, he was also a city planner, as well as busy professional with many important private commissions. Steele's apprenticeship with Manning lasted six years. It gave the aspiring young landscape architect a practical edu-<lb/>
cation that he valued above Harvard's academic one. His experience in Manning's <name type="place">Boston</name> firm, combined with his intelligence, gift with words, and social skills, enabled Steele to begin an independent practice after returning from an extended study tour of European gardens in <date when="1913">1913</date>. In this new phase of his career he absorbed the ideas of his friend, the Gothic Revival
<pb n="438"/>
<pb n="438" type="orig"/>
architect <name type="pname">Ralph Adams Cram</name> (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x2013;<date when="1942">1942</date>), as well as ideas gleaned from frequent travels abroad. After serv-<lb/>
ice as a photographer in World War I, he resumed his practice and gained a reputation as an outspoken shaper of opinion, engaging lecturer, and frequent contributor to professional and popular periodicals such as <hi rend="italic">Landscape Architecture, House Beautiful,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gar-<lb/>
den Club of <name type="place">America</name> Bulletin.</hi></p>
<p>The <date when="1920">1920</date>s were mostly prosperous years up until the Great Depression, and Steele's practice flourished as wealthy clients called upon his services. But his inter-<lb/>
ests in landscape design went beyond estate design. In Steele's view, the middle-class suburban garden should be a place of privacy with hedges or tall shrubbery screening it from passersby, a place for family life, friendship, and daydreaming. Modern psychology, with its emphasis upon the facets of individual per-<lb/>
sonality and the importance of dreams, was a signifi-<lb/>
cant ingredient in his approach to garden design. Increasingly, Steele intended his gardens to serve as quasi-magical private realms where landscape art encouraged relaxation into a state of reverie and fan-<lb/>
tasy, spaces in which their owners would find freedom from the conventions that governed their daily lives.</p>
<p>In <date when="1924">1924</date>, he published <hi rend="italic">Design in the Little Garden.</hi> Here he argued for functional domestic arrange-<lb/>
ments, advising home builders to eliminate useless front lawns, place kitchen, garage, and laundry yard on the street side for convenience, and screen them from public view with shrubbery. If this were done, "our living-rooms should open on the old despised back-yards now turned into gardens and terraces, no matter how small. . . . With such a scheme we may be content that not a foot of room has been wasted; that everything is where use and common sense would have it; and that finally we have cleared the old back-yard to make ready for a proper setting for our out-of-door life."<ref target="#CH13-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In his writing Steele was bold enough to criti-<lb/>
cize the Olympian serenity of Le N&#x00F4;tre, suggesting that in landscape design rationality should be tem-<lb/>
pered with sensuality and a degree of poetic mystery. But French culture exerted a powerful hold upon his imagination, and he kept abreast of the published works of Forestier and Andr&#x00E9; Vera and returned from the <name type="place">Paris</name> exposition of <date when="1925">1925</date> filled with both positive and negative opinions on all that he had seen. He was excited by modernism's design potential for the cre-<lb/>
ative landscape architect, and on subsequent trips to <name type="place">France</name> he continued to study such gardens as the one Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian created for the Noailles in Hy&#x00E8;res. His article, "New Pioneering in Garden Design," pub-<lb/>
lished in <hi rend="italic">Landscape Architecture</hi> in <date when="1930">1930</date>, praises Tony Garnier for giving the garden "a marked vibration" by modifying symmetrical axial planning in a way that "the axis is broken again and again, although rarely entirely lost."<ref target="#CH13-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Steele's enthusiasm for abstract, nonassocia-<lb/>
tional design concepts was transmitted to a new gen-<lb/>
eration of young landscape architects, among them Garrett Eckbo, James Rose, and Daniel Urban Kiley (like Steele, an apprentice in Warren Manning's firm). This group of American modernist landscape design-<lb/>
ers also learned from Steele how to take into account their clients' twentieth-century lifestyle, with its more casual domesticity, fewer servants, and increased appreciation for the outdoors. They perceived rightly that Steele was both a link with the Beaux-Arts tradi-<lb/>
tion and, because of his openness to experiment and innovation, the profession's foremost modernist influ-<lb/>
ence in <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
<p>Steele's masterpiece, Naumkeag, the estate of Mabel Choate in <name type="place">Stockbridge</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, begun in <date when="1926">1926</date>, bears witness to the synthesis of his Beaux-<lb/>
Arts training and deep appreciation of historic exam-<lb/>
ples with his delight in modernism's abstract shaping of space and exploration of bold new materials, forms, and color. To this synthesis he added his own desire to design individualized garden spaces that were highly experiential outdoor rooms. Steele found the garden already there to be satisfactory in many respects. It had been designed by Nathan Barrett of <name type="place">Boston</name>, the author of two early land-planning devel-<lb/>
opments&#x2014;the industrial community of Pullman, <name type="place">Illi-<lb/>
nois</name>, and the residential suburb of Tuxedo Park, <name type="place">New York</name>&#x2014;after Joseph Choate had chosen to ignore Frederick Law Olmsted's advice to situate the house half-way down the hillside near a particularly fine oak tree, preferring instead the top of Prospect Hill.</p>

<p>Here Steele set about doing the thing he liked best, shaping landscape space, analyzing existing and desirable conditions in order to determine the out-<lb/>
lines of Mabel Choate's proposed new terrace, or Afternoon Garden: its relationship to the house (a location was chosen next to the library), a wall to screen the entrance drive, the inclusion of a large elm
<pb n="439"/>
<pb n="439" type="orig"/>
tree within its embrace, a means of framing the view (fig. 13.4). Ingeniously, he decided to have an Italian sculptor carve old oak pilings from <name type="place">Boston</name> harbor in a bold "Norwegian" manner. The masts were never-<lb/>
theless meant to evoke the posts used for tying up gondolas in the canals of <name type="place">Venice</name>, and their flaring finial-crowned, multicolored tops were painted to resemble "medieval trappings." These imaginative uprights framed the splendid view of the rolling Berk-<lb/>
shires, and nothing more was needed to give the ter-<lb/>
race a sense of spatial enclosure than a swag of rope festooned with clematis and <name type="place">Virginia</name> creeper running between the vertical posts. A sculpture, <hi rend="italic">Boy with Heron,</hi> by <name type="pname">Frederick MacMonnies</name> (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x2013;<date when="1937">1937</date>), was taken from inside the house and placed, not on the terrace as one might expect, but at the perimeter, where it could act as a foreground foil to the land-<lb/>
scape beyond.</p>
<p>Steele then enlivened the ground plane with "four little fountains, memories of the Generalife" gardens in Granada (see fig. 3.9). Their scalloped edges set in motion a series of curves that, like "an old French knot," consisted of an edging of minia-<lb/>
ture box within which blue lobelia mulched with coal, yellow santolina, and pink crushed marble provided color, while a small black-glass-lined pool reflected the sky. Irregular brown flagstones surrounded the "giddy carpet" Steele had thus flung down, and on this paving with its green cushions of arenaria squeezing through the crevices and on the rustic masonry retaining walls of the terrace he now placed pots filled with fuchsias, calla lilies, agapanthus, and bamboo like those he had seen in the quiet patios of Seville or C&#x00F3;rdoba. Beds of ferns and lilies in the corners, a quietly dripping wall fountain, and "thrones" with matching footstools of pink concrete completed the evocative picture.<ref target="#CH13-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Steele's growing originality as a designer was manifested in a second campaign to improve the land-<lb/>
scape at Naumkeag between <date when="1929">1929</date> and <date when="1935">1935</date>. Now more than ever, he saw his art not only as one of shap-<lb/>
ing space, but also as one of making foreground and background enter into a design dialogue similar to that found in the Japanese garden when borrowed scenery is a compositional element. Together client and landscape architect discussed the problem of the South Lawn and its relationship to the spectacular view. The collaborators' stroke of genius was the cre-<lb/>
ation of what Robin Karson, Steele's biographer, calls "the first modern earthwork in this country," a bold curve sculpted of landfill Miss Choate appropriated from a nearby excavation for a new house foundation. The line of its sloping ridge and the sweeping arc it traced on the ground provided a harmonious fore-<lb/>
ground echo of the view toward Bear Mountain that had been revealed by tree pruning. As Steele later commented, "The only resource was to create an abstract form in the manner of modern sculpture, with swinging curves and slopes which would aim to make their impression directly, without calling on the help of associated ideas, whether in nature or art."<ref target="#CH13-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref> A line of locust trees with globular heads emphasize this form in the landscape (fig. 13.5). Steele and Choate then fashioned an original bit of <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi> out of recy-<lb/>
cled ornamental cast iron, which they placed at the terminus of the South Lawn, later setting within it a Chinese-scholar garden rock on a Ming pedestal.</p>

<pb n="440"/>
<pb n="440" type="orig"/>
prompted by the presence of native birches elsewhere on the property, Steele planted a dense grove of these trees in the intervening spaces between the four sets of stairs. The tonal correspondence of the white trunks and the white railings, together with the jux-<lb/>

<p>Included in the small and vanishing circle of monied Americans who could indulge a passion for landscape design on their private estates than could <name type="pname">Mabel Choate</name> were <name type="pname">Walter Beck</name> (<date when="1864">1864</date>&#x2013;<date when="1954">1954</date>) and his wife, <name type="pname">Marion Burt Stone Beck</name> (<date when="1876">1876</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959">1959</date>). On the 950-acre property she owned in Millbrook, <name type="place">New York</name>, when they married in <date when="1922">1922</date>, the couple set out to create an English-style landscape surrounding their newly com-<lb/>
pleted Queen Anne-style house, which was modeled on Wisley, the experimental plant headquarters of the Royal Horticultural Society in <name type="place">England</name>.<ref target="#CH13-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref>Beck was an artist with a deep appreciation of Chinese land-<lb/>
scape painting. Around <date when="1930">1930</date>, after having studied descriptions and images of the famous garden of Wang Wei, the Tang dynasty official who was a poet, painter, and garden builder (see Chapter Eight), he became convinced that Chinese design principles, rather than English ones, should govern Innisfree, as the couple called their garden after the poem of that title by William Butler Yeats.</p>
<p>Paintings after Wang Wei's original painting of his Wangchuan Villa garden consist of twenty scenes, compositional groupings of pines and other trees with various small structures set beside a broad river, which is cradled by softly rounded mountains. The bowl-like character of this landscape of rising forms rimming the river basin, as well as the gently cupped aspects of the individual scenes within it, appealed to Beck, who began to create around the lake in Millbrook a series of highly poetic "cup gardens" using weathered stones in carefully balanced compositions. With a work crew of twenty, Beck mined promising parts of the estate where boulders with the fine sculptural qualities prized by Chinese garden-builders lay partially buried in the knobby glacial till. He then ordered these excavated treasures to be transported to the sites where he wished to compose his cup gardens. One of these gar-<lb/>
dens might take the form of a rock- and vegetation-<lb/>
rimmed hollow. Another might appear as an overturned teacup, thereby resembling one of the softly rounded, mist-wreathed mountains in a paint-<lb/>
ing of Wang Wei's garden. Beck took exquisite care in placing his rocks, using well-concealed cement to anchor them after achieving an intuitively "just right," often precarious, balance. He also took pains to find the appropriate compositional "dialogue" between
<pb n="441"/>
<pb n="441" type="orig"/>
landscape and rocks and among the various individ-<lb/>
ual rocks (fig. 13.8). Having invested the carefully selected stones with pictorial character, he then gave them names&#x2014;Tiptoe Rock, Dragon Rock, Owl Rock, and Turtle Rock.</p>
<p>A comprehensive treatment of the entire land-<lb/>
scape surrounding the lake on the Becks' Millbrook property had to await the integrative vision supplied by Lester Collins (<date when="1914">1914</date>&#x2013;<date when="1993">1993</date>), a Harvard-trained land-<lb/>
scape architect who had spent two years in China fol-<lb/>
lowed by a year in Kyoto. The Becks met Collins during his student days; he became instrumental in the garden's creation, and at Marion Beck's invitation after her husband's death in <date when="1954">1954</date>, its principal creative force and the author of the plan transforming it from a private Elysium into a garden for public visitation. Collins took over Innisffee's design in <date when="1960">1960</date> where Beck had left off, arranging the several cup gardens into an integrated composition threaded with paths to link them. He made the overall landscape kineti-<lb/>
cally experiential. A knowledgeable horticulturist, as was Marion Beck who also contributed ideas, Collins enhanced some of Beck's cup gardens with vegeta-<lb/>
tion and created special effects of his own. He also constructed several earthen berms, recontouring the land in order to frame views, direct movement, or develop a topographical profile that would either terminate a vista or else stimulate interest in what lay beyond. He designed the garden's wood bridges and the eighty wooden chairs in which visitors can now repose. Collins compared the Innisfree garden with its many individual scenes connected by paths and bridges with the Yuan Ming Yuan, the famous garden begun by the Yongzheng emperor and completed by the Qianlong emperor in the eighteenth-century Qing dynasty (see Chapter Eight).</p>
<p>In scale, the Millbrook garden is analogous to this imperial garden, and its studied tranquility evokes the mood of the broad river-valley scenery depicted in paintings of Wang Wei's garden; these, not the miniaturized landscapes of the Suzhou scholar-gar-<lb/>
dens, were the exemplars for Beck and Collins at Innisfree. But while the designers may have had the Yuan Ming Yuan most clearly in mind, Innisfree can also be compared with two other cupped lake-gardens exam-<lb/>
ined in Chapters Seven and Eight: Henry Hoare's Stourhead and Shugakuin Rikyu, the lifework of the retired Japanese emperor Go-Mizunoo. Like these, Innisfree is a highly personal aesthetic statement, an exercise in garden poetics. Beck and Collins merely applied Chinese landscape design principles and rock vocabulary toward this end; they had no intention of replicating a Chinese garden in any more exact sense. Beck's inventiveness and training as an artist are evi-<lb/>
dent not only in his Chinese-inspired rock arrange-<lb/>
ments but also in his retaining walls and stair steps. His technical ability as both an artist and a craftsman is especially apparent in the patterned brick-and-slate terrace he designed, with a dragon panel incised by him (fig. 13.9).</p>
<p>Collins's year in <name type="place">Japan</name> resulted in his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Sensai Hisho</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Secret Garden Book.</hi> Its principles, particularly those concerning the construction of waterfalls, proved instructive as he and Beck worked together to achieve some of Innisffee's most beauti-<lb/>
ful effects.<ref target="#CH13-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>Few drawings of the gardens at Innisfree exist, although Collins was a practicing landscape architect and an academic dean. All was created on the site, using Beck's own work crew. Garden hoses outlined a future shoreline or path, and stakes or a human figure stood in the landscape to help deter-<lb/>
mine the position of a boulder. Patient experiment was needed to engineer a waterfall in such a way that it produced a cloud of mist, the merest trickle over a rock lip, a fluid sheet glossing a surface of schist or granite, a pluming jet, or a silvery runnel (fig. 13.10). Engineering expertise conducted this water into the ground where a carefully constructed drainage sys-<lb/>
tem carries it to the water table or the lake.</p>

<pb n="442"/>

unromantic secret of Innisfree's continuing evolution from an ordinary second-growth woodland and gla-<lb/>

isfree conceals its technological apparatus beneath an Arts and Crafts aesthetic informed by Chinese art and organizes space in the manner of a traditional stroll garden. Collins's ability to effect a synthesis between art and nature through design and technology helped transform Innisfree from a private dreamworld into a publicly acces-<lb/>
sible one. He gave due consideration to visitor interest, comfort, and safety; at the same time he cut staff in order to work within the budget of the Innisfree Foun-<lb/>
dation, which owns and operates the garden.</p>

<p>Personal Elysiums like Naumkeag and Innisfree, throwbacks to an earlier tradition of great estate land-<lb/>
scapes, illustrate the growing influence of East Asian ideals on Western gar-<lb/>
dens. Like the Edwardian gardens we have studied, their fundamental purpose was to serve as idyllic retreats from the Machine Age. In <name type="place">England</name>, in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s, the long-lingering aesthetic of the Picturesque, the mellowing hand of the Arts and Crafts Movement, the energies of plant hybridizers, and a vigorous nursery trade still actively informed public taste, perpetuating this conservative landscape tradition. At the same time, however, a committed modernist dared to voice the grounds for radical change and to examine how the planning principles of the Japanese garden might stimulate a new approach to landscape design.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Christopher Tunnard's Influential Book</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Christopher Tunnard</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1979">1979</date>) was a Canadian-<lb/>
born landscape architect who worked in <name type="place">England</name> and then took up permanent residence in the United States where he became a professor of city planning first at Harvard and then at Yale.<ref target="#CH13-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>No one who knew him in <name type="place">America</name>, where he was a strong advocate of historic preservation, would have guessed that he had been an early firebrand in the cause of landscape modernism while still a young man living in <name type="place">England</name>. But Tunnard, like Fletcher Steele, had taken note of Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian's bold departure from tradition, and other new landscape design developments in <name type="place">France</name> and elsewhere in Europe. A member of the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS), the British affiliate of the Congr&#x00E8;s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), Tunnard was impressed with the polemical rhetoric and the work of <name type="pname">Adolf Loos</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1933">1933</date>) and Le Corbusier.</p>
<p>Tunnard was also familiar with landscape design history and English gardening tradition. Without con-<lb/>
sidering the relationship between older landscape idioms and cultural values, in <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the Modern Landscape</hi> (<date when="1938">1938</date>), a loosely woven collection of revised essays on the subject, he adopted the radical stance then current among modern architects of debunking past styles. Having set up this foil of discredited his-<lb/>
tory, Tunnard was ready to study how "as an element inseparable from the problems of housing, and urban and rural development, garden planning can, with the least opposition, achieve its modern form." Quoting Loos ("To find beauty in form instead of making it depend on ornament is the goal to which humanity is aspiring") and Le Corbusier ("The styles are a lie"), he set forth his own doctrine: "The functional garden," he wrote, "avoids the extremes both of the sen-<lb/>
timental expressionism of the wild garden and the intellectual classicism of the ‘formal' garden; it embodies rather a spirit of rationalism and through an aesthetic and practical ordering of its units pro-<lb/>
vides a friendly and hospitable milieu for rest and recreation. It is, in effect, the social conception of the garden."<ref target="#CH13-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>He declared that "China's symbolical landscape gardens with their islands of eternal youth and hap-<lb/>
piness&#x2014;scenes which provoked a century of Nature-<lb/>
copyism in the West&#x2014;hold little for us." But in Japanese gardens he found a congenial minimalism,
<pb n="443"/>
<pb n="443" type="orig"/>
integration of indoor and outdoor space, and the compositional principle he called "occult balance," whereby counterpoise was achieved through an asymmetrical arrangement of parts in equilibrium along a diagonal axis. The Japanese editorial hand that pruned away unnecessary vegetation and carefully arranged those plants that remained for subtle but maximum effect was in keeping with modernism's movement away from a "barbaric massing of color" toward "an acceptance of form, line and economy of material as being of first importance."<ref target="#CH13-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Tunnard allied himself with such modern archi-<lb/>
tects as Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. The former's country villas, raised from the ground by pilotis, were dissociated from nature but nevertheless presided over broad views that were an important aspect of their architectural planning and expressed a pastoral tradition harking back to Virgil.<ref target="#CH13-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref>The houses of the latter, on the other hand, sometimes grasped raw nature in an intimate embrace, as is par-<lb/>
ticularly evident in Fallingwater of <date when="1937">1937</date>, Wright's most famous work, poised above Bear Run, in west-<lb/>
ern Pennsylvania. Both of these modernists created architecture that corresponded with what Tunnard called the "empathic" approach to landscape planning whereby "nature is not to be regarded as a refuge from life, but as an invigorator of it and a stimulus to body and mind."<ref target="#CH13-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref>If one of the unstated motives of such Picturesque theorists as Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight had been to make untamed nature more agreeable by considering it as art, that was now no longer an issue. By the mid-twentieth century, much of nature had been tamed, and it needed no apologists; it was simply there in the form of sunlight, fresh air, and good views to be actively, <hi rend="italic">functionally</hi> enjoyed. Included in the empathic, func-<lb/>
tionalist layout were outdoor dining areas, decks, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other accou-<lb/>
trements of modern life with its orientation to leisure and recreation. Tunnard's later follower, Garrett Eckbo, called this a "landscape for living." (These aspects of design did not engage the imaginations of either Le Corbusier or Wright, who were more romantic than functionalist in their approach to nature.)</p>
<p>Further, Tunnard urged the collaboration of modern artists in the landscape design process; archi-<lb/>
tects were already working with sculptors and painters. Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion of <date when="1929">1929</date> was a notable recent example of the symbiosis of Machine Age architectural form and materials and a single per-<lb/>
fectly placed work of sculpture. The Noailles garden in Hy&#x00E8;res showed how effective the sculpture by Lip-<lb/>
chitz was as an element in the landscape.</p>
<p>Tunnard's own career as a landscape architect was brief, and he later retreated from radical mod-<lb/>
ernist advocacy. But the work he presented in <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the Modern Landscape,</hi> enhanced by the drawings of Gordon Cullen, illustrates how in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s at Bent-<lb/>
ley Wood in Halland, East Sussex, the home of the architect Serge Chermayeff (<date when="1900">1900</date>&#x2013;<date when="1996">1996</date>), and in his own house at St. Ann's Hill, Chertsey (fig. 13.11), Tun-<lb/>
nard practiced the landscape modernism he preached.</p>
<p>The Chermayeff house of steel-framed, weath-<lb/>
erboarded construction, with expansive south walls of glass opening toward a distant rural view, had a ter-<lb/>
race sheltered by a plate-glass screen away from the house. For a year before the house was built, he care-<lb/>
fully removed trees in a second-growth woodland to open a view toward the distant horizon. He attempted no planting except for a mass of natural-<lb/>
ized daffodils, a few carefully grouped trees and shrubs near the house, and some narrow flower beds along the terrace edge and its sheltering wall. Near the far open corner of this protected sundeck, there was a sculpture of a reclining female by Henry Moore (<date when="1898">1898</date>&#x2013;<date when="1986">1986</date>), carefully positioned according to Tun-<lb/>
nard's principle of occult balance.</p>
<p>In prescribing a modern landscape style, Tun-<lb/>
nard expressed his own fundamental love of plants and scenery. Stripped of sentimental association, these were to be enjoyed, like abstract art, in terms of color, form, texture, and compositional balance. Whereas functionalist architects and planners usually paid little attention to horticulture, Tunnard urged that "[we] not let the humanism of the gardener's philosophy depart from us." At the same time, he saw the mod-<lb/>
ern landscape as a space to be enjoyed collectively, not "the hedged, personal, half-acre of today, but a unit of the broad green landscape itself, controlled for the benefit of all."<ref target="#CH13-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>It is remarkable just how principled was the spirit of early modernism with its frank avowal of machine-made materials and its honest and optimistic search for an aesthetic that served and expressed a new social order. Although later shorn of its youth-<lb/>
ful idealism, the exploration of the problem raised by modernism with regard to landscape design contin-<lb/>
ued in the belief that scientifically rational planning combined with an aesthetic of pure form and new spatial concepts could serve as expressive ends in themselves, replacing older cultural values emanat-<lb/>
ing from cosmology, religion, philosophy, horticul-<lb/>
ture, and history. And, much as the Becks had suspected when they saw the work of Le Corbusier and his followers as being more appropriately situ-<lb/>
ated in <name type="place">South America</name> than in Millbrook, <name type="place">New York</name>, it was in Brazil, where a significant spark&#x2014;the Sao Paulo Modern Art Week of <date when="1922">1922</date>&#x2014;had ignited a remarkable cultural and aesthetic revolution, that the modernist landscape in collaboration with modern architecture found one of its most creative exponents.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Roberto Burle Marx</name> (<date when="1909">1909</date>&#x2013;<date when="1994">1994</date>) was a protean artist&#x2014;painter, sculptor, muralist, and craftsman&#x2014; with an affinity for nature and the baroque mor-<lb/>
phology of the tropical vegetation of his native Brazil. Given the opportunity to collaborate with architects who were modernist innovators, he found his most expressive m&#x00E9;tier as a landscape designer. His approach to landscape paralleled his approach to painting; he employed a graphic style that treated the ground plane in the same abstract manner as Le N&#x00F4;tre or Capability Brown had but with a modernist sensibility sympathetic to the undulating lines and biomorphic shapes found in the art of Jean Arp, Joan Mir&#x00F3;, and Alexander Calder. The strong curvilinear forms of the Brazilian coastal landscape around Rio de Janeiro coincidentally echoed the biomorphic forms found in their work, and this native scenery had an obvious effect on Burle Marx as a designer. With a scientist's curiosity and an unrivaled botanical col-<lb/>
lection from his own expeditions in the Brazilian hin-<lb/>
terlands, he confidently deployed luxuriant, vividly colored tropical plants, some with highly architec-<lb/>
tonic forms, in visually strong compositions that evoked and often directly echoed the local landscape, drawing it into the garden in the manner of Japanese "borrowed" scenery. This style effectively comple-<lb/>
mented and enriched the austere lines of functional-<lb/>
ist buildings.</p>
<p>In <date when="1934">1934</date>, at the inviation of Lima Cavalcanti, the governor of the state of Pernambuco, Burle Marx accepted a job in Recife redesigning and restoring the public gardens of that faded provincial capital. Dur-<lb/>
ing his two-year sojourn in Recife, Burle Marx became an active member of the city's intellectual commu-<lb/>
nity, making friends and establishing lasting relation-<lb/>
ships among a group of young poets, painters, writers, and musicians. He developed his graphic approach to garden design as he prepared India ink perspectives of several public squares and parks, including the Euclides da Cunha Square (<date when="1935">1935</date>), which he envisioned as a cactus garden (fig. 13.12). For this project he went into the dry northeastern region of Brazil called the <hi rend="italic">caatinga</hi> to collect various kinds of succulents, which he then arranged and installed.</p>

</figure>
<p>Burle Marx's participation in a coterie with left-<lb/>
ist views caused him to fall into disfavor with the mayor, prompting his resignation and return to Rio in <date when="1937">1937</date>. There he set up an atelier and resumed con-<lb/>
tact with his friends from the School of Fine Arts. The architect L&#x00FA;cio Costa (b. <date when="1902">1902</date>) had invited Le Cor-<lb/>
busier to come to Rio to advise on the design of a new building for the Ministry of Education and Public Health, a controversial early modernist structure where Burle Marx assisted the well-known artist C&#x00E2;n-<lb/>
ido Portinari (<date when="1903">1903</date>&#x2013;<date when="1962">1962</date>) in painting a large mural
<pb n="445"/>
<pb n="445" type="orig"/>
representing the economic cycles of Brazil. Probably at Costa's suggestion, Burle Marx was asked to also participate on the architectural design team, which included, in addition to Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and several other young Brazilian modernists. Burle Marx was put in charge of designing the ground-level plaza, the minister's office terrace garden, and a roof gar-<lb/>
den. This last occupied the top of the low-rise section of the building and therefore functioned as an old-<lb/>
fashioned <hi rend="italic">parterre,</hi> being designed for viewing from above, in this case from the windows of the raised slab housing the offices of the ministry.</p>
<p>The gardens for the Ministry of Education and Public Health demonstrated Burle Marx's method of treating the garden plane in a manner analogous to a painter's canvas. Upon the roof garden, for instance, he "drew" curvilinear abstract forms reminiscent of aerial views of Brazilian rivers. Texture and color played important roles. There were spiky bird-of-<lb/>
paradise plants and other plants&#x2014;agaves, dracaenas, and palms&#x2014;laid out as sculptural accents or single masses of color. His approach to landscape design as aestheticized nature was essentially the same as his approach to painting. "My message is purely picto-<lb/>
rial," he once declared, "it revolves around color, rhythm, and form, trying to abstain from the anec-<lb/>
dotal, believing that pictorial language begins when the word loses the reason for being."<ref target="#CH13-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Burle Marx's vision of the modernist garden as pure visual experience unencumbered by textual meaning can be appreciated in both the gouache plan and the realized landscape of the Odette Monteiro Garden (now the Luiz Cezar Fernandes Garden) in Correas in the state of <name type="pname">Rio de Janeiro</name> (<date when="1948">1948</date>) (figs. 13.13, 13.14, 13.15). Although he often worked in close collaboration with modern architects, he was unlike the garden formalists who followed Reginald Blom-<lb/>
field's prescription for integrating house and garden in a unified, axially coordinated scheme, or such land-<lb/>
scape modernists as Tunnard, who wished to do the same thing in an asymmetrical manner. Instead, he saw garden design as a generally independent, nonar-<lb/>
chitectural, <hi rend="italic">contrapuntal,</hi> and primarily artistic endeavor. On the Monteiro estate, he virtually ignored the house by Wladimir Alves Souza. His aim here was to reiterate in certain ground plane forms the profile of the surrounding mountainscape.</p>

<p>By the time Burle Marx designed the Odette Monteiro Garden, the landscape design and con-<lb/>
struction business he was running with his brother Siegfried had grown. In addition, he wanted space for his expanding botanical collection and the nursery where the brothers propagated and grew plants for the firm's projects. In <date when="1949">1949</date>, they were able to purchase a former coffee plantation, S&#x00ED;tio Santo Antonio da Bica (Saint Anthony of the Spring), in Campo Grande, nineteenmiles south of Rio. On this hilly site offering a series of microclimates, he installed his collection of tropical plants, which was becoming one of out-<lb/>
standing scientific merit, thanks to his friendship and collaboration with Henrique Llahmeyer de Mello Barreto, a botanist and the head of Rio's zoological garden, with whom he undertook several phytogeo-<lb/>
graphical excursions into the Brazilian interior. At the

S&#x00ED;tio&#x2014;now his weekend home, painting studio, and horticultural laboratory&#x2014;he grew bromeliads, calatheas, philodendrons, anthuriums, and heliconia in shade houses. On higher ground, above the remod-<lb/>

<p>Although a knowledgeable plantsman and com-<lb/>
mitted environmentalist concerned about the pro-<lb/>
tection of the rain forest, art was for Burle Marx a more fundamental interest than science, for it was as an artist that he sought to use individually interesting plant species as a means of establishing accents, fill-<lb/>
ing the biomorphic outlines of his planting beds, and shaping space. It was as an artist, too, that he salvaged bits of old architectural fabric from buildings that were being torn down as Rio's modernization rushed forward, and these he recomposed within the gardens of the S&#x00ED;tio (fig. 13.16). Here, where the slightly men-<lb/>
acing air of tropical fecundity is interwoven with these enigmatic and melancholy-seeming fragments, one senses Burle Marx's affinity for Surrealism.<ref target="#CH13-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The same spirit of improvisational protean cre-<lb/>
ativity that characterized life at the S&#x00ED;tio also pervaded Burle Marx's office in Rio where he presided like a Renaissance <hi rend="italic">capo di bottega</hi> over an artisans' workshop. From here flowed floral decorations for receptions, sculptures, murals, jewelry, textile designs, and stage sets as well as more than 2,000 plans for various land-<lb/>
scapes and cityscapes. Although he achieved some of his finest results as a collaborator with modern archi-<lb/>
tects such as Rino Levi with whom he designed the estate of the industrialist Olivo Gomes, in Sao Jos&#x00E9; dos Campos, Sao Paulo, he remained as interested as he had been as a young park designer in Recife in applying his modernist landscape approach to public spaces. In <date when="1954">1954</date>, he received a commission for the 289-<lb/>
acre Flamengo Park on landfill adjacent to Guanabara Bay near the heart of Rio. Like the recreational facil-<lb/>
ities that were built in conjunction with the water-<lb/>
front parkways of <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>, Flamengo Park was undertaken as part of a coastal highway project designed to relieve the city's growing automobile con-<lb/>
gestion. Burle Marx executed his plan with charac-<lb/>
teristic boldness, engendering a visual dialogue between the park and the baroque landforms that rim the city and its bay.</p>
<p>In <date when="1970">1970</date>, in a second landfill project, he extended his work along Rio's coastline with his design for the promenades and parkways along Copacabana Beach (fig. 13.17). Here, for the palm-tree-edged promenade, he employed a traditional Portuguese paving tech-<lb/>
nique <hi rend="italic">(pedra portuguesa)</hi> to create a black, white, and red mosaic that echoes the undulating line of the nearby surf. In contrast, he designed the roadbed median and sidewalk along the building edge as a series of individually conceived abstract panels with green planting pockets set at irregular intervals within them. The entire strip, including the sandy bathing beach, was thus transformed into a vibrant linear <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> for viewing from the windows of the con-<lb/>
tiguous skyscraper hotels and apartment buildings.</p>
<p>In <date when="1956">1956</date>, the planning of <name type="place">Brazil</name>'s new capital, Bras&#x00ED;lia, began. Many were dismayed that for politi-<lb/>
cal reasons officials did not consult Burle Marx dur-<lb/>
ing the initial planning of this exercise in modernist urban design. Finally, in <date when="1965">1965</date>, he received a commis-<lb/>
sion to work with the architect Oscar Niemeyer on designs for the gardens of the Min-<lb/>
istries of the Army, Justice, and Foreign Affairs. Here as elsewhere he exploited the reflective qualities of pools of water and his own fertile imagination to good effect. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for instance, he reached beyond images derived from Brazil's colonial past to
<pb n="447"/>
<pb n="447" type="orig"/>
ones from the Roman colonial past of its mother country, Portugal, drawing upon the gardens of an excavated Roman house in Conimbriga as inspiration for his floating planting beds (figs. 13.18, 13.19).</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Luis Barrag&#x00E1;n and the Landscape of Surrealist Expressionism</hi></head>
<p>Burle Marx developed a visually dynamic style that was an abstract, organic counterpoint to the modern architecture within or adjacent to it, a style only slightly tinged with Surrealism. His contemporary, the Mexican architect Luis Barrag&#x00E1;n (<date when="1902">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1988">1988</date>), with starker Surrealist affinities and more influenced by American regionalist modernism as represented by Frank Lloyd Wright and certain Californian archi-<lb/>
tects, forged an expressive style that wedded domes-<lb/>
tic space with raw, even violent, nature.</p>
<p>Trained in his native Guadalajara, Barrag&#x00E1;n trav-<lb/>
eled for a year and a half in Europe and then left his home city to establish himself in the capital in <date when="1936">1936</date>. He carried with him remembered images from his sojourn in Europe&#x2014;Surrealist paintings, Islamic patios in Spain, and the idyllic Mediterranean gardens of the writer, caricaturist, and illustrator Ferdinand Bac (<date when="1859">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1952">1952</date>) at Les Colombi&#x00E8;res in Menton, <name type="place">France</name>. At Les Colombi&#x00E8;res on the C&#x00F4;te d'Azure, Bac had employed a pastiche of vaguely allusive Mediter-<lb/>
ranean forms in which an Arts and Crafts approach and an Italianate stylistic sensibility were mingled to create a garden of memory and meditation.<ref target="#CH13-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref>Barrag&#x00E1;n, in a similar manner, gave his gardens a certain dreamlike character, imbuing them with memories of vernacular Mexican architecture and the rural land-<lb/>
scape he had known as a child on his family's ranch near the village of Mazamitla. Working in a climate similar to Bac's Mediterranean, he created an archi-<lb/>
tecture that completely fused interior and exterior spatial planning. Thoroughly abreast of modernist developments in his profession, Bar-<lb/>
rag&#x00E1;n forged an indigenous style devoid of stylistic specificity, a spare, stripped-down version of his native architecture that owed a strong debt to the influence of the Bauhaus and Le Corbusier. He particularly wished to avoid designing in the popular "<name type="place">California</name> Colonial" idiom of ornate stucco and red tiles that some affluent Mex-<lb/>
icans had begun to favor.</p>
<p>The practice he established in Mexico City was as a designer-developer, and he built about thirty, mostly speculative houses and small apartment buil-<lb/>
dings during his first four years there. With profits from these, he purchased and remodeled for himself a house in the Tacubaya district, for which he created a garden. He also created behind high buttressed, red-<lb/>
earth-colored walls a strange and enigmatic garden of "aestheticized desolation and decay"<ref target="#CH13-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref>in San Angel on a property called El Cabr&#x00ED;o at the edge of the Pedre-<lb/>
gal, the lava field south of Mexico City. Before the volcanic eruption of Xictli around 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.,</hi> this was the site of the Aztec ceremonial centers of Cuicuilco and Copilco. Because of its contorted topography, peculiar plant life, and the eerie legends associated with its weird basaltic landscape, the Pedregal was considered by respectable people as a place to be avoided. But Barrag&#x00E1;n's taste for the surreal attracted him to explore and then, beginning in <date when="1944">1944</date>, to buy 865 acres (later increased to 1,250) of this inex-<lb/>
pensive wasteland where he had decided to create a unique modernist garden suburb for prosperous mid-<lb/>
dle-class Mexicans.</p>
<p>With lots one-acre minimum in size, houses occupying no more than 10 percent of the entire area of the subdivision, lava rock and indigenous plant life
<pb n="448"/>
<pb n="448" type="orig"/>
protected from removal, and roads laid out to con-<lb/>
form with the terrain, the San Angel Gardens of the Pedregal were to constitute a Surrealistic celebration of the violent inhuman forces that reside in the larger Mexican landscape. Asserting possession of this land-<lb/>
scape, which bore no trace of colonial occupation but evoked a pre-catastrophe Aztec empire, was also symbolically important at a time when Mexican intellec-<lb/>
tuals, artists, and political leaders were concerned with issues of national identity. To choose a site such as this for domestic purposes was, like Wright's choice of a cantilevered platform over Bear Run for <name type="pname">Edgar J. Kaufmann</name>'s Fallingwater, to state a modernist's con-<lb/>
fidence in technology, even in the face of nature's tur-<lb/>
bulence. It affirmed the idea that humans had reached a point where nature had become a subject of desire and personal dominion rather than an object of awe or admiration. Landscape in this sense meant an inti-<lb/>
mate coupling of architecture and nat-<lb/>
ure. There would be no transition from the artificial to the natural environment through an intermediate zone in which the traditional skills of garden design and hor-<lb/>
ticulture played a significant part.<ref target="#CH13-n24"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">24</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Although the winding streets of El Pedregal were similar to those of nineteenth- and twentieth-<lb/>
century suburbs in the United States, the continuous front lawns of the typical North American suburb were replaced, in conformity with a Mediterranean-<lb/>
derived Latin American tradition, by high walls at the line of the street or sidewalk. For Barrag&#x00E1;n these walls offered opportunities to create slightly mysterious "garden-streets" with "sex appeal."<ref target="#CH13-n25"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">25</hi></hi></ref>The houses behind these walls, however, were rational, function-<lb/>
alist essays in modernism. In their cubic massing, flat roofs, concrete construction, expansive picture win-<lb/>
dows, open floor plans, and interpenetration of indoors and outdoors, they echoed current architec-<lb/>
tural modernism in Europe, the United States, <name type="place">Japan</name>, and other parts of Latin America. Instead of enclos-<lb/>
ing a landscaped patio in the manner of countless Mediterranean-style exemplars, these houses were made simply to emerge out of the rugged landscape (fig. 13.20). In discussing their design of one of the Pedregal properties, Barrag&#x00E1;n's collaborator, Max Cetto, spoke of the lava ridge that partially defined the edge of the swimming pool and all but dove into the living room as "the master key" that "made the house click."<ref target="#CH13-n26"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">26</hi></hi></ref>Here, instead of the house's extending into the landscape by means of axial relationships, the land-<lb/>
scape appears to be extending itself into the house.</p>
<p>Cetto was a German emigr&#x00E9; modernist, and the style of functionalist architecture that he and Bar-<lb/>
rag&#x00E1;n professed, with its smooth, unadorned, white, planar surfaces, contrasted powerfully with the tor-<lb/>
tuous dark-gray basalt. The same mixture of spare, open-plan modernism and dramatic siting can be found in the work of the Austrian-born American architect Richard Neutra (<date when="1892">1892</date>&#x2013;<date when="1970">1970</date>), especially in the house he designed in <date when="1946">1946</date> for <name type="pname">Edgar J. Kaufmann</name> in Palm Springs, <name type="place">California</name> (fig. 13.21). Barrag&#x00E1;n knew of the developments in modern architecture in <name type="place">California</name> and had established a personal friendship with Neutra. Cali-<lb/>
fornian landscape architects such as Thomas Church and Garrett Eckbo were forging a regional modernism that drew upon factors similar to those in Mexico: Hispanic cultural heritage, starkly beautiful natural scenery, and a climate that fostered luxuriant vegetation. Barrag&#x00E1;n's residential landscapes were meant to be, like theirs, private realms in which modernism was informed by vernacular traditions, places where garden and house merged to accom-<lb/>
modate an informal lifestyle, and spaces of refuge and retreat from the turmoil of modern life.</p>
<p>This is eloquently evident at San Cristobal, an estate on the outskirts of Mexico City where Thor-<lb/>
oughbred horses are raised and trained (fig. 13.22). Barrag&#x00E1;n's only remaining legacy that has not been severely altered, this complex of house, swimming pool, stable, and horse pool is a poetic meditation on his childhood memories of the rural village of Maza-<lb/>
mitla, as well as an abstract composition of great sophistication and refinement in which color plays a role similar to that in the works of Color Field
<pb n="449"/>
<pb n="449" type="orig"/>
painters such as Mark Rothko (<date when="1903">1903</date>&#x2013;<date when="1970">1970</date>). Here as elsewhere the architect gave his austere, unorna-<lb/>
mented architecture warmth and animation as well as a Surrealist intensity by his use brilliant pinks and fuchsias against which the complementary green tones of the landscape act as a foil.</p>
<p>In terms of physical climate and a cultural cli-<lb/>
mate hospitable to bold gestures and innovation, Mex-<lb/>
ico and southern <name type="place">California</name> are closely related. Both places are conducive to the use of a Mediterranean plant palette and the interweaving of indoor and out-<lb/>
door space found in Mediterranean lands. The patio of Spain, with its debt to Islamic models, and the log-<lb/>
gia and casino of <name type="place">Italy</name>, where villa owners had pio-<lb/>
neered the art of open-air dining and entertaining, were forerunners of the paved, well-furnished garden court and terrace with pool and adjacent lanai.</p>
<p>In <name type="place">California</name>, in the altered economic and social structure of the post&#x2014;Great Depression years, an informal way of life stressing low maintenance require-<lb/>
ments, casual dress, easy hospitality on the part of hosts without servants, and a proclivity for home-<lb/>

nia</name>, and directed to western homeowners, promoted this agreeable mode of living and the flow between indoors and outdoors that it implied.

<p>Thomas Church (<date when="1902">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1978">1978</date>) grew up in southern <name type="place">Cal-<lb/>
ifornia</name>. He earned a landscape architecture degree from the University of <name type="place">California</name> at <name type="place">Berkeley</name> in <date when="1922">1922</date>, pursued further studies at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and traveled extensively, studying Spanish and Italian garden design on a six-month fel-<lb/>
lowship in <date when="1927">1927</date>. Thus trained in the prevailing Beaux-<lb/>
Arts curriculum, he began a long and successful practice centered primarily upon residential land-<lb/>
scapes, receiving commissions in both the Bay Area and southern <name type="place">California</name>. Florence Yoch (<date when="1890">1890</date>&#x2013;<date when="1972">1972</date>) had begun to transform her style of eclectic original-<lb/>
ity into one that was more abstract and informal with the design in <date when="1936">1936</date> of a poolside garden for the film director George Cukor. Church, like Yoch, was capa-<lb/>
ble of making traditional-style gardens that were aes-<lb/>
thetically pleasing and functionally satisfying, which is what he did for a growing roster of clients through-<lb/>
out the <date when="1930">1930</date>s. Like Yoch, he realized that a landscape designer could make a virtue of a small lot by ignor-<lb/>
ing the tenets of his training and adopting the aesthetic principles being pioneered by modern architects and artists. On a second visit to Europe in <date when="1937">1937</date> he saw the work of Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto (<date when="1898">1898</date>&#x2013;<date when="1976">1976</date>) as well as that of many modern painters and sculptors.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late <date when="1930">1930</date>s, Church began to employ line, color, and texture in a bold and original manner. His use of shifting, asymmetrical axes rather than the balanced, geometrically oriented ones of Neo-<lb/>
classical design gave him the freedom to organize space in new ways. He became a master at harmonizing the angular geometries of architectural design with flow-<lb/>
ing, curvilinear forms. A beach garden in Aptos, <name type="place">Cali-<lb/>
fornia</name>, shows clearly his understanding of ground-plane line as a means of defining space in a manner that energizes both the delineated, contained area and the more natural surrounding terrain (fig. 13.23). At this Pacific Coast beach house designed by Hervey Parke Clark, Church merged interior and exte-<lb/>
rior space so skillfully that he earned a reputation among architects as an ideal collaborator on site planning. As attentive to the lives and desires of his clients as to the conditions of the site, he conceived plans that were both functional and artistic. The pattern and tex-<lb/>
ture of paving or decking and the manner in which the texture, scale, and structure of plants unite hard and soft surfaces is the hallmark of a Church landscape.</p>
<p>Church's first book, <hi rend="italic">Gardens Are for People</hi> (<date when="1955">1955</date>), adopts the tone of a professional offering common-<lb/>
sense advice to homeowners. It gives excellent instruc-<lb/>
tion on how to appreciate visually the natural assets of a property and how to make the most of it by ori-<lb/>

sures, while considering scenic view lines, topogra-<lb/>
phy, and existing vegetation. Church pointed out how things had changed within a single generation: Garages had been absorbed into the house; drinks on the terrace had replaced tea in the parlor; modest attire had given way to bikini sunbathing; the circular carriage-turnaround entry court had been replaced by the automobile driveway; a service area for prop-<lb/>
agating and potting plants and composting weeds had become a requirement in an era of do-it-yourself gar-<lb/>
deners; gunite and plastic swimming pools had made a former luxury commonplace; and plant-filled nurs-<lb/>
eries and a scientific horticultural industry had grown up to serve the average homeowner. The prescrip-<lb/>
tions he offered stress the means of integrating house and garden so that they constitute a unified living space. They continually directed attention to the func-<lb/>
tional requirements of the entire family and its guests.</p>

</figure>
<p>With the increasing popularity of home enter-<lb/>
tainment, Church sought to dramatize the point of arrival even in modest houses, stressing the role of attractive forecourt paving and planting as a means of welcoming guests. He also believed that a gener-<lb/>
ous scale for the vestibule would signal the hospital-<lb/>
ity visitors were to receive as they proceeded into the the house and its garden. Increasing the house's ambi-<lb/>
ence of cordiality sometimes involved removing heavy foundation plantings to give it a cleaner, more inviting appearance. Conscious of maintenance requirements in an era of rising labor costs, Church configured gardens with open centers and broad strips of grass that could be easily mowed.</p>
<p><name type="place">California</name>'s climate made the swimming pool an especially appealing garden amenity and its sur-<lb/>
rounding paved area a center for family life and entertaining friends outdoors. Church's best known work, the Donnell Garden in Sonoma, which he designed in <date when="1948">1948</date>, contains a kidney-shaped swim-<lb/>

<p>Modern sculpture, like modern painting, served as an inspiration for early modernist landscape archi-<lb/>
tects like Church, who were seeking a new vocabu-<lb/>

Ever pragmatic and people-oriented in his approach, Church made the sculptural feature he placed in the Donnell Garden swimming pool appear to be an afterthought. "The first idea was to use one of the big boulders from the site as a play island in the pool," Church explained. "This was changed (the rock would have torn the swimmers to pieces) into an

<p>Church remained stylistically versatile, always taking his cues from the client, considering his or her preferences, personal and family requirements, and the conditions of the site. He never entirely aban-<lb/>
doned his Beaux-Arts training, employing past styles or motifs as he deemed appropriate and in response to his clients' tastes. For some of his Bay Area clients living in town houses as well as those in Santa Bar-<lb/>
bara where there was a strong Italianate and Spanish Colonial design tradition, he drew upon his know-<lb/>
ledge of historic landscape idioms (fig. 13.26). Though destined, like Fletcher Steele, by the culture and edu-<lb/>
cation of his time to straddle two design eras, he nevertheless transformed himself into a modernist of conviction, sharing many of the ideas of a slightly younger generation of land-<lb/>
scape architects that included fellow Californian Garrett Eckbo.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Garrett Eckbo's Landscapes for Living</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Garret Eckbo</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="2000">2000</date>) grew up in a town on Alameda Island in <name type="place">San Francisco</name> Bay. He studied landscape architecture at the University of <name type="place">California</name> in <name type="place">Berkeley</name> and Harvard's School of Graduate Design. At Harvard he met Daniel Urban Kiley and James Rose, classmates who were, like him, sufficiently pro-<lb/>
gressive in their social attitudes to sense that the pro-<lb/>
gram they were being offered was designed to serve the demands of a dwindling elite and did not deal with the needs of an industrialized, democratic soci-<lb/>
ety. Joseph Hudnut, the dean of the school, had recently brought Walter Gropius (<date when="1883">1883</date>&#x2013;<date when="1969">1969</date>) to head the architecture department, and with him the teach-<lb/>
ing agenda of the Bauhaus, with its emphasis upon large social issues and the abandonment of historic styles for functionalist design and industrial materi-<lb/>
als. However, the landscape architecture department at Harvard retained its Beaux-Arts curriculum, which Henry Hubbard and Theodora Kimball's textbook, <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design</hi> had codified in <date when="1917">1917</date>.<ref target="#CH13-n29"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">29</hi></hi></ref>As Reuben Rainey points out, Hub-<lb/>
bard and Kimball's method united several approaches. It called for Beaux-Arts, or formal, planning as a means of uniting house and garden along continuing axes, then recommended an Olmstedian naturalistic, or informal, design for the remainder of the property, often as a means of melding it with the larger land-<lb/>
scape. A transitional lawn was proposed to mediate the stylistic contrast between these zones.</p>
<p>Eckbo was inspired by his own sense of possi-<lb/>
bilities derived from living and working in a less tra-<lb/>
dition-bound atmosphere than the Atlantic seaboard and by the current Zeitgeist&#x2014;a heady mixture of jazz, film, fashion, industrial design, New Deal social progressiveness, the recently arrived automobile cul-<lb/>
ture, and the growing acceptance of European mod-<lb/>
ern art and architecture in America. Like his friends Rose and Kiley, he worked diligently while chafing at the limitations of Harvard's conservative approach to landscape architecture. The three probably read with keen interest the articles of the well-traveled Fletcher Steele, whose descriptions of modernist French gardens opened a window upon innovative alternatives to their program of study. They formed a receptive audience for Christopher Tunnard's <hi rend="italic">Gar-<lb/>
dens in the Modern Landscape</hi> when it appeared in <date when="1938">1938</date>.</p>
<p>Eckbo saw the potential of landscape design for serving a middle-class clientele. He thought of the modest row house and the suburban subdivision with its small front yards and backyards as interesting chal-<lb/>
lenges, and he was skilled at manipulating spatial organization to maximize the visual interest and pleas-<lb/>
urable use of an entire property. He explored these possibilities while still at Harvard in a student project comprising a city block of eighteen equal-size town-<lb/>
house lots in which he demonstrated a synthesis of curvilinearity and angularity similar to the one found in Church's Aptos beach house. Landscape historian Marc Treib draws an instructive parallel between Eckbo's compositions and the work of the modern painters Wassily Kandinsky (<date when="1866">1866</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944">1944</date>), Kasimir Malevich (<date when="1878">1878</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935">1935</date>), and L&#x00E1;szl&#x00F3; Moholy-Nagy (<date when="1895">1895</date>&#x2014;<date when="1946">1946</date>).<ref target="#CH13-n30"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">30</hi></hi></ref>The cheerful, Jazz Age rhythms and explosive visual energy set up by the counterplay of geometric and "organic" lines and shapes in their paintings could inspire someone who wanted to sub-<lb/>
stitute the shaping of space as a central compositional principle for the arrangement of views along static, single-perspective axes. In borrowing the free-flowing
<pb n="452"/>
<pb n="452" type="orig"/>
lines of abstract painting for his plans Eckbo found a means of creating a sense of mobile dynamism in the landscape, which had been impossible within the con-<lb/>
fines of Beaux-Arts spatial composition.</p>
<p>At the same time, the inspiration of architecture as derived from Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavil-<lb/>
ion remained influential in Eckbo's work.<ref target="#CH13-n31"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">31</hi></hi></ref>With its grid of eight cruciform columns set on a raised ter-<lb/>
race, the Barcelona Pavilion organizes space in a way that is clear and yet ambiguous. Here, Mies established a modular system that performed the functions of framing the structure and supporting the roof, giving underlying mathematical order to the building, and at the same time freely modulating the interior space by positioning non-load-bearing walls as freestanding screens, articulating occupational zones without defining them precisely. The spatial continuum thus created gives an impression of uninterrupted flow. This type of construction also made possible the cur-<lb/>
tain wall composed of panels of glass or a combina-<lb/>
tion of glass and opaque cladding hung in front of a steel frame. Because space is contained but not defined within these glass walls, there is no unequivocal sep-<lb/>
aration between indoors and outdoors and no single point within the building that can be called its center.</p>
<p>Eckbo returned to <name type="place">California</name> to establish his practice, and at Menlo Park, where he designed a gar-<lb/>
den in <date when="1940">1940</date>, he acknowledged his debt to Mies, plac-<lb/>
ing straight and curvilinear hedges in a manner he termed "a kind of de Stijl-van der Rohe planning," which served as a means of "baffling of garden space ... to increase sense of volume" (fig. 13.27).<ref target="#CH13-n32"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">32</hi></hi></ref> As in Mies's Barcelona Pavilion, the garden has an ordering geometric grid&#x2014;the pear orchard into which it was set&#x2014;and well-emphasized rectangular boundaries.</p>

</figure>
<p>Above all, like Church, Eckbo wanted to focus on domestic human needs and the humanized land-<lb/>
scape that was expanding with the population growth of <name type="place">California</name>. He called his first book <hi rend="italic">Landscape for Liv-<lb/>
ing.</hi> Published in <date when="1950">1950</date> when his reputation was well established and illustrated with the work of his office, it implied the role of human beings as partners with nature, realizing their legitimate needs through sci-<lb/>
ence and technology rather than basing their spatial arrangements upon historic styles reflecting the aspi-<lb/>
rations and needs of people in other times and places.</p>
<p>After returning to <name type="place">California</name> and before setting up a private practice, Eckbo had worked for more than four years for the Farm Security Administration designing fifty landscape plans for camps built to house 225 to 350 families of migrant and permanent agricultural workers. His concern for ordinary humanity was expressed in this context in the inter-<lb/>
esting spatial arrangements and varied palette of veg-<lb/>
etation he provided, which probably offered some greater sense of place and therefore an element of psychological comfort to the populations living in the otherwise unremarkable surroundings of the camps of trailers and spartan temporary housing. <hi rend="italic">Landscape for Living</hi> illustrates his plans for several of these camps along with some of his designs for single-family resi-<lb/>
dences, campuses, parks, and tract-housing, selected from a portfolio that amounted to more than a thou-<lb/>
sand commissions during his years of practice.</p>
<p>As subsequently developed by Ian <name type="pname">McHarg</name> and the landscape planners he trained at the University of Pennsylvania, one approach to landscape architecture was through environmental science (see Chapter Fif-<lb/>
teen). For Eckbo and other landscape functionalists of his generation, science was more a matter of pro-<lb/>
fessional perspective, a questioning approach to design problems, the discipline of asking the theo-<lb/>
retical "why" as well as the practical "how." Wishing to advocate no style and to be an heir to all historic styles, Eckbo created his own design vocabulary to express the dynamic aspect of modernity, his prefer-<lb/>
ence for areal over axial design, and his commitment to democratic values. Even in such structures as gar-<lb/>
den pavilions, his emphasis was upon space, not mass. He saw plants as upthrusting verticals, sculptural objects, and vegetative texture, and for him they were a means of defining space, not an end in themselves. By contrast, he saw rocks as being pulled by gravity toward the center of the earth, and he sometimes used groupings of these to anchor and stabilize parts of his design. Like Church and other landscape archi-<lb/>
tects in <name type="place">California</name>, he designed many pools in the shape of amoebas, kidneys, and boomerangs. In his designs the pool became "a positive space-organizing element which controls physical movement."<ref target="#CH13-n33"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">33</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In <date when="1956">1956</date>, when the Aluminum Corporation of <name type="place">America</name> (Alcoa) asked Eckbo to develop a landscape plan promoting the use of this modern metal in the garden, he decided to create the Aluminum Garden
<pb n="453"/>
<pb n="453" type="orig"/>
on his own property in Wonderland Park, a subdivi-<lb/>
sion in the Hollywood Hills above Laurel Canyon. The subdivision was situated on a steeply terraced slope, and Eckbo's contribution to its planning resulted in successive layers of vegetation along the side of the canyon and a unified appearance rather than the fragmented look characteristic of other suburban devel-<lb/>
opments. Until his death in <date when="2000">2000</date>, Eckbo remained a fierce and opinionated advocate of the "social-cultural-<lb/>
natural approach" to landscape design.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel Urban Kiley's Synthesis of FRenCH Influence and Miesian Modernism</hi></head>
<p>In contrast to Eckbo, whose experimental approach to landscape architecture was fostered by the inno-<lb/>
vative, freewheeling culture of <name type="place">California</name> and by his commitment to low-cost housing for the mass soci-<lb/>
ety, <name type="pname">Daniel Urban Kiley</name> (b. <date when="1912">1912</date>) became increasingly drawn to Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre's principles of French sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century garden design. This was apparent after <date when="1955">1955</date> when <name type="pname">Mr. and Mrs. J. Irwin Miller</name> chose him to work in collaboration with architect <name type="pname">Eero Saarinen</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1961">1961</date>) on the design of their house and garden in Columbus, Indiana (fig. 13.28). Posted overseas in <date when="1945">1945</date> during his military duty, Kiley was able to tour European gardens for the first time, and his exposure to the masterpieces of Le Notre made a lasting impression upon him. At the same time, he shared with his former classmates Eckbo and Rose a reverential fascination with the Barcelona Pavilion.</p>
<p>In <date when="1955">1955</date>, when hired by the Millers to work with his friend Saarinen, Kiley had already been practicing for nineteen years, using a vocabulary of multiple, shifting axes and free-form, nonorthogonal, areal def-<lb/>
initions similar to that of Eckbo and Rose. Now, hav-<lb/>
ing discovered his affinity for Le N&#x00F4;tre and being given the opportunity to work with an architect who shared his appreciation of Mies van der Rohe's asymmetrical but rhythmically balanced way of organizing space by means of freestanding walls set in overlapping planes within a modular grid, he changed course.<ref target="#CH13-n34"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">34</hi></hi></ref>Hence-<lb/>
forth, he practiced a form of modern landscape archi-<lb/>
tecture that married the classical geometrical planning principles of the French master with the dynamically ambiguous yet elegantly ordered spatial concepts of the German architect. In Mies's work architectural space had the appearance of being no longer con-<lb/>
tained. Space for Mies was an infinity-implying cont-<lb/>
inuum similar to that of Le N&#x00F4;tre's gardens, whose axes were metaphors for Descartes's principle of <hi rend="italic">res extensa,</hi> or the indefinite extension of the universe (see Chapter Five). As landscape architect Gregg Bleam points out, "Perhaps more than any other architect of his time, Mies represented a synthesis of what would seem to be the conflicting conceptions of neoclassi-<lb/>
cism and modernism."<ref target="#CH13-n35"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">35</hi></hi></ref>Kiley, like Frank Lloyd Wright and Christopher Tunnard, found inspiration in Japan-<lb/>

<p>Organized as a series of separate but overlap-<lb/>
ping zones, Kiley's functional and ornamental garden spaces carry the centrifugal movement of Saarinen's plan for the house into the surrounding landscape. The house, placed within a large square of their com-<lb/>
bined grid plan, is defined on three sides by clipped arborvitae hedges planted in a staggered pattern rather than as a single continuous line. Around the house are

a series of geometrically ordered gardens reminiscent of the <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> and <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> of Le N&#x00F4;tre, but they do not employ Le N&#x00F4;tre's axial symmetries. Freely arranged within their own grid in a manner that complements Saarinen's pinwheel disposition of the elements of the house, these geometrical garden spaces flow fluidly and expand outward. To define the remaining side of the square Kiley placed a honey locust <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> adjacent to the house, with a platform terrace at either end for the display of sculpture (fig. 13.29).</p>

<p>For the platform terrace at the north end the Millers chose a reclining female figure in bronze by Henry Moore. At the other end of this <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e,</hi> they installed a sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz. Stairs lead down to a lawn that slopes toward the floodplain beside the Flatrock River. Trees planted both in regu-<lb/>
lar configurations and naturalistic clumps form walls on either side of the lawn. Some of the Miller garden's finest effects are due to the clients' horticultural knowl-<lb/>
edge, original plant selections, and intelligent replant-<lb/>
ing over the years. These include the entrance drive planted as an <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> of horse chestnuts to remind Miller of the chestnut <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> he had admired in French gar-<lb/>
dens when he was a graduate student in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s; the weeping beeches in the front entry and on the terrace on the western side of the living room where they serve the function of exterior draperies; the planting of a glen of redbud trees outside the dining room; the substitution of red maples for the row of sycamores in the <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> leading to the river; and the installation of willows, in the meadow near the water.</p>
<p>Kiley's cool reinterpretation of the Beaux-Arts French Neoclassical heritage along lines suggested by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe made him a logical partner for the high-style modern architects who received commissions to build prestigious build-<lb/>
ings that served as cor-<lb/>
porate status symbols. His important contributions in this area in the later years of his career illustrate the growing importance of corporations in shaping both the urban and suburban landscape and their financial ability to supersede local governments as providers of attractive public spaces. From General Motors to Pepsico to Disney to Exxon and Time-Life, big companies have played an increas-<lb/>
ingly large role both directly and indirectly in the devel-<lb/>
opment of the American landscape. Large institutions such as the Ford Foundation and Lincoln Center, both clients of Kiley's, have adopted the same understated Olympian grandeur as corporations in creating an image through architecture and landscape design</p>
<p>Within the discipline of an abstract geometri-<lb/>
cal order, Kiley seeks the sensuously grand gesture. Like his contemporary, <name type="pname">Lawrence Halprin</name> (see Chap-<lb/>
ter Fifteen), he is interested in extending the expres-<lb/>
sive potential of both still and animated water in reflecting pools, fountains, and cascades. His archi-<lb/>
tectural imagination and ability to think boldly in terms of scale and spatial arrangement are qualities that have made him a congenial collaborator with some of the most eminent architects of the twenti-<lb/>
eth century, including Louis Kahn, Eero Saarinen, <name type="pname">I. M. Pei</name>, and <name type="pname">Kevin Roche</name>. In <name type="place">Dallas</name>, <name type="place">Texas</name>, he worked with <name type="pname">Peter Ker Walker</name> in designing Fountain Place, a large water garden built in conjunction with the Pei firm's Allied Bank Tower (fig. 13.30). Here, he planted bald cypress trees in circular concrete tubs set accord-<lb/>
ing to a grid within a broadly stepped cascade, which is further animated by 263 bubbler fountains placed in staggered rows between the trees. The cooling effect and pleasant roar of the sparkling, tree-shaded water, together with a grid of fountain jets that play according to various computer-programmed patterns, have made this corporate gift of public space a much-<lb/>
appreciated popular attraction.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">James Rose's Functionalist and Zen Approach</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">James Rose</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1991">1991</date>) used a caustic pen and an original and deliberately unconventional eye to chal-<lb/>
lenge established taste and convention. He found a forum for his ideas in the magazine <hi rend="italic">Pencil Points</hi> (later <hi rend="italic">Progressive Architecture</hi>) where he coauthored three articles with <name type="pname">Kiley</name> and <name type="pname">Eckbo</name> and also submitted pieces of his own. The freshness of his opinionated prose and perspective on landscape design won him an instant sympathetic readership, especially among architects. Rose's mission throughout his career was to create an intimate relationship between human
<pb n="455"/>
<pb n="455" type="orig"/>
beings, nature, and architecture. This aspiration drew him into a close friendship with Christopher Tunnard. Like the architect Richard Neutra, Rose considered the separation between indoors and outdoors as a series of transparent planes, and his interlocking of exterior and interior forms promoted spatial fusion.</p>
<p>Rose compartmentalized garden space, always with a light hand to allow it visual flow. He did this sometimes with screens of modular wood-framed panels containing a plastic-impregnated wire mesh, sometimes with translucent plastic Japanese shoji screens, sometimes minimally with vertical strings of nylon parachute cord strung along a plane at intervals, sometimes with panels of twisted, slatted bamboo, or sometimes with the slender trunks of white birch trees (fig. 13.31). These screens filtered light and enriched the garden with their own pattern and that of silhou-<lb/>
etted tree branches. Overhead, Rose's trellises carried modular grid patterns into the garden, supporting vines and framing the sky Sometimes these extended horizontal roof lines; at others they acted as free-<lb/>
standing open-air awnings, which were often canted skyward, giving the garden a jaunty angularity. His ground-plane patterns and plant forms combined with those of the vertical and horizontal planes above to create a three-dimensional composition with a com-<lb/>
bination of spatial definition and ambiguity.</p>
<p>Rose had a craftsman's aesthetic sensibility and a spiritual bent, which he nourished by frequent trips to <name type="place">Japan</name>, and at home, by the practice of Zen Bud-<lb/>
dhism. The garden was, for him, both a functional space and a place for reverie. For this reason the pri-<lb/>
vate garden, not the large-scale landscape, was his cho-<lb/>
sen m&#x00E9;tier. With a less extensive practice than either Kiley or Eckbo, Rose's method of approaching each commission was a highly personal one and involved his presence on the site much more than at a drafting table. He liked to shape his landscapes improvisa-<lb/>
tionally, and he often participated in their long-term maintenance. No other modern landscape designer gave as much attention to ground-plane texture as Rose did, and his compositions in gravel, river-worn rocks, flagstones, ground covers, and shrubs are mas-<lb/>
terful essays in landscape craftsmanship (fig. 13.32).</p>
<p>In <date when="1952">1952</date>, Rose designed his own small house in Ridgewood, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>. He used it as a protest against the subsidiary role the landscape architect was usu-<lb/>
ally assigned by the architect and subdivision devel-<lb/>

<p>Society is influenced, but rarely led, by visionaries. The urge to regulate, systematize, and follow is too strong. Legislation creates town building codes, and banks and federally sponsored loan programs create require-<lb/>
ments for mortgage financing that stifle deviation from standardized norms. With some exceptions such as <name type="pname">James Rouse</name> (<date when="1915">1915</date>&#x2013;<date when="1996">1996</date>), the developers who shaped <name type="place">America</name> in the second half of the twentieth century proved to be much less socially minded than the regional planners and landscape architects of the first half, who believed in rational science as a <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> and industrial technology as a positive force for raising the living standards of society through good engineering and design. The dreams of these idealists were soon deflated by the arrival of a future much less agreeable than the one they had imagined. The media, perhaps the most culturally influential area of corpo-<lb/>
rate power, became a growing influence, urging peo-<lb/>
ple toward consumption, and popular entertainment became a mass industry affecting every corner of soci-<lb/>
ety. The manufacturers of the private automobile, the vanguard of consumer marketing, proved particularly adept at influencing government decision- making and the authorization of funding for highways. In the late twentieth century, private property as commodity, leisure as lifestyle, and the automobile as the domi-<lb/>
nant mode of transportation had a profound effect upon landscape, especially in America.</p>

Instead of the superfluous and detestable clothing of garden city roads and byways, the effect of which is always to destroy the site, we shall establish a fine arterial system running in concrete through the grass itself, and in the open country. Grass will border the roads; nothing will be disturbed&#x2014;neither the trees, the flowers, nor the flocks and herds. The dwellers in these houses, drawn hence through love of the life of the countryside, will be able to see it maintained intact from their hanging gardens or from their ample windows. Their domestic lives will be set within a Virgilian dream."</p>
<p>Here Le Corbusier does not consider who will maintain this Virgilian dream or how, as Tunnard is quick to point out, the larger landscape can be organized in rela-<lb/>
tionship with the house to accommodate the functional needs of human beings. Dryly, he wrote, "Few people want to be condemned to languish at a window and exercise exclusively on a roof garden." See Tunnard, op. cit., p. 79.</p></note>

Indeed, the security and exclusiveness of this gated, guarded community were among its major selling points; Barrag&#x00E1;n's advertising campaign for El Pedregal placed considerable emphasis on these issues and on those design features that addressed them."</p></note>

<figure xml:id="fig-567">
<graphic url="CH14_001.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>Consumption, or material self-gratification, is the engine that fuels many modern industrial economies. Consumerism directs much of the course of landscape design today. In addition, the notion of the nuclear family as the primary social unit for child rearing, replacing the extended family, the clan, the tribe, and the state, has resulted in the elevation to new status of the individual home and the plot of land upon which it sits. Indeed, no previous societies have ever focused so attentively as present Western ones upon defining a dedicated spatial realm for families and children. The culture of childhood and the realm of juvenile fantasy have increasingly informed our subject area during the past half century. <name type="pname">Jean Piaget</name> (<date when="1896">1896</date>&#x2013;<date when="1980">1980</date>) and other child psychologists brought new social awareness of the value and purposes of play in the forma-<lb/>
tion of human personality. This is manifested in the home yard with its swing set and wading pool and in numerous neighborhood parks and playgrounds.</p>
<p>The realization of the American dream of home ownership and the fulfillment of a pioneer spirit that had long been ingrained in the national temperament by settling a new urban frontier, the original Western one having vanished, brought real psychic rewards to millions of citizens. In transforming the middle landscape advo-<lb/>
cated by Downing and Olmsted in the nineteenth century as an ideal combination of civilization and nature into suburbia&#x2014;a place replete with both urban amenities and pastoral greenery but increasingly autonomous and independent of the metropolis to which it is only loosely tied&#x2014;they created a new kind of urbanism that theorists are still attempting to define. The patterns woven by the first weavers of the suburban fabric were far from exemplary as environmentalists, sociologists, and urban planners soon dis-<lb/>
overed. But for the young families in <name type="place">America</name> at the end of World War II the suburban subdivision was an attractive ready-made cloth, which they gladly bought and soon cut to fit.</p>
<p>If democratic capitalism and the consumer society furthered the American ideal of a suburban realm, this middle landscape was enabled by the automobile. By the second half of the twentieth century, automobile and road engineering interests had been suc-<lb/>
cessful in enlarging the scale of the city as a physical entity, while retrofitting old urban streets as arteries for cars and trucks&#x2014;a detri-<lb/>
ment to their former function as sociable public space&#x2014;causing land use patterns to be rearranged in ways that left most people almost completely dependent on motor vehicular transportation. The automobile made it possible for the city to spread beyond all previously urbanized land as new areas became accessible and inter-<lb/>
connected by arterial roads and the entire metropolitan mass looped by a circumferential highway. The much shorter journey to work that was accomplished on foot when the city was still a series of multiple-use districts, with commerce and residence side by side, had become extended for middle-class breadwinners in the early twentieth century with the development of streetcar suburbs. Now, new residential neighborhoods spread into the spaces between the radial rail lines as well as into the rural fringe, and old center-city neighborhoods in the United States were abandoned to the poor-<lb/>
est members of society. The progressive outward migration related to increasing levels in income, with the wealthiest citizens of the city living farthest from the urban core, is a primarily American phenomenon. In continental European cities, by contrast, prestige still adheres to the urban center.</p>
<p>The great highway building period that ensued in the United States following the Highway Act of <date when="1956">1956</date> was rationalized as a boon to motorist safety, business accessibility, and civilian security, for with the escalation of the Cold War, government transporta-<lb/>
tion officials made a priority of planning for troop movement and urban evacuation in the event of a nuclear attack. The biggest finan-<lb/>
cial beneficiaries were the developers who bought land and con-<lb/>
structed mass-market housing on tracts of real estate close to the new highways and those who financed, built, and rented to com-<lb/>
<pb n="458"/>
<pb n="458" type="orig"/>
mercial tenants space in a new kind of retail facility, the suburban shopping center. The success of this new type of retail conglom-<lb/>
eration, which led to the development of the shopping mall, was highly instrumental in the disaggregation of the city and the replace-<lb/>
ment of its old single-core form with the multinucleated regional model with which Americans are familiar today.</p>

<figDesc><hi rend="bold">14.1. <name type="place">Las Vegas</name></hi></figDesc>
</figure>
<p>In the consumer society, the objects of dream and desire and the objects of industrial manufacture are often the same. Shopping malls are consumerist landscapes by definition, and their develop-<lb/>
ers have been extremely inventive in creating recreational environ-<lb/>
ments for commerce. These challenge older forms of urban design while providing a highly popular type of quasi-public space. In com-<lb/>
bining recreation with commerce, shopping malls have come increasingly to resemble another landscape form, the theme park.</p>
<p>Disneyland and its successors demonstrate the degree to which theater&#x2014;a venerable component of garden design&#x2014;has been subsumed by the fast-growing entertainment industry and how this industry, in turn, has affected landscape design. The pop-<lb/>
ularity of the theme park as a participatory experience in which consumers and "cast members" intermingle in a theatrical setting carefully contrived by "imagineers"&#x2014;the designers who create landscapes of association based on fairy tales, children's stories, animated cartoons, foreign countries, and heritage ideals&#x2014;is a twentieth-century cultural phenomenon to ponder. Phenomenal is the degree to which the themes and characters of theme parks have influenced the general public's attitude toward animals, plants, exotic lands, famous sights, and the women and men of history. In this we see the power of the media, another outgrowth of con-<lb/>
sumer capitalism, for televised images and advertising implant these visions in the minds of old and young, no matter how they trivial-<lb/>
ize the art and realities that inspired them in the first place. These pervasive images of consumer culture have become as significant perhaps to the present generation as the gods and heroes in the Homeric epics and the tales of Ovid were in other centuries.</p>
<p>Yet, verisimilitude compels our admiration. The wizardry of the stage-set environments in theme parks, with their elaborate invisible technological infrastructures, has been augmented with imagery derived from the camera, a machine that has been exert-<lb/>
ing a profound influence upon the experience of place for a cen-<lb/>
tury and a half. That some people prefer theme-park replications to the original models is due in no small part to the large role that various forms of photography have come to have in our lives. We trust the camera as a recorder of "reality," and we easily transfer emotional responses from the actual world around us to the sub-<lb/>
jects and scenes in photographs.</p>
<p>Photography's role with regard to landscape has several dimensions. A nineteenth-century invention, the stereopticon cam-<lb/>
era, created three-dimensional "magic lantern" views of famous landscapes for armchair tourists. Then, in the hands of actual tourists, cameras became a means of recording visited landscapes. But today, photography is more than another method for imaging reality. In consumerist democracies of the West, the mass appeal of familiar stories and images drawn from popular movies actively propels design. The relationship between theme parks and the movie industry is familial; the art of the Hollywood studio and the movie-set construction technology of the Hollywood back lot fostered Disneyland and its successors. Because of its popularity and commercial success, the thematic landscape is a growing phe-<lb/>
nomenon, especially in the United States.<ref target="#CH14-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>Now, blurring the dis-<lb/>
tinction between the real and the virtual, entire cities and towns are being "themed." Las Vegas, which markets itself as a family vacation resort as well as the casino capital of the world, is the most conspicuous representative of this trend, having turned its famous strip into a fantastic m&#x00E9;lange of other times and other places, both fictional and real&#x2014;Monte Carlo, Treasure Island, ancient <name type="place">Egypt</name>, imperial Rome, modern <name type="place">New York</name> City (fig. 14.1). Some may find it appropriate that the nation that invented Hollywood should be reinvented by Hollywood in turn.</p>

<p>The full potential of the automobile to transform life in the United States and other industrial nations in ways that even the visitors to the Futurama exhibit at the <date when="1939">1939</date> <name type="place">New York</name> World's Fair would not have grasped only began to be realized with the passage by Congress of the <date when="1956">1956</date> Highway Act. This legislation contributed to the home-building explosion that accounts for sub-<lb/>
urbia, the wide ring of converging developer subdivi-<lb/>
sions surrounding major cities that succeeded the carefully planned garden suburbs of the <date when="1920">1920</date>s and the New Deal Greenbelt Towns of the <date when="1930">1930</date>s. The High-<lb/>
way Act authorized a federal Highway Trust Fund with revenues derived from taxes on fuel, tires, and new vehicles of all kinds, as well as a use tax on com-<lb/>
mercial trucks. The funds were to pay 90 percent of the cost of creating an interstate highway system, with the states paying the remaining 10 percent. The logic behind this extraordinary legislation was as simple as the consequences were far-reaching.</p>

<p>In the United States, the powers of the federal gov-<lb/>
ernment were extended during the Great Depression and following World War II in order to stimulate new housing construction and large-scale suburban devel-<lb/>
opment by means of two important loan insurance programs&#x2014;that of the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and the Veterans Administration (VA). These proved a boon to developers and homeowners alike. The bias in <name type="place">America</name> toward home ownership is still enshrined in the income tax laws by the allowable deduction from gross income of mortgage interest and real estate taxes. Because banks as lenders must assess the financial reliability of mortgage loan appli-<lb/>
cants, credit qualification is a frequent obstacle to home ownership. The New Dealers who created the Federal Housing Authority in <date when="1934">1934</date> during the Great Depression did so in order to encourage investment of private capital in the construction industry and thereby stimulate employment within the building trades. Ten years later, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, or GI Bill as it is popularly known, created the Veterans Administration to ease the transition of mil-<lb/>
itary men to civilian society. Because both of these programs made possible minimum down payments of 10 percent or less on the purchase price, young Americans starting their families in the years imme-<lb/>
diately following World War II flocked to inspect the model homes and thereupon to sign up for purchase in the first tract housing suburbs. They sprang up in metropolitan fringes across the country, from Levit-<lb/>
town on Long Island, to Lakewood in <name type="place">California</name> (fig. 14.2).<ref target="#CH14-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref>Increased affluence combined with widespread status seeking, television's portrayal of suburban mid-<lb/>
dle-class life, and the absence of household servants all stimulated the desire for mechanical conveniences, which had been pent up during the war. This occa-<lb/>
sioned the birth of the consumer society, and devel-<lb/>
opers were quick to see that furnishing their small, cheaply constructed houses with new household appliances was an important sales asset.</p>

<p>Writing about Lakewood, which was built near the Douglas Aircraft Company and where he still lives in the house his parents bought in <date when="1946">1946</date>, <name type="pname">D. J. Waldie</name> describes the sales process:
<q>The salesmen did not encourage buyers to linger. Husbands and wives selected a floor plan, signed a sales contract, looked at a map of the tract, and accepted the house they were assigned. The salesman got a thirty-five-dollar commission on each sale. In the office, among displays showing construction photographs and sales brochures, the houses may have retreated slightly. If the buyers hesitated, astonished at what they were about to do, the salesman looked past them to the line of other husbands and wives watching their children in the bright light.<ref target="#CH14-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>The economies of scale, factory methods of construction, relaxation of local building-code stan-<lb/>
dards, small and uniform lot sizes, and simplification of house designs to a few variants upon a basic pat-<lb/>
tern made possible cheap offering prices for new homes. For developers who agreed to adhere to the FHA standards, the federal programs acted as a tremendous incentive, since the federal mortgage
<pb n="460"/>
<pb n="460" type="orig"/>
guarantees encouraged banks to finance their entire costs: acquiring land, installing streets and utilities, and constructing houses. The programs even rec-<lb/>
ommended prototypical subdivision layouts (fig. 14.3). These things accounted for the cookie-cutter look that critics soon began to castigate. The equally harsh judgment that from the air the typical plan of curving streets with their cul-de-sac offshoots resem-<lb/>
bled a can of worms did not acknowledge that it was derived from highly respected earlier new town plan-<lb/>
ning models. One was Clarence Perry's <date when="1929">1929</date> hierar-<lb/>
chical community-based network of winding local streets, feeder roads, and connecting arterials (see Chapter Twelve). The curvilinear streets were also much simplified versions of nineteenth-century Pic-<lb/>
turesque principles, which put a premium upon sur-<lb/>
prise by eliminating corridor views and withholding from sight what was around the bend. At eye level, this strategy may have mitigated the bland sameness of the new houses built on uniform lots, 50 to 60 feet wide and 100 to 120 feet deep with uniform setbacks along blocks 600 to <date when="1300">1300</date> feet long by 200 to 300 feet wide. A less artificial picturesqueness accrued as trees matured and homeowners set about enclosing garages, building additions to their houses, planting gardens, and otherwise improving their individual piece of the American Dream.</p>

<p>Although developers, in naming their subdivi-<lb/>
sions, usually included singly or in combination the words <hi rend="italic">park, wood, valley, hills, lake,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">meadow,</hi> thereby promoting the concept that the entire community was a park, they did not follow the builders of Rad-<lb/>
burn in making a green spine the armature of their plan. Such hills and valleys as existed were on the still-<lb/>
rural fringe of the new subdivision or in scraps of nat-<lb/>
ural terrain within it that had been left vacant because they were topographically unsuited for house lots. These were the small paradises in which children played. Waldie remembers the 10-foot-deep, open drainage ditches between Lakewood's neigh-<lb/>
borhoods as filled with cattails and tadpoles in the spring. He writes, "The ditches attracted boys in packs of four or five, as did any empty lot where there was enough room to dig."<ref target="#CH14-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Alfred Levitt, who was trained as an architect, laid out the lots of the Long Island Levittown with their near-identical Cape Cod Colonial houses around a series of "Village Greens," which contained neighborhood shops, a playground, and a swimming pool. But a more plentiful green space was to be found in the continuous lawn strip composed of contiguous front yards, the individual public face each neighbor-<lb/>
ing family presents. Unfenced, these essential emblems for American homeowners of proprietorship, domes-<lb/>
ticity, and lingering rural values form a greensward that serves as a collectively maintained park. "When I walk to work," writes Waldie, "I walk through a vista that is almost one continuous garden and lawn, bro-<lb/>
ken every fifty feet by a concrete driveway."<ref target="#CH14-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref>But the premium put on private space over this community space is evident in the fact that many subdivisions do not have sidewalks. The front porch no longer exists and has been replaced by a patio or deck in back. The phrase "right in your own backyard" denotes proxim-<lb/>
ity, convenience, and the premium put on space ded-<lb/>
icated to private family interests. Here, in addition to the swing sets and wading pools that equip innumer-<lb/>
able family-scale playgrounds are to be found barbe-<lb/>
cue grills and various pieces of lawn furniture as well as accoutrements for pets.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Joseph Eichler</name> (<date when="1900">1900</date>&#x2013;<date when="1974">1974</date>), a developer from <name type="place">New York</name> who took up residence in the Bay Area in <date when="1940">1940</date>, brought architectural attention to the design of the <name type="place">California</name> version of the suburban dream house. After having rented for three years a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in Hillsborough, <name type="place">California</name>, Eichler decided to bring some of Wright's modernist principles to bear on tract house design. He hired Robert Anshen, a young architect, to work for him. The result, as the architectural historian Gwendolyn Wright explains, was that "American residential design crossbred a modernist pedigree with everyday ver-<lb/>
nacular ‘livability.'"<ref target="#CH14-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref>The two-car garage is the most prominent feature of the front of an Eichler house,
<pb n="461"/>
<pb n="461" type="orig"/>
and the small landscaped entry courtyard has floor-<lb/>
to-ceiling, sliding glass doors, which increase its sense of airy openness (fig. 14.4). The open floor plan gave importance to the kitchen with its modern appliances, allowing eye contact between this area and the mul-<lb/>
tipurpose family room, a postwar innovation where children could play indoors, teenagers could listen to phonograph records, and everyone could watch tel-<lb/>
evision. Becoming more than shelter, in the postwar years the American home had simultaneously shrunk in interior size and been transformed, climate per-<lb/>
mitting, into the locus of outdoor living.</p>
<p>Connecting the street with the carport or garage&#x2014;no longer an ancillary structure in the back-<lb/>
yard but now firmly attached to the house&#x2014;the driveway assumed prominence as a recreational space, being an ideal surface for learning to ride a bicycle or toss a basketball. Cynthia Girling and Kenneth Help-<lb/>
hand call this the "most representative of American open spaces" because, "[t]he driveway sits at that junc-<lb/>
ture between . . . the traditional stability of home, neighborhood, and community, and the modern mobility of the automobile, speed, and travel."<ref target="#CH14-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref>Not surprisingly, in Herbert Gans's pioneering study of Levittown, for adolescents, "the commonest gripe is the shortage of ready transportation, which makes not only facilities but, more important, other teenagers inaccessible."<ref target="#CH14-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref>This observation merely underlines the fact that the postwar suburb, being the creature of the automobile and the highway, rein-<lb/>
forces the primacy of the automobile as the domi-<lb/>
nant mode of transportation and maroons its residents if they cannot drive. Because its existence made possible the development of certain new land-<lb/>
scape types, it is the indispensable means of access to these places, as is also obvious in an examination of two closely related phenomena: the shopping mall and the theme park.</p>

<p>The image of the city as a coherent mass with a uni-<lb/>
tary center&#x2014;a village green, main plaza, or court-<lb/>
house square&#x2014;has been superseded by that of the multinodal metropolis. This urban reconfiguration has been spearheaded by retailing. Indeed, the devel-<lb/>
opment of the highway-related shopping <hi rend="italic">center</hi> was the first step in a process of urban disaggregation and reformation according to a texture that, though more loosely woven, nevertheless has knots of commercial density, retail and entertainment nuclei that serve many of the functions formerly accommodated in the city centers Americans have long referred to as "downtown." Developers with the ability to seize the opportunity presented by the new suburban market &#x2014;its <hi rend="italic">auto-mobility</hi> and continually expanding desire for consumer goods of all kinds and in all price ranges, as well as the growing distance to downtown and the heightened parking congestion there&#x2014;were the pri-<lb/>
mary shapers of this new urban landscape.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">From Shopping Center to Shopping Male</hi></head>
<p>The Levitts soon realized that the convenience stores in their Village Greens on Long Island were losing money to a new regional shopping center on the high-<lb/>
way, and when they developed the next Levittown in <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, they built a related regional shopping cen-<lb/>
ter to draw business from beyond their property's own boundaries. The developers of the postwar shopping centers did not invent this form of retailing clus-<lb/>
tering but relied on a growing body of experience dating from the <date when="1920">1920</date>s.<ref target="#CH14-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref>The pioneer of the first large-<lb/>
scale suburban shopping center, a 250-store shopping village as this type of new development became known, was <name type="pname">J. C. Nichols</name>, who developed the Coun-<lb/>
try Club Plaza in <name type="place">Kansas</name> City, Missouri, beginning in <date when="1922">1922</date> (fig. 14.5). Previously, commercial real estate developers assessed the potential markets implied by areas of suburban population, acquired land for shop-<lb/>
ping strips, and sold individual properties to busi-<lb/>
nesses. These establishments competed for the driver's attention with boldly scaled frontage signs. Nichols realized that an increasing number of women resid-<lb/>
ing in the affluent Country Club district of <name type="place">Kansas</name> City now drove cars. To attract their business, he cre-<lb/>
ated within several contiguous conventional street blocks designed for local traffic an architecturally homogeneous, domestically accented environment with ample parking. Shoppers left their cars in free, landscaped, off-street lots and at the curbside adjacent
<pb n="462"/>
<pb n="462" type="orig"/>
to stores whose tenants were selected on the basis of careful market analysis. Because it was an integrated building complex under a single management, the Country Club Plaza could be built with a unified appearance, and its agreeable neoSpanish Colonial architecture and carefully controlled signs broadcast the message that shopping was enjoyable, even a pleasant recreational pastime.</p>

<p>Other successful early shopping centers in-<lb/>
cluded Shaker Square, serving the exclusive Shaker Heights suburb of <name type="place">Cleveland</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>. Though catering to the automobile, it was linked by public transit with the major downtown shopping and business complex at Terminal Tower. In contrast to the Tower's sky-<lb/>
scraper modernity, the square's neo-Georgian archi-<lb/>
tecture declared the symbiosis between shopping village and upscale residential suburb and defined the center's image as a gateway to genteel domesticity.</p>
<p>Hugh Prather, the developer of Highland Park Village, serving the 1,400-acre, prosperous Highland Park suburb of Dallas, based his plan on the county courthouse square prevalent in <name type="place">Texas</name>, substituting for the traditional edifice of justice a central cluster of shops surrounded by plenty of convenient parking. In focusing inward, Highland Park Village became the first shopping center to turn its back to the street. Seeking architectural distinction, Prather took his designers to <name type="place">California</name> and Spain to gain inspiration for "one of the more sophisticated adaptations of the Spanish Colonial Revival mode for commercial pur-<lb/>
poses."<ref target="#CH14-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref>The ideal of architectural theming as a means of crafting a highly distinctive, if borrowed, sense of place was thus well established in this early shopping center. Although the merchandising goals of Prather's selectively chosen commer-<lb/>
cial tenants were ambitious, the specialty items they offered did not compete seriously with the array of goods in downtown stores.</p>
<p>Suburban Square in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, on <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>'s Main Line began to alter the picture. Developed adjacent to Ardmore's existing commercial area and situated centrally rather than in relation to a specific residential enclave, Suburban Square did not seek a suburban image. Instead of fostering iden-<lb/>
tity in architecturally revivalist, domestically oriented, low-rise stores, it proclaimed its status as an impor-<lb/>
tant business center by attracting the first major department store branch to anchor a shopping cen-<lb/>
ter. The syndicate of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> businessmen who planned and developed Suburban Square reserved land from the start for ample off-street parking. They also encouraged the nascent trend of medical and other professionals opening offices close to their patients and clients by including in the Times Build-<lb/>
ing, home of the <hi rend="italic">Main Line Times,</hi> seven stories of space accommodating fifty offices.</p>
<p>Stymied from widespread multiplication by the Great Depression and World War II, these suburban shopping centers remained the prominent predeces-<lb/>
sors of the ones that began to proliferate along with the new subdivisions after the war. With less need to focus upon attracting the upper-middle-class patron by then, developers could adopt a more pragmatic and less costly architectural approach. With prof-<lb/>
itability assured as the suburban exodus mounted, they no longer felt they had to create what Richard Longstreth calls "distinct signifiers of place."<ref target="#CH14-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>Gone was the passing parade of downtown pedestrians. Window dressing, which older department stores had carried to an art form, was no longer considered important because parking lots had replaced urban sidewalks. By the <date when="1950">1950</date>s, when the regional shopping mall&#x2014;an important centrifugal force in the growth of what is now termed "spread city"&#x2014;came into being, some of the earlier shopping villages declined. Today, however, in an atmosphere of revaluation of the city and its older suburbs, several have been revi-<lb/>
talized.<ref target="#CH14-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Planned to serve regional markets rather than specific suburbs, the shopping mall is frequently located at a highway interchange near the metropol-<lb/>
itan periphery. Products, like much of suburbia, of the federal highway building program and federal tax laws that assisted developers in depreciating their investments, the malls were often the advance guard of suburbanization. The suburban house, socially focused on the private realm of indoors and backyard, with automobile functions&#x2014;garage and driveway&#x2014; prominently assigned to the front where no sidewalks or other signs of accommodation to public life exist, is a domestic form of the shopping mall. The mall's distinguishing feature is a vast perimeter parking area, or several parking areas, ringed by an exterior circu-<lb/>
<pb n="463"/>
<pb n="463" type="orig"/>
lation road. Like the the house's little-used front yard, this exterior zone is often landscaped with planting islands of trees and other greenery.</p>

</figure>
<p>The focus of the mall is its central, auto-free zone of stores. Here, the suburban shopper becomes separated from the necessary conveyance for arrival, a pedestrian like the urban shopper of former times. Pioneered by architect-planner <name type="pname">Victor Gruen</name> (<date when="1903">1903</date>&#x2013;<date when="1980">1980</date>) in the early <date when="1950">1950</date>s, mall layout soon became formulaic: a "dumbbell" plan consisting of two <hi rend="italic">magnet stores,</hi> one&#x2014;usually a high-end-retail department store branch&#x2014;placed so as to be seen from the highway at one end&#x2014;and the other&#x2014;often a national franchise operation selling useful products for the home and garden as well as less expensive items&#x2014;at the opposite end. In between, on either side of a pedestrian open space meant to evoke the historic <name type="place">New England</name> village green, were small shops selling gifts, books, recordings, cosmetics, and other items that visitors to the magnet stores might pur-<lb/>
chase on an impulse as they walked by.</p>
<p>During the <date when="1960">1960</date>s, the suburban mall became an enclosed pedestrian space. It also became much more commercial and urban in appearance. Its center no longer harked back to the <name type="place">New England</name> township but instead to the high, glass-vaulted shopping arcades, or <hi rend="italic">gallerias,</hi> in <name type="place">London</name>, Milan, <name type="place">Paris</name>, and other Euro-<lb/>
pean cities.<ref target="#CH14-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref>In <date when="1956">1956</date>, at Southdale, near Minneapo-<lb/>
lis, Gruen perfected as a development form what mall trade organizations call EMACs&#x2014;Enclosed Malls Air-<lb/>
Conditioned. In the enclosed mall's pseudo-urban environment, shoppers presumably needed visual relief from the density of detail where such an abun-<lb/>
dance of merchandise was on display. Gruen there-<lb/>
fore created a central atrium&#x2014;at Southdale called the Garden Court of Perpetual Spring&#x2014;a ground-to-roof navelike space filled with light, greenery, flowers, and fountains. Well maintained, such naturalistic oases enhanced the image of the mall as an uplifting place to visit, while also serving the ancillary function of channeling shoppers into side aisles next to the chapel-<lb/>
like shops.</p>
<p>The mall in this new enclosed form became increasingly a place for recreation. Like its European predecessor, the EMAC has three or four levels of shopping ranged around a skylit central court (fig. 14.6). Park benches invite its use as a quasi-public space, and many mall visitors come not necessarily to shop but because they are seeking an attractive, comfortable, safe, yet lively and sociable place where they can pass time. Early-bird mall walkers find secu-<lb/>
rity and pleasure in congregating in the morning to jog for fitness along the interior "streets" of many enclosed malls.</p>
<p>Often the mall in its asphalt sea of parking appears as a blight upon the local scenery. But some mall operators have tried to stitch their centers together with the adjacent urban fabric. The <name type="place">Hous-<lb/>
ton</name> Galleria, for instance, was instrumental in creat-<lb/>
ing a business improvement district in the Post Oak district, and this public-private corporation has spon-<lb/>
sored new street furniture and public art along the mall's periphery in an effort to acknowledge the Gal-<lb/>
leria's status as a second downtown, the city's most visited tourist attraction, and the location of its great-<lb/>
est concentration of retail and hotel space and high-<lb/>
<pb n="464"/>
<pb n="464" type="orig"/>
rise apartment units as well as the site of several office buildings, including the Transco Tower skyscraper (fig. 14.7).</p>

</figure>
<p>Recreation and entertainment are becoming principal commodities for mall retailers and develop-<lb/>
ers. A symbiotic profitability has been discovered between games, rides, and other theme-park activi-<lb/>
ties and old-fashioned shopping. Retailers call this "adjacent attraction." Like the planners of Rockefeller Center in <name type="place">New York</name> City, the creators of <name type="place">Houston</name>'s Galleria placed an ice-skating rink at its center. The 5.3-million-square-foot (1.58-million-square-meter) West Edmondton Mall in Alberta, <name type="place">Canada</name>&#x2014;the world's largest when it was built between <date when="1981">1981</date> and <date when="1985">1985</date>&#x2014;contains 11 department stores, more than 800 small retail shops, 110 restaurants, 13 nightclubs, a 360-room hotel with theme-park decor, 20 movie the-<lb/>
aters, a 500,000-square-foot (46,450-square-meter) water park, and other similar-size amusement areas. Scattered throughout this immense bulky tourist des-<lb/>
tination are many recreational experiences, including a roller coaster, a golf course, and a replica of Christo-<lb/>
pher Columbus's <hi rend="italic">Santa Maria.</hi></p>
<p>West Edmonton Mall's kaleidoscopic juxtapo-<lb/>
sition of highly dissimilar images exemplifies the extent to which techniques of cinematic montage in the service of consumer psychology now govern design. The same principles account for the current renaissance of the downtown areas in many major American cities where old-fashioned department stores are being replaced by urban malls. The artful blending of stagecraft and retailing also explains the successes of James Rouse, the mall developer who transformed such historic districts as <name type="place">Boston</name>'s Quincy Market, <name type="place">New York</name>'s South Street Seaport, and <name type="place">Balti-<lb/>
more</name>'s Harborplace into "festival markets" for recre-<lb/>
ational shoppers and tourists. Old town centers from Santa Fe, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, to Prague and <name type="place">Budapest</name> in Eastern Europe have been similarly reborn as com-<lb/>
modified representations of their former states. Cul-<lb/>
tural institutions, in turn, are becoming more mall-like in the manner in which they present art and science as well as in the way they create museum shops for the display and sale of commercial products associated with their collections and exhibits. To understand the underlying relationships among theme parks, shopping centers, cultural institutions, and historic districts and the trend toward increasing similarity in their market-driven design and management is to understand how the commodification of leisure has become a driving force in the economy and culture of Western societies and, as a conse-<lb/>
quence, the extent to which much contemporary landscape design has become a combination of enter-<lb/>
tainment-based narrative and commerce.<ref target="#CH14-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>The motion picture industry proved that the visual consumption of stories was a marketable commod-<lb/>
ity. By making them experiential, too, <name type="pname">Walter Elias</name> ("Walt") Disney (<date when="1901">1901</date>&#x2013;<date when="1966">1966</date>) pioneered the art of theming, which now pervades much of the built envi-<lb/>
ronment and the approach of many professional designers.</p>
<p>The relationship between the theater and the garden has always been strong. The garden as a place of fantasy and spectacle is an old notion. Le Nôtre planned seventeenth-century French gardens as sequences of theatrical spaces, with Moli&#x00E8;re staging actual plays at Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles. Eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century British aristocrats designed the grounds of their country estates as places of associa-<lb/>
tion where scenery and monuments stimulated reflection and reverie in which narrative played a role. But Disney invented the concept of the garden-as-enter-<lb/>
tainment, a stage set in which the visitor could par-<lb/>
ticipate in the action of an already scripted plot.</p>
<p>Disneyland and its successors epitomize the val-<lb/>
ues of twentieth-century media-driven consumer cul-<lb/>
ture and the growing influence of large corporations in American life. They also stand within the tradition of visionary idealism that includes the attempts by nineteenth-century park builders and twentieth-cen-<lb/>
tury planners of new towns to improve the industrial city or provide an alternative model to overcome its
<pb n="465"/>
<pb n="465" type="orig"/>
perceived ills. Disney wished to offer a highly positive and didactic experience that would influence human behavior and engender human happiness. His inno-<lb/>
vative genius lay in realizing that a fantasy-infused simulated landscape could carry this mission and be successfully mass-marketed in alliance with the emerging medium of television.</p>
<p>Disney understood well the value of market analysis, so in <date when="1953">1953</date>, he hired the Stanford Research Institute to study siting options for a family enter-<lb/>
tainment park that, like the animated films that he produced, would be "a world of people past and pres-<lb/>
ent seen through the eyes of my imagination, a place of warmth and nostalgia, of illusion and color and delight."<ref target="#CH14-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref>With the Santa Ana Expressway being planned to connect Los Angles and Burbank with Orange County, his site-selection research team sug-<lb/>
gested Anaheim, <name type="place">California</name>. There Disney purchased 160 acres of orange groves. Although he knew pro-<lb/>
fessional architects in <name type="place">Los Angeles</name>, he was soon con-<lb/>
vinced that the vision he had&#x2014;an amalgamation of storybook settings, the locales in the animated movies he produced, and his boyhood hometown of Marce-<lb/>
line, Missouri&#x2014;could only be carried out by people with experience in set design and cinematic scripting techniques. This meant the employees in the Burbank studios of the Walt Disney Company: <name type="pname">Herbert Dick-<lb/>
ens Ryman</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1988">1988</date>), the Disney artist and ani-<lb/>
mator who drew the perspective sketches that became the basis upon which the project received the $17 million needed to finance it.</p>
<p>Although Disneyland would have exhilarating rides, it rigorously eschewed association with Coney Island and other beachside amusement parks. The world's fairs of the previous hundred years were instead its close cousins, the expositions where peo-<lb/>
ple gathered in large numbers in an atmosphere of pristine cleanliness to view exhibitions that introduced them to new industrial technologies, new products to improve the conditions of contemporary life, and the folkways and crafts of other cultures. Disney's visionary agenda stressed the rosy themes of applied science without negative environmental conse-<lb/>
quences, history without shame, and human diver-<lb/>
sity without conflict.</p>
<p>Disney wanted to distract his park's visitors from the problems of the everyday world by giving them a good time and by carrying them backward to his own golden-age vision of the American small town of around <date when="1900">1900</date>, when he was a boy. He also wanted to carry them forward imaginatively to the techno-<lb/>
logically improved future. His park would therefore be both a period piece and an optimistic scenario of the progressive perfection enabled by modern engi-<lb/>
neering. Disney <hi rend="italic">imagineers</hi>&#x2014;the title he coined for the members of his creative design team&#x2014;would recap-<lb/>
ture for the public in Disneyland his delight in model trains and scale models of stage sets nostalgically evoking the vigor and wholesomeness of America's fron-<lb/>
tier-, rural-, and early-industrial-era past. Today, part of a global corporation, Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that develops the architectural programs and plans the company's theme parks, has a studio team of 1,200 planners, designers, architects, land-<lb/>
scape architects, engineers, computer scientists, and construction managers.</p>
<p>Disney, like the developers of shopping malls, understood the value of a manageable, human-scale, auto-free environment that was friendly to pedestri-<lb/>
ans. His careful segregation of cars and people and the use of tramways and other technologically advanced modes of mass transportation distinguished his approach to planning. The Santa Ana Freeway would carry visitors to Disneyland but not into the area beyond the berm, the tree-planted, miniature-railway-<lb/>
encircled cordon sanitaire that sequestered the park from the parking lot. This berm defining the park's outer periphery also served as a metaphor that was often evoked to distinguish between the "real" world inside&#x2014;Disney insisted, "Imagination is the model from which reality is created"<ref target="#CH14-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;and the chaotic, frus-<lb/>
trating world outside where social and personal prob-<lb/>
lems could not be banished by imagineering.</p>
<p>Superficially, the plan that originated in Disney's imagination and on Ryman's drawing board was not very different from that of the <name type="place">New York</name> World's Fair of <date when="1939">1939</date> (fig. 14.8; see figs. 12.35, 12.36). Using a con-<lb/>
ventional landscape formula combining Beaux-Arts and Picturesque planning principles, Ryman created a strong main axis, a promenade leading to a central hub beyond which rose a focal structure, or "wee-<lb/>
nie"&#x2014;slang for "wiener" or hot dog&#x2014;the spicy if inelegant term coined by Disney to denote the park's visual magnet. From the hub radiated various zones that became progressively more naturalistic in style. Near the berm, some contained irregularly config-<lb/>
ured lakes. Animators by training, with some back-<lb/>
ground in art and architecture, the imagineers working under Ryman conceived the park as they would a movie, as a series of <hi rend="italic">cinematic</hi> shots. Led by Disney, they were obsessive about exact replication of detail but cavalier with scale, knowing that optical effects were all-important. As set designers they were familiar with forced perspective&#x2014;the illusion of height gained by a progressive foreshortening of the vertical dimensions of a facade as it rises from ground level, so that the scale of the second floor is five-<lb/>
eighths that of the first, and so on&#x2014;a technique they exploited ingeniously at Disneyland.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they were producing the movie
<pb n="466"/>
<pb n="466" type="orig"/>
<hi rend="italic">Sleeping Beauty</hi> at the time but also because it seemed to strike just the right note of magic, Disney and his designers chose for their "weenie" Sleeping Beauty's Castle. Forced perspective gives it the illusion of ris-<lb/>
ing in the air, a soaring symbol of the fairy-tale qual-<lb/>
ity they wanted to pervade the park. Forced perspective was also an important design tool in the creation of Main Street, an evocation of Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri,<ref target="#CH14-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref>with Victorian period architectural detailing derived from Fort Collins, Colorado, because Harper Goff, one of Dis-<lb/>
ney's original imagineers had grown up there. This same effect was later repeated at Walt Disney World, near Orlando, <name type="place">Florida</name> (fig. 14.9). The Western flavor of Main Street is intentional; big city urbanism and the tawdry seediness of Coney Island&#x2014;Disney had a strong antipathy for both&#x2014;were associated with the East. "Scene One," as the designers called Main Street, is a m&#x00E9;lange of comforting impressions, which are reinforced by Disney's selectively recruited, highly trained employees, referred to as Cast Members. These personnel are encouraged to perfect a cheer-<lb/>
ful civility modeled on the perceived friendliness of Western small-town folk in bygone days.</p>

<p>Encouraged by Morgan "Bill" Evans, a nurs-<lb/>
eryman's son and landscape architect whom he hired to work for the company, Disney realized the capa-<lb/>
bility of the <name type="place">California</name> climate to support a widely diverse horticulture&#x2014;tropical, subtropical, and tem-<lb/>
perate-climate plants. He also saw how this broad array of plant material might creatively serve as the-<lb/>
matic background and how a specimen tree might even assume a starring role in one of his three-dimen-<lb/>
sional stories where guests and Cast Members min-<lb/>
gle in a setting of enhanced nature. Working in collaboration with studio artists, the staff of landscape architects at the Imagineering headquarters in Glen-<lb/>
dale, <name type="place">California</name>, pay close attention to color (fig. 14.10). In Fantasyland a palette of clear pinks, mauves, and lavender is echoed in the choice of floral and leaf tone. In Adventureland legumes and other plants keyed to a less dreamy, more action-oriented emo-<lb/>
tional pitch add splashes of vibrant red, flaming orange, and bright yellow to the scene. Disney horti-<lb/>
culturists provide plantings with the same high level of maintenance as would a botanical garden because the sight of healthy vegetation serves the company's upbeat happy-ending storytelling mission. This meticulousness is part of a general operational strat-<lb/>
egy. Instantaneous repair and cleanliness were from the beginning hallmarks of the Disney management style, and the upkeep of its simulated historic places
<pb n="467"/>
<pb n="467" type="orig"/>
goes far beyond anything the real ones ever enjoyed.</p>
<p>Adept at editing film sequences so that nothing is disjointed and everything flows seamlessly, Disney's imagineers carefully orchestrated the transitions between the park's zones or "lands"&#x2014;Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. Everything, even the numerous litter receptacles, is styled in each "land's" particular flavor of place and period. Modernistic streamlining prevails in Tomor-<lb/>
rowland; Cambodian, Polynesian, and African motifs in Adventureland; nineteenth-century Western ver-<lb/>
nacular in Frontierland; and the reigning idioms of fairy tales&#x2014;Bavarian Picturesque and Old English&#x2014; in Fantasyland. Yet so skillfully did the designers medi-<lb/>
ate among these styles that some interfacing buildings, such as the Plaza Pavilion restaurant, dis-<lb/>
play on their opposing facades entirely different archi-<lb/>
tectural detailing. Throughout the park, costumed personnel interact with <hi rend="italic">guests</hi>&#x2014;the term the Disney organization prefers to <hi rend="italic">visitor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">customer</hi>&#x2014;enter-<lb/>
taining those in line and further blurring the distinc-<lb/>
tion between reality and fantasy. Disney's planners so perfected the art of crowd management that waiting in line became a form of entertainment in the guest-<lb/>
holding areas, where vendors also congregate and where souvenir shops abound. Disneyland's atmos-<lb/>
phere of corporate friendliness also makes visitors more susceptible to the messages of industrial spon-<lb/>
sors, and several of its original exhibits were financed by major companies. The Disney Company's own image as a kindly corporate wizard is in turn imparted to the corporations allied with it.</p>
<p>Unlike the eighteenth-century English garden with its merely suggestive agenda of poetical associ-<lb/>
ation in the landscape, Disneyland and its successors are tightly scripted. To achieve this objective, the orig-<lb/>
inal orange groves and all other preexisting features of the Disney property were removed when con-<lb/>
struction began in <date when="1954">1954</date>. Instead of eliciting "the genius of <hi rend="italic">the place"</hi> as did the creators of <name type="place">England</name>'s great estate parks, Disney imagineers ingeniously replicate <hi rend="italic">other places.</hi> In order to add some valuable foreign currency to their bank of intellectual capital the company sends them to faraway locales where they absorb impressions and take notes and photo-<lb/>
graphs. But Disney horticulturists do not, for obvious climatic reasons, adhere completely to the vegetative palette of those other environments but instead blend species native to many different countries to gain their desired effects.</p>
<p>Disneyland represents a new kind of American landscape. Built on the premise that an expanding population of automobile-owning families would pay to experience a richly storied environment at once nostalgic and future-oriented, where reality and imag-<lb/>
ination, fact and fiction, nature and technology were seamlessly blended and enhanced through entertain-<lb/>
ment, it launched the concept of the park as a com-<lb/>
mercial venture, something quite different from the park as a public trust, free to all. In this it was, as we have already remarked, akin to world's fairs, which were also built with corporate participation as the-<lb/>
matic, commercial ventures that aimed to entertain and uplift a mass audience.</p>

<p>If the theme park is seen as a hybrid landscape derived from the world's fair, a nineteenth-century creation, and cinema and television, which have exerted a profound influence on all facets of culture since the second half of the twentieth century, it can also be viewed as influential in its own right. The treat-<lb/>
ment of history as narrative capable of stage-set expli-<lb/>
cation is a theme-park strategy that has been carried over into the preservation of historic towns and old urban centers. In <date when="1856">1856</date>, with prescient horror John Ruskin wrote in <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters, Volume IV</hi> of the transformation he foresaw at Lucerne, Switzerland:
<pb n="468"/>
<pb n="468" type="orig"/>
"Lucerne consisting of a row of symmetrical hotels around the foot of the lake, its old bridges destroyed, an iron one built over the Reuss, and an acacia prom-<lb/>
enade carried along the lake-shore, with a German band playing under a Chinese temple at the end of it, and the enlightened travelers, representatives of Euro-<lb/>
pean civilization, performing before the Alps, in each afternoon summer sunlight, in their modern manner, the Dance of Death."<ref target="#CH14-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref>One shudders to imagine what Ruskin might write about Lucerne today along with many other quaint old European towns whose natural picturesqueness has been self-consciously deployed in the interest of mass tourism, a strategy attended by advertising and marketing techniques he certainly never dreamed of.</p>

<p>In <date when="1921">1921</date>, in "The Second Coming," the Irish poet William Butler Yeats lamented, "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."<ref target="#CH14-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref>In a terrible century when old certain-<lb/>
ties about the existence of a God-ordained world order were challenged and Romantic intimations of Nature's inherent divinity waned, it is perhaps under-<lb/>
standable that the seat of moral philosophy as cultu-<lb/>
ral matrix would be superseded by mere storytelling, a theatrics of past and place in the interest of identity and present pleasure. Without denying that mass tourism and the theming of historic places has certain social and educational benefits, we should also rec-<lb/>
ognize that narrative place-making is part of a pro-<lb/>
foundly unsettling cultural pattern in which concepts of highly localized, particularized place are being replaced by a sense of universalized, instantaneously accessible, placeless "placeness." Thus, place is treated patronizingly as something easily replicable and fun-<lb/>
gible, and the unique qualities of particular places are curiously devalued even as they are being celebrated. This cultural bias away from place-making based upon ideological representation is symptomatic of the pres-<lb/>
ent Western world-view in which historical phenom-<lb/>
ena, especially those related to ethnicity and ethnic heritage, are signifiers of a multicultural perspective that has become a cultural value in its own right.</p>
<p>In pointing out the trend toward landscape "theming," we must not overlook the fact that preser-<lb/>
vationism also embraces a genuine reverence for important relics of the past that lies deeper than the exploitation of history as thematic entertainment, commercial asset, or political statement. Allied with the desire to preserve authentic landmarks is the awareness that the conservation of natural areas is vital both to planetary health and human happiness. In the face of the ease of mimesis in the new Infor-<lb/>
mation Age and the specter of increased wholesale destruction of "first nature" in the continuing Machine Age, we must now attempt to understand what landscape designers and artists have done in recent years as preservationists, conservationists, and creators of metaphorically meaningful Earthworks.</p>

tural ideas and ideals). We might provision-<lb/>
ally term "fourth nature" a concept that recognizes the machine not as an alien intruder in the garden ("third nature") but rather as a commonplace adjunct to all nature, an often integral and expressive part of its fabric and, with the advent of Internet technology, the means of creating a new spatial realm independent of the material, physical world.

<p>The rapidity of change in the designed landscape is an important by-product of modernity. The accelerating powers of the Late Machine Age and the new Information Age have gained tremendous force as the fast-paced and continually evolving alliance of science and technology has assumed a position of extraordinary cultural dominance in contemporary society. This has caused the meaning of space and time to simultaneously expand and contract. Even as we contemplate travel to the outer reaches of our universe, contempo-<lb/>
rary cosmology offers only the most contingent explanation of our place within its framework. Because of these things, everything appears to be mutable. Increasingly, place appears to be in flux.</p>
<p>Just as modern physics has unseated old cosmological veri-<lb/>
ties, proving that outer space is an indeterminate galactic sprawl, so too have the centrifugal forces that once constellated suburbs within the orbit of major urban centers been superseded by newer technologies that make even so-called Edge Cities edgeless, part of a patterning of amorphous human settlement never before seen. Like a mutating organism, this kind of sprawling urbanism is part of the unending process of landscape transformation.</p>
<p>Industrial technology has created within the span of a single century an entirely new landscape of electric power grids, conti-<lb/>
nent-spanning highways, and skyscraper cities that would seem unbelievable to a visitor from the not-too-distant past. The mod-<lb/>
ern regional city&#x2014;a loose-knit urban agglomerate containing air-<lb/>
ports, expressways, a vast network of streets and corresponding pattern of lights and neon signs, and air-conditioned high-rise commercial buildings set in a sea of suburban homes and shopping centers&#x2014;is still a recent phenomenon. The passenger elevator, water mains, and pipes for the delivery of hot and cold running water, the flush toilet&#x2014;all these developments that we now take for granted are minor when compared with the way technology has revolutionized agriculture and gathered up entire populations from the land and enfolded them into the city Urbanism has so pervaded the rural landscape that the metaphor of "the machine in the gar-<lb/>
den," as analyzed by Leo Marx from a literary perspective in his book of that title, can now be inverted; the quintessential <hi rend="italic">rus in urbe,</hi> Central Park, could be called "the garden in the machine" that is <name type="place">New York</name> City, the heart of the Atlantic seaboard megalopolis, which extends from <name type="place">Boston</name> to <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name></p>
<p>Even where suburbanization has not occurred, farming as an economic mainstay and means of individual family livelihood has all but disappeared as industrial technology has transformed food production and efficient transportation systems have enabled national and global shipments of perishable commodities. Rural land, much of it reverting to second growth, is valued more as scenery than as cropland or pasture. Local farming, where it still exists, has become either marginal or a specialized enterprise cater-<lb/>
ing to an upscale market. A rural residence no longer implies an agrarian occupation or outlook as increasingly for many people res-<lb/>
idential location is becoming a matter of personal choice.</p>
<p>Corporate franchises have assisted suburban developers in the colonization of regional space. Everywhere the forces of global capitalism are at work. Powered by mass marketing and advertis-<lb/>
ing, they are creating a universal culture, making national and regional identities less distinctive even as growing numbers of tourists travel to remote places in search of <hi rend="italic">local</hi> color.</p>
<p>Centripetal as well as centrifugal forces are at work. As cities in <name type="place">America</name> and elsewhere begin to reverse their recent decades of decline with renewed capital investment in their core areas and the residential return of retirement couples and young professionals, their attractiveness as places to live as well as their role as tourist destinations and entertainment centers is increasing. Thus we see at the beginning of the twenty-first century a transformation of the city not by governmental planning, such as was sought by
<pb n="471"/>

visionaries at the beginning of the previous century, but rather by free enterprise. No longer centers of manufacturing and trade, some cities are promoting themselves in terms of the service economy and a more vibrant lifestyle than can be found in the suburbs. Many are reconfiguring industrial waterfronts as promenades lined with restaurants, sports facilities, and outdoor festival spaces; retrofitting commercial real estate with mall-style stores and theaters; turning industrial buildings into loft apartments, shops, artists' studios and galleries; and reclaiming abandoned rail and canal rights-of-way as jogging and bike trails. Cultural centers, entertainment complexes, and arenas for spectator sports are high on almost every contempo-<lb/>
rary urban agenda. These things, together with electronic-game arcades, health clubs, tennis centers, and other fitness and recreational facilities, are making cities places that are increasingly dedicated to personal gratification.</p>
<p>In addition, with a sense of entitlement to recreational ben-<lb/>
efits implicit in the democratic values of Western industrial coun-<lb/>
tries and <name type="place">Japan</name>, leisure continues to give rise to new land uses and landscape designs, as evidenced by the construction of golf courses in many countries and climates, even desert ones, because of the phenomenal latter-day popularity of an obscure sport that origi-<lb/>
nated on the links lands of estuarial <name type="place">Scotland</name> in the fifteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. Thus, ironically in accommodating new forms of pleasure, the metropolis, which has so urbanized its surrounding rural landscape that its natural environs have all but disappeared, is itself becoming more parklike in character.</p>
<p>Photography's relationship to landscape, discussed in the pre-<lb/>
vious chapter, grows apace. As a genre, landscape photography stimulates an appreciation of the poetics of place and builds archives that register the appearance and uses of places through time. Today historical photographs of landscapes and cityscapes provide a valu-<lb/>
able record of their former appearance, assisting preservationists and educating the public. Aerial photography is an important tool for the cultural geographer's reading of the vernacular landscape. It has made commonplace the <hi rend="italic">synoptic</hi> vision that Patrick Geddes advocated from his Outlook Tower&#x2014;that is, seeing cities and their regional landscapes entire in a single panoramic bird's-eye view that reveals overall structure while eliminating from sight close-range detail and disorder. Further, photography is the indispensable means whereby artists of Earthworks or Conceptual pieces of a tempo-<lb/>
rary nature document and gain recognition of their work.</p>
<p>In addition, photography has altered the way in which we read the city. Film has made us comfortable with <hi rend="italic">montage,</hi> choosing relevant fragments from a plethora of visual stimuli and reassem-<lb/>
bling them into a coherent personal imagery and narrative that is both sensory and symbolic. Urbanites are all film editors to a degree; understanding the metropolis and feeling at home in its impersonal immensity would be difficult without this strategy of composite conceptualization. An important means of distraction from everyday life, film has become a contemporary form of <hi rend="italic">fl&#x00E2;nerie,</hi> the voyeuristic pursuit of the everyday dramas of the metropolis. Mental mapping of the city is, as urban design analyst Kevin Lynch taught, a means of parsing it through a process of per-<lb/>
sonal landmarking.<ref target="#CH15-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>Notable architecture and important public places&#x2014;as well as the locations of establishments that cater to our personal needs&#x2014;become geographies of the mind. As cities grow increasingly vast and diffuse, this imagistic form of perception is the only way in which we are able to make sense of our sur-<lb/>
roundings. Urban public space has, like films and photomontage, become for deconstructivist philosophers such as Jacques Derrida (b. <date when="1930">1930</date>) an impersonal vessel for multiple, simultaneous, and sequential personal meanings.</p>
<p>The incomprehensibility of the modern city and its suburbs is mitigated by networks of communication and transportation&#x2014; newspapers, radio and television broadcasting, bus and subway routes. We grasp the city in terms of these lines of movement and channels of information, media for a miscellany of messages as well as the means of navigating the metropolis. Photography in the form of advertising saturates these networks just as it domi-<lb/>
nates prominent public spaces where there is a large flow of traf-<lb/>
fic. We have become comfortable with our dichotomous existence, at home physically in front of the television set and at the same time mentally in Bangladesh where disaster has struck or at the scene of a crime in another part of our own city, courtesy of the news services' roving video crews.<ref target="#CH15-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref>We swim in a sea of visual stim-<lb/>
uli, and increasingly what we focus upon most intently is not our visible surroundings but the mental images evoked by representa-<lb/>
tions of another reality elsewhere.</p>
<p>With the commodification of urban life and culture, pho-<lb/>
tography has played a significant role in eroticizing the public envi-<lb/>
ronment. Libidinal stimuli proliferate as ads on bus shelters, billboards, and movie marquees. With its rivers of rippling neon and moving car lights, the spatially ambiguous nocturnal city can assume a fantastic, surreal aspect catering to the dreams and desires that photography has projected so alluringly on the movie screen and on the street. By both night and day, shop windows proclaim the sexualization of the urban environment as well as the increas-<lb/>
ingly public face of pornography. Former cityscapes of stone and brick and steel and glass are being transformed into the scenery of signs as virtuality overwhelms reality.</p>
<p>The city as an arena of human endeavor, community, and pleasure persists in spite of ugliness, suburban sprawl, and the rav-<lb/>
aging effect of the automobile upon its physical fabric and the expe-<lb/>
rience of place within it. Shopping as a form of entertainment is a hallmark of the consumer society, and even in the face of electronic commerce and catalogue merchandising, people still gravitate to Fifth Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard, and Michigan Avenue as well as the mall. Today the city of smokestack factories has given way to the city of commingled commerce and recreation.</p>
<p>And yet there is a sense of malaise and loss. The commodifi-<lb/>
cation of space and the ease with which nature and the built envi-<lb/>
ronment can be altered with heavy earthmoving and construction equipment have made the human bond with nature appear tenu-<lb/>
ous and the tie with the past seem fragile. Just as many of the mighty monuments intended for the ages now lie in ruins, so, too, are the architectural wonders of one generation torn down by the next. The commitment to create public places that express the val-<lb/>
ues of society has waned. Municipal governments in the United States are no longer able to sustain the parks they built only a cen-<lb/>
tury ago and must depend upon varying degrees of private citizen
<pb n="472"/>
<pb n="472" type="orig"/>
initiative to restore and help maintain them. Clearly, the notion that buildings and landscapes have any real permanence other than what we provide through repeated acts of maintenance and preserva-<lb/>
tion is wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Many people fear that the Faustian forces that have propelled modernity may be careening out of control. Humanity's relationship with nature has been thoroughly inverted. Having gained the tech-<lb/>
nological power Goethe foretold in <hi rend="italic">Faust, Part II</hi> and behaving no longer as nature's subjects, humans have acted ruthlessly, poisoned air and water, destroyed forests and wetlands, and caused many wild species to decline or become extinct. Because of this, contemporary society can now look back with a degree of horror on the nine-<lb/>
teenth- and twentieth-century belief in environmental engineering solely for human ends. Gone is the optimism and belief in technol-<lb/>
ogy as a worthy partner of nature as expressed by proponents of modernism such as <name type="pname">Benton MacKaye</name>, <name type="pname">Christopher Tunnard</name>, and <name type="pname">Garrett Eckbo</name> (see Chapters Twelve and Thirteen). Instead, the envi-<lb/>
ronmental movement, with its wide-ranging and sometimes intently focused mission of of planetary damage control, has gathered broad support within industrial nations since the <date when="1970">1970</date>s.</p>
<p>Like wilderness, historic landscapes exist on sufferance; some are protected by legislation but remain vulnerable to encroachment and destruction by economic and political forces. Especially in Amer-<lb/>
ica, where the citizenry has profligately exploited land and a mobile road culture has been a forceful determinant of land use, many once-<lb/>
handsome towns are both rammed through and rimmed by high-<lb/>
ways fringed with gas stations, fast-food franchise establishments, and other commercial operations with signs aggressively sized and illuminated to catch the eye of the rapidly moving motorist.</p>
<p>This willful eradication of much historic fabric in the twen-<lb/>
tieth century by transportation engineers and "urban renewal" plan-<lb/>
ners has brutalized cities to a far greater degree than Haussmann did nineteenth-century <name type="place">Paris</name>. Modernism's radical, intentional dis-<lb/>
regard for history created a palpable discontinuity with the past. In reaction, there arose a well-supported belief that traditional forms of architecture and urbanism are endangered. This helps account for the high regard in which landmark designation and preserva-<lb/>
tion are held today.</p>
<p>But just as environmental stewardship inevitably turns nature into the worthy ward of humanity, preservation of the built envi-<lb/>
ronment, an entirely laudable and overdue effort, has come to a sim-<lb/>
ilarly patronizing position. Formerly, we created monuments as symbols honoring a moral contract that present and future gener-<lb/>
ations hold with the values represented by past heroes. This has suc-<lb/>
cumbed to a fascination with history as a means of experiencing through architecture and artifacts the social and economic practices and lost craft skills of pretechnological times. While dependent upon automobile transportation and the modern technological service infrastructure that makes tourism possible, Colonial Williamsburg and its counterparts ably serve this purpose. Guides provide inter-<lb/>
pretive narratives that satisfy people's desire to sample vicariously a comfortable facsimile of life in bygone days. Theme parks also sim-<lb/>
ulate past environments for the same reasons, and today some his-<lb/>
toric small towns and urban centers are distinguished from these only by virtue of occupying an authentically historic site.</p>
<p>Reaction to the architecturally bland, commercially ingrati-<lb/>
ating, diffuse, and chaotic landscape of late-twentieth-century <name type="place">America</name>, coupled with a profound questioning of the established order of society and the discrediting of the symbolical value of tra-<lb/>
ditional monuments, provided the context for a Conceptual art that engaged viewers in considerations of entropy. Unlike theme-park developers who create a familiar product aimed at the mass con-<lb/>
sumer, the artists who create a novel poetics of place with large-<lb/>
scale transformations of the landscape do so in reaction to the values of the consumer society and what they perceive as the commodification of art. Implicit in their art is an attitude toward time in which "both past and future are placed into an objective pres-<lb/>
ent."<ref target="#CH15-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>The Earthworks movement pioneered by Robert Smithson and a group of fellow artists, who positioned themselves in oppo-<lb/>
sition to traditional modes of artistic expression and the institu-<lb/>
tional framework for displaying art, created a new kind of anti-<lb/>
monumental, monumental art that was "not built for the ages, but rather against the ages."<ref target="#CH15-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref>Within the context of a consumer soci-<lb/>
ety surfeited with banal products, Smithson and other Earthworks artists, like an earlier generation of Surrealist artists, saw denatured and dehumanized emptiness&#x2014;"a ‘City of the Future' made of null structures and surfaces, [which] performs no natural function [but] simply exists between mind and matter, detached from both, rep-<lb/>
resenting neither"<ref target="#CH15-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;as a metaphorically appropriate expression. In their work they fostered the spirit found in the literature of Latin American Magic Realists such as Jorge Luis Borges. They often sought sites for their projects in desert environments where, using heavy earthmoving equipment, they constructed, on a similar scale and often with the same cosmological relationship between earth and sky, forms like the mounds and other earthworks found in pre-<lb/>
historic ritual centers.</p>
<p>Today, we find an orientation toward the psychological and the empirical in contemporary Western thought and life. Intellec-<lb/>
tual focus is upon exegesis and fact collection. Contemporary West-<lb/>
ern culture, lacking an overarching, society-embracing religious or ideological construct, is obsessed with history and historical revi-<lb/>
sionism. It places emphasis upon personal experience, individual rights, and the self. Along with diaspora populations attempting to replicate old folkways and familiar environments, indigenous groups threatened by the rapid transformation of the familiar into the strange cling to traditional forms as a means of maintaining self-recognition and personal esteem. As cultural geographer David Lowenthal posits, because the contemporary world is beset with many ills and uncertainties, people "revert to ancestral legacies. As hopes of progress fade, heritage consoles us with tradition."<ref target="#CH15-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref> Our challenge today is to safeguard the future by turning our under-<lb/>
standing of the ephemeral nature of place to positive account, mak-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. Preserving the Past: Place as Heritage, Identity Tourist Landscape, and New Urbanist Community</hi></head>
<p>Landscape preservation is the process of investing cer-<lb/>
tain portions of environment, both designed spaces and vernacular places, with historical meaning, aes-<lb/>
thetic value, and symbolical intent. Because all built things and created artifacts alter and deteriorate over time, preservation almost invariably implies restora-<lb/>
tion. If what is preserved and restored embodies suf-<lb/>
ficient significance, beauty, and mythic value to serve as cultural heritage in a more universal sense, broad-<lb/>
scale reproduction and replication of the original his-<lb/>
toric forms in other contexts commonly occurs.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Preservation as Cultural Heritage</hi></head>
<p>The <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> State Building at the World's Columbian Exposition of <date when="1893">1893</date> in <name type="place">Chicago</name> was a fac-<lb/>
simile of Independence Hall in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, or rather an evocation of it, the replica being altered in scale and architectural program. Along with several other state buildings erected at the fair honoring (one year late) the four-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's landfall in <name type="place">America</name> and, by association the Founders of the republic, it helped further the Colonial Revival that had been sparked by the Centennial Exposition of <date when="1876">1876</date> in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. The Colonial Revival style was subsequently disseminated in tandem with the Neoclassical Beaux-Arts style, which was prominently featured in the monumental white buildings around <name type="pname">Daniel Burnham</name>'s Court of Honor (see fig. 9.56). The iconic and narrative value of landmark reproductions of Independence Hall and the entire design vocabu-<lb/>
lary of the <name type="pname">Colonial Revival</name> is obvious; the relatively brief history of the United States is attractively grounded in the myth it embodies of the simple refinement of an industrious, freedom-loving people. It is not surprising therefore to find many echoes of Independence Hall, Mount Vernon, and other shrines of liberty and national foundation in the pseudohis-<lb/>
toric architecture of the present. It is abundantly clear, too, why in Disney's Magic Kingdom, where the ener-<lb/>
getic wholesomeness of <name type="place">America</name> and its people is the paramount message of the entire theme park, that there should be a mint-condition reproduction of Independence Hall (fig. 15.1).</p>
<p>Historic preservation's role in signaling present values helps account for the persistence of "the styles" in spite of Modernism's polemic against them. Like the view into an endlessly self-reflecting set of mir-<lb/>
rors, these imitations of the past are often imitations of other earlier imitations of the past, and so on, a chainlike process in which old forms are continually reinvested with new meaning as present ideals are associated with past eras. Purged of political rancor and ordinary misery, the landscapes that project the mystique of former ages&#x2014;whether ancient Greece or colonial <name type="place">America</name>&#x2014;retain their hold on the human imagination, becoming totems of both status and ide-<lb/>
ology.</p>
<p>But heritage icons do not tap the more personal reservoirs of memory. <name type="pname">Kevin Lynch</name> (<date when="1918">1918</date>&#x2013;<date when="1984">1984</date>), an influential teacher, environmental design theorist, and thoughtful writer on the subject of place has sug-<lb/>
gested that "we might begin to commemorate the histories of ordinary people in ordinary places [inas-<lb/>
much as] local, intimate time has a much more pow-<lb/>
erful meaning for us than the illustrious time of national monuments."<ref target="#CH15-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref>Lynch was interested in tran-<lb/>
scending stasis, the "preserved-in-amber" quality of so much historic preservation. A more dynamic model of preservation that included the evidence of time&#x2014;the ebb and flow of events across a particular space&#x2014;would encode into cherished spaces notations of change; it would commemorate death and demise as well as birth and creation. Lynch's radical-sound-<lb/>
ing idea was "to conserve <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to destroy the physical environment so as to support and to enrich the sense of time held by the very people that use it."<ref target="#CH15-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p><name type="pname">Dolores Hayden</name>, professor of Architecture, Urbanism, and American Studies at Yale University, shares Lynch's concern to discover strategies for investing ordinary places with commemorative value as a means of connecting the lives of ordinary peo-<lb/>
ple to their immediate surroundings. Hayden worked
<pb n="474"/>
<pb n="474" type="orig"/>
over a period of eight years "to situate women's his-<lb/>
tory and ethnic history in downtown [<name type="place">Los Angeles</name>], in public places, through experimental, collaborative projects by historians, designers, and artists."<ref target="#CH15-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> The efforts of Hayden and others have been helped by a changing cultural climate that seeks, however imper-<lb/>
fectly at times, to respect equally the contributions to society of both sexes and to honor the heroines and heroes of many different ethnic backgrounds. The stubborn fact remains that much preservation senti-<lb/>
ment adheres especially to those outstanding indi-<lb/>
vidual buildings, cityscapes, and landscapes where substantial past investment of money and design tal-<lb/>
ent was made by people who were prominent in their time. In addition, despite a contemporary disinclina-<lb/>
tion toward heroic sentiment and religious and patri-<lb/>
otic public monuments, some of the ideals and values of the past that are expressed in historically preserved landscapes often continue to hold important sym-<lb/>
bolical meaning for people today.</p>
<p>Closely allied with preservation as a means of assigning commemorative value to the built envi-<lb/>
ronment, conservation is the protection of natural areas from despoliation by human activity that harms essential qualities of place and the habitats of other species. Both preservation and conservation emerged as important causes in the second part of the nine-<lb/>
teenth century. Since the <date when="1960">1960</date>s&#x2014;a period of wide-<lb/>
spread social and political change fostering populism and democratic empowerment&#x2014;recognition of tremendous population growth and the dire conse-<lb/>
quences of rampant development and unchecked industrial pollution have given impetus to organized movements that continue to advance the related causes of preservation and conservation.</p>
<p>Although conservation groups often have an anti-urban bias and are therefore indifferent to issues regarding the design of cities, both forces&#x2014;preserva-<lb/>
tion and conservation&#x2014;are essential to a landscape ethic that values the environment as a continuum in which nature is rightly perceived as being everywhere, in the densest urban neighborhoods as well as in the wilderness. To achieve a viable landscape ethic based on this integrated perspective it is also necessary to accept and help shape new industrial development, the mainstay of most modern economies and the means of sustaining decent living standards among the masses. There is hope that the reportorial power of new global information systems and the management capabilities made possible by computer technology and the Internet will assist in creating this necessary ethic of responsible total planetary stewardship. Our task here is to advocate that outcome as we examine how preservation and conservation have affected land-<lb/>
scape as a place-making enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Preservation as Cultural Identity</hi></head>
<p>Cultures in transition are pulled in two directions, enthusiastically toward the future and nostalgically toward the past. Especially in times of great techno-<lb/>
logical change, economic stress, and social disloca-<lb/>
tion, people entertain fantasies of recovering the past, a time when they imagine that life was simpler and more rewarding, craftskills were honest, people were prosperous, and communities lived in harmony. Although this is a thoroughly edited version of his-<lb/>
tory, the trappings of the past provide useful symbols for the present. The artifacts, architecture, and land-<lb/>
scapes of a bygone era are invested with value and meaning, becoming the delight of historians and con-<lb/>
noisseurs as well as the icons of embattled gentility. There is a moral dimension and educative element to this process, which seeks to make reverence for ances-<lb/>
tral forms and older lifeways a rallying point around which values of nation and community can cohere.</p>
<p>The <name type="place">New England</name> town, whose origins we examined in Chapter Six, reached its apogee between <date when="1780">1780</date> and <date when="1830">1830</date>, during <name type="place">America</name>'s early industrial age.<ref target="#CH15-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> Nestled in hilly and mountainous terrain, most <name type="place">New England</name> towns were subsequently bypassed by eco-<lb/>
nomic development, becoming depopulated back-<lb/>
waters as railroads sought more accessible routes and extended farther west, causing emigration to larger industrial centers and richer agricultural lands. But by the middle of the nineteenth century, wealthy peo-<lb/>
ple from <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">Boston</name> began to establish themselves in summer colonies in <name type="place">Stockbridge</name>, <name type="place">Mass-<lb/>
achusetts</name>, and other towns of the Berkshires as well as elsewhere. These affluent part-time citizens helped form Village Improvement Societies for the purpose of planting trees along the towns' principal thor-<lb/>
oughfares and transforming into grassy, parklike pic-<lb/>
turesqueness their central commons, which had been pastures in Puritan times and remained mostly bar-<lb/>
ren, utilitarian, workaday spaces until this landscap-<lb/>
ing was undertaken.</p>
<p>During his brief but influential career, <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson</name> Downing was an early proselytizer for the beautification of towns and villages in this way. In Downing's time, the mid-nineteenth century, houses were adorned with brackets and painted in then-fash-<lb/>
ionable russet browns and other earth-tone colors. But following the Centennial of <date when="1876">1876</date>, as the country began its race toward large-scale industrialization, the early preservationists who were tastemakers within these venerable communities&#x2014;an alliance of sum-<lb/>
mer residents and well-to-do natives who shared the same Anglo-Saxon ethnic origins&#x2014;sought to con-<lb/>
nect themselves ideologically and symbolically with the nation's beginnings by adopting a more chaste, though elegant, architecture style harking back to the
<pb n="475"/>
<pb n="475" type="orig"/>
colonial and federal periods. In Litchfield, Connecti-<lb/>
cut, for instance, residents reproduced Colonial-style houses, which they painted white, although the orig-<lb/>
inal models were mostly unpainted, with shutters and trim of handsomely contrasting black or dark green. Outbuildings, barns, and other unprepossessing rural paraphernalia that had once surrounded the actual colonial houses were edited out of the restoration program. To commemorate the nation's Centennial, Litchfield's Village Improvement Society planted reg-<lb/>
ularly spaced elm trees, whose overarching branches soon canopied the main street. In this way, Litchfield, along with <name type="pname">Sharon</name>, <name type="place">Stockbridge</name>, and other early examples of gentrification throughout <name type="place">New England</name> projected a composite image of an earlier <name type="place">America</name>, a place that was gracious, green, white, and steepled.</p>
<p>There was an escapist element in this kind of historic preservation, a flight from the problems of the swelling industrial cities with their diverse immi-<lb/>
grant populations. There was an element of snob-<lb/>
bery, too; the Colonial theme expressed the assertion of primacy on the part of the old guard, a means of securing status and respect within the rapidly chang-<lb/>
ing society. Beneath its veneer of republican virtue and communal decorum, inevitable tensions arose between those mostly well-to-do residents with incomes often derived from industrial enterprises else-<lb/>
where and local townspeople who valued historical ambiance less than economic development.</p>
<p>The re-created <name type="place">New England</name> town assumed iconic status in the imaginations of many Americans, becoming a symbol of the prosperous, homoge-<lb/>
neous, nuclear community of individuals living in a state of friendly symbiosis. Its architectural forms served as a common vocabulary employed by devel-<lb/>
opers of early malls and subdivisions, as we have seen in our discussion of Levittown with its Cape Cod Colonial houses built around a series of "Village Greens." Appropriated by hotel chains and corporate franchises, the Colonial Revival style became a ubiq-<lb/>
uitous language, a means of fostering consumer trust by linking particular commercial corporations with patriotic sentiment.</p>
<p>The same forces that stimulated the preserva-<lb/>
tion movement in <name type="place">New England</name> promoted citizen efforts to save historic landscapes in the Old South and other parts of the country. Often these were led by women, many of whom belonged to genealogi-<lb/>
cally oriented organizations such as the Colonial Dames or the Daughters of the Texas Republic (pre-<lb/>
servers and custodians of the Alamo). In <date when="1931">1931</date>, <name type="place">Charleston</name>, <name type="place">South Carolina</name>, passed the first perma-<lb/>
nent design-review ordinance, mandating that private property owners within the designated historic area submit proposed alteration schemes for approval.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for colonial heritage extended to other than its Anglo-Saxon Protestant forms. In <name type="place">Cal-<lb/>
ifornia</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, <name type="place">Texas</name>, and <name type="place">Florida</name>, Anglo-Amer-<lb/>
icans appropriated a Spanish Colonial design idiom, which they romanticized as the Mission Style, while residents in <name type="place">Louisiana</name> looked appreciatively toward the residue of a French Colonial past. By the mid-<lb/>
<date when="1950">1950</date>s, about ten American cities, including <name type="place">Santa Barbara</name> and <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, had historic districts. This kind of preservation, like the yet-to-be-conceived theme park, treated landscape as historical narrative, with emphasis upon those parts of the story that were most attractive and laudable, omitting those, such as slavery, that caused embarrassment.</p>
<p>Restoration along approved lines in historic dis-<lb/>
tricts has led to wide replication of historic forms. In some places, this process has also become an exercise in genteel mythmaking in which restrictive covenants and a stringent building-approval process have codi-<lb/>
fied design, resulting in the wholesale manufacture of regional cultural identity by architects and builders through the creation of a romanticized landscape of the past. Notable in this regard, <name type="pname">Santa Fe</name>, <name type="place">New Mex-<lb/>
ico</name>, is a place where people of Anglo-Saxon stock dwell in adobe houses that are commodious versions of older Hispanic models, which in turn were derived from the architecture and building materials of Native American pueblos.<ref target="#CH15-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> Few people seem to mind the faux-adobe gas stations and shopping centers on the highway, but some Hispanics and Native Americans understandably resent the hegemonic appropriation of cultural heritage and landscape by non-natives who wear the city's much-transformed design tradition like a colorful shawl while often considering its living representatives to be an underclass. But there is a candy coating, economically speaking, on outsider-<lb/>
financed, highly interpretive historic preservation: Cities such as Santa Fe that have cultivated their his-<lb/>
toric image in this way are tourist magnets. Having denied themselves the opportunity to transform their cultural landscape, they grow prosperous from the trade of visitors.</p>

Shurcliff</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>), the landscape-architect member of Rockefeller's Colo-<lb/>
nial Williamsburg planning team, developed his restoration designs in a highly interpretive manner.<ref target="#CH15-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> The wife of Williamsburg's mayor described his vig-<lb/>
orous revision of the local scenery in this diary entry:
<q><date when="1931-05-22">May 22, 1931</date>b. <name type="pname">Mr. Shurcliff</name> came down like a wolf on the fold again today. He rushed in and out several times with charts and plans for all sorts of alarming "landscapes" in our yard. He has boxwood on the brain. . . . <name type="pname">Mr. Shurcliff</name> is hurt and grieved by our lack of appreciation when we declare that we don't want more box-<lb/>
wood mazes and hedges all over our yard!<ref target="#CH15-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>Nevertheless, she found all the transplanting and lay-<lb/>
ing out of trim brick walks a fascinating spectacle. With a substantial budget for maintenance, Colonial Williamsburg's re-created gardens have enjoyed a showcase level of seasonal display and year-round degree of neatness that would have been impossible in the case of the originals (fig. 15.2).<ref target="#CH15-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The tendency to embellish the physical evidence of the past in the act of preservation and restoration reflects the homage we pay to the memories or myths it embodies. The impulse to suffuse with the golden light of a romantically recalled yesteryear the restored or re-created landscapes of today accounts for the glossy, picture-perfect quality of Disney's theme parks and Colonial Williamsburg. It also accounts for the setlike quality of Celebration, <name type="place">Florida</name>, the new town that was financed, built, and marketed by the Disney Company, a symbolic landscape where every day is yesterday, or rather the same yesteryear of nostalgi-<lb/>
cally recalled time (fig. 15.3). Celebration's neotradi-<lb/>
tional postmodern planners took their cue from the predominant period-and-place theme of Disneyland's Main Street, the imaginary golden-age paradise of the Midwestern small town as it was from the end of the nineteenth century through the first four decades of the twentieth century. As with the impulse toward nostalgia we have observed in the Arts and Crafts Movement, this kind of architectural eclecticism reflects a denial of the powerful prevailing forces of the industrial age and the yearning for an earlier, sim-<lb/>
pler time when, so it is presumed, neighbors were neighborly and people led lives rich in the common-<lb/>
place pleasures of community. Governmentally con-<lb/>
trolled by its parent corporation, Celebration is a well-publicized and highly contested example of the historically flavored lifestyle communities that other developers are also offering to home buyers under the planning rubric of New Urbanism. More than cos-<lb/>
metic in intent, these communities are the most recent experiments in applying to the now vastly dis-<lb/>
tended amorphous metropolitan realm some of the practical principles underlying workable, livable cities that were articulated by <name type="pname">Jane Jacobs</name> and other critics of American planning practice in the late <date when="1950">1950</date>s and early <date when="1960">1960</date>s.</p>

<p>While the urge to validate our present lives by link-<lb/>
ing them to past tradition is necessary to our psy-<lb/>
chological well-being, preservationism is more than architectural appreciation, ancestral piety, or simple nostalgia. The polemic that <name type="pname">Jane Jacobs</name> (b. <date when="1916">1916</date>) hurled against urban renewal in her classic <hi rend="italic">Death and Life of Great American Cities</hi> (<date when="1961">1961</date>) was the cry of a preservationist who prized traditional urbanism not because of aesthetics or any particular regard for his-<lb/>
tory <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> Her preservationism was not the same as that of the gen-<lb/>
tility-seeking social striver or the gentrifying homeowner in a reviving slum neighborhood.</p>
<p>As we observed in Chapter Twelve, Jacobs pro-<lb/>
moted the street patterns and land use of the old nineteenth-century city, with its sidewalks and ground-floor businesses where people were in con-<lb/>
tinual visual communication. The resulting environ-<lb/>
ment was safer and more socially vibrant than the one of single-use zoning, large-scale superblocks, and superhighways that authoritarian master planners were imposing on the cities of <name type="place">America</name>. The segre-<lb/>
gation of land uses by zoning districts had become common practice after streetcar- and, later, automo-<lb/>
bile-served suburbs made it possible for people to live and work in widely separated locations. By the late <date when="1950">1950</date>s, mass automobile ownership and the federal highway building program had accelerated suburban expansion, and commuting had become common-<lb/>
place in metropolitan <name type="place">America</name>. Middle-class, in-city living virtually disappeared except in a few culturally rich older cities such as <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">Boston</name>.</p>
<p>Jacobs's thesis flew in the face of the conven-<lb/>
tional wisdom that had created these landscapes. With a journalist's keen eye for detail and practical com-<lb/>
mon sense, she concluded that a mix of uses created good neighborhoods such as the one where she and her family lived in Greenwich Village. She held that effectively recycled old housing stock made better homes for the poor than high-rise projects where pub-<lb/>
lic space was green but grim, being generally unsafe. One could learn lessons from the structure of the his-<lb/>
toric tenement street despite the evils of unsanitary crowding in tenement houses.</p>
<p>Jacobs's words, unappreciated in planning cir-<lb/>
cles at the time, have taken on an increasingly reso-<lb/>
nant ring of useful truth. Having fought the battle to save Soho, the warehouse district in Lower Manhat-<lb/>
tan, from destruction by <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>'s planned Lower Manhattan Expressway, she became the pro-<lb/>
genitor of its renaissance, which sparked the conver-<lb/>
sion of semi-abandoned industrial districts in other cities into zones of yeasty enterprise, filled with art galleries, boutiques, restaurants, and loft apartments.</p>
<p>Today, practitioners of the New Urbanism adhere to planning principles based largely on Jacobs's ideas as they seek to apply pedestrian-oriented, mixed-<lb/>
use planning principles in rectifying the flaws they per-<lb/>
ceive in the current monotonous, sprawling suburban landscape and deteriorated parts of older cities where opportunities exist to recycle real estate and replan neighborhoods. <name type="pname">Andres Duany</name> (b. <date when="1950">1950</date>) and <name type="pname">Eliza-<lb/>
beth Plater-Zyberk</name> (b. <date when="1950">1950</date>), who head the architec-<lb/>
tural firm DPZ, and <name type="pname">Peter Calthorpe</name> (b. <date when="1949">1949</date>) of Calthorpe Associates are prominent apostles of the <name type="place">New Urbanism</name>. Their overriding goal is to re-create lost opportunities for community by disciplining the automobile and establishing the primacy of the pub-<lb/>
lic realm. For New Urbanists, streets are both the communal rooms and the passages of the city. By dethroning "King Car" as the ruler of surburbia and disavowing the conventional approach of trans-<lb/>
portation planners whose primary motive is to move automobile traffic efficiently, they have revalued the street as an important public space for people. To accomplish this, they have revived the street's historic appendage, the sidewalk, a fixture of older cities and their streetcar suburbs. They plan neighborhoods that organize building sites and traffic on a hierarchical network of streets. These are made as narrow as pos-<lb/>
sible as a means of slowing down automobile traffic. Curbside parking replaces large off-site parking lots, and trees shade cars and make them less conspicuous.</p>
<p>New Urbanist plans are compact in scale, with higher densities per acre than conventional suburbs, so that schools and shops are within comfortable walking distances, one-quarter-mile&#x2014;a "five-minute walk"&#x2014;being the radius DPZ considers appropriate for development extension in any direction from the neighborhood center. Families therefore do not have to maintain more than one car, children do not have to be chauffeured or bused to school, and elderly peo-<lb/>
ple who no longer drive do not have to move away but can still lead independent lives.</p>
<p>Public space in New Urbanist communities also takes the form of village greens, the long-lasting lega-<lb/>
cies of the <name type="place">New England</name> town commons. Like sidewalks, these promote face-to-face encounters, thereby stimulating the spirit of community. Unlike traditional modern suburbs where parks, if they exist at all, are randomly sited on residual pieces of land not suitable for residential development, these greens are central elements within the plan, nuclei for surrounding development. They become identifiable town cen-<lb/>
ters, well defined architecturally by their surround-<lb/>
ing buildings. These may consist of the local school, the town hall, the retail center, town houses, apart-<lb/>
ments, and offices, usually in combination since mixed use is a cardinal rule in New Urbanist planning.</p>

</figure>
<p>Mixed use means that there is more demographic diversity and more mutual interaction among popu-<lb/>
lation groups within a New Urbanist community than in a typical suburb. The pedestrian-oriented town cen-<lb/>
ter is a lively place because its ground-floor shops, restaurants, and services attract patrons from the entire community.</p>
<p>Perimeter parks, or at least natural borders, are also important in the New Urbanist developments. Edges that define and contain districts and the town itself are as important as the town center in over-<lb/>
coming the perception that has caused critics of con-<lb/>
ventional suburbs to echo Gertrude Stein's characterization of Oakland, California, as having "no ‘there,' there." In Calthorpe's thinking especially, a regional planning perspective predominates. It is akin to the perspective of <name type="pname">Benton MacKaye</name>, the Regional Planning Association of <name type="place">America</name>'s advocate of direct-<lb/>
ing metropolitan growth into a series of greenbelt-<lb/>
surrounded new towns modeled on the historic ones of <name type="place">New England</name> (see Chapter Twelve). The Regional Plan Association (RPA), which has sought to guide <name type="place">New York</name>'s metropolitan growth since the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, now subscribes to the New Urbanist notion of nodal urbanism. Calthorpe and the current leadership of RPA see the revival of the light-rail transit systems that were competitively dismantled by the automo-<lb/>
bile and highway interests after World War II as essen-<lb/>
tial to overcoming suburban sprawl and preserving regional nature in any significant way.</p>
<p>New Urbanist planners maintain that design is meant to ensure a public realm, not to revive styles. But older models inspire much of their work, and they demonstrate a strong interest in design detail. Finding the results of Modernist planning bleak and dehumanizing and individualistic works of high-art architecture to be posturing, they seek to reproduce the highly textured building fabric characteristic of older cities, adopting as well the more contextual, con-<lb/>
sensual approach of premodern architects. Duany and Plater-Zyberk label their method "TND," for <hi rend="italic">tra-<lb/>
ditional neighborhood development,</hi> and Calthorpe calls his "TOD," or <hi rend="italic">transit-oriented development,</hi> because of its emphasis on a building density capable of sup-<lb/>
porting capital investment in transit infrastructure. Both produce results that are informed by ideas derived from Beaux-Arts Neoclassicism and the ver-<lb/>
nacular architecture of streetcar suburbs.</p>
<p>This community design for Laguna West, Sacramento County, <name type="place">California</name>, is based on TOD (transit-oriented development) principles (fig. 15.4). Here, planner <name type="place">Peter Calthorpe</name> has applied the <hi rend="italic">patte d'oie,</hi> or goosefoot, pattern of avenue radials derived from seventeenth-century French garden design and subsequently appropriated by eighteenth-, nineteenth-<lb/>
, and early twentieth-century city planners to rein-<lb/>
force the centrality of the hub&#x2014;the 100-acre town center with its cluster of shops, offices, apartments, and cultural and recreational facilities. Although light-<lb/>
-rail transit does not yet exist at Laguna West, Calthorpe's plan presupposes its arrival by creating sufficient urban density to support this kind of trans-<lb/>
portation system. It also caters to the still-existing large market for more traditional suburban-style homes with a broad outer residential band platted according to the pattern of gently curving streets ending in cul-<lb/>
de-sacs, which has been typical of American subdivi-<lb/>
sions built since World War II.</p>
<p>Although it is only a small resort community occupying 80 acres of land on the Gulf Coast of <name type="place">Florida</name>, Seaside, the town planned by <name type="pname">Duany</name> and <name type="pname">Plater-Zyberk</name> and developed by an especially sym-<lb/>

<pb n="479" type="orig"/>
pathetic client, <name type="pname">Robert Davis</name>, who also participated in its design, has garnered media attention as a lead-<lb/>
ing example of New Urbanism (fig. 15.5). The three observed the beach cottages in Seagrove Beach, <name type="place">Florida</name>, and other Gulf coastal summer colonies and traveled to suburbs in Southern cities where they stud-<lb/>
ied residential architecture types. They sharpened their appreciation of traditional and vernacular styles, noting, for instance, how Charleston's distinctive his-<lb/>
toric house type with its long side porches on two floors is an architecturally pleasing adaptation to cli-<lb/>
mate. The old-fashioned veranda, which had disap-<lb/>
peared with the advent of air-conditioning and newer suburban house types, also drew their admiration. Influential in their revaluation of these past plans and building types was the teaching of <name type="pname">Leon Krier</name> (b. <date when="1946">1946</date>), the Luxembourg-born architect who has led the crusade in <name type="place">London</name> and elsewhere to revive neo-<lb/>
classical and vernacular approaches to community development.</p>

</figure>
<p>The town plan, the Seaside Urban Code, and the Construction Regulations are simultaneously spe-<lb/>
cific and flexible architectural directives that ensure compatibility among neighboring building types by giving guidelines for eight categories of construction and by specifying how structures are positioned on the lot and with regard to the street. Prescribed build-<lb/>
ing types range from arcaded, party-wall, three-to-<lb/>
five-story buildings for stores and apartments in the Downtown Commercial Square to single-family "Classic-Romantic urban villas" on Seaside Avenue to southern bungalows and side-yard single houses on the residential streets elsewhere. The code encour-<lb/>
ages the construction of "carriage houses" &#x2014; free-<lb/>
standing garages with living quarters above &#x2014; as small apartments for elderly relatives, house guests, or rental tenants. The regulations further control specific build-<lb/>
ing materials and practices; they mandate, for instance, metal roofing, wood siding, exposed rafter ends, and operable wood-framed windows.</p>
<p>Seaside's prime real estate, a high dune bluff directly fronting on a magnificent stretch of white sand and the azure water of the Gulf of <name type="place">Mexico</name>, could have been profitably exploited by the developer if he had chosen to sell the entire strip as individual high-<lb/>
priced large lots. Instead, holding the value&#x2014;eco-<lb/>
nomic as well as social&#x2014;of the entire project as paramount, Davis and DPZ made the beachfront property into a shared amenity. On the Gulf side of the highway that runs through Seaside they provided access points, which they marked with gazebos where stepped causeways begin their staged descent across the vegetated dune landscape leading to the beach (fig. 15.6). These have seating, another means of fostering the community's atmosphere of low-key sociability.</p>

<p>Running like a leitmotif throughout Seaside is a unifying vocabulary of white-painted wooden ele-<lb/>
ments&#x2014;picket fences, porch and balcony railings, lattices, gazebos, and window and door frames (fig. 15.7). The ground plane is a well-crafted mix of tex-<lb/>
tures; there are brick-paved principal streets with crushed-shell margins for parked cars and sandy mid-<lb/>
block footpaths leading to the beach. Designed by dif-<lb/>
ferent architects&#x2014;some of whom may bend the rules to express their personal visions&#x2014;and by general con-<lb/>
tractors who simply follow the code and regulations, Seaside's compactly clustered mass of structures, often derided as "cute," are above all congenial. Although neotraditional, their design is the result of a somewhat more flexible approach than is the case at Celebration, where Disney's architects have pro-<lb/>
vided a pattern book for builders to follow in order to achieve the look of pre-World War II suburbs with their mix of Neoclassical and vernacular styles (see fig. 15.3). One of Seaside's most important results in addition to stressing the values of community is its sense of containment. By setting appropriate limits to size and by thinking about centers and edges, <name type="pname">Duany</name> and <name type="pname">Plater-Zyberk</name> have made preservation of traditional community values and preservation of the natural environment complementary. Their critics maintain that the New Urbanism is merely a pallia-<lb/>
tive that has not yet addressed the fundamental and politically complicated issues of reforming the real-<lb/>
estate financing practices and other factors that encourage suburban sprawl and foster urban blight.</p>
<p>It is doubtful that Jane Jacobs envisioned any-<lb/>
thing resembling Seaside when she wrote <hi rend="italic">Death and Life of Great American Cities.</hi> The New Urbanism may be showing middle-class <name type="place">America</name> the way back to the future, but as a movement it is still tentative. <name type="pname">Davis</name>'s bet on community-ori-<lb/>
ented planning is paying off handsomely in terms of Seaside's real estate market, which is geared to the buyers of second homes, but pockets of genteel affluence, however community-oriented in their physical structure, do not create the real social diversity Jacobs observed in cities. New Urban-<lb/>
ist projects are achieving some impressive results in older cities such as Providence, Rhode Island; never-<lb/>
theless, many of the people who need it most&#x2014;for instance, the underfunded community groups who are waging battles to preserve urban fabric and com-<lb/>
munity spirit in <name type="place">New York</name> City's South Bronx&#x2014;are struggling to find the private capital or government support to produce tangible results where they live.</p>
<p>For Jacobs, "projects" and "big money" were antithetical to the ideal community, in which social vibrancy and energetic consensus are achieved because numerous individual investments of time and money define the character of the urban space. "The cities of human beings are as natural, being a prod-<lb/>
uct of one form of nature, as are the colonies of prairie dogs or the beds of oysters."<ref target="#CH15-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> Thus wrote <name type="pname">Jane Jacobs</name> in <date when="1961">1961</date> a year before <name type="pname">Rachel Carson</name> published <hi rend="italic">Silent Spring,</hi> which heralded the environmental movement in the United States.

ety was inflicting upon the planet, when environ-<lb/>
mental organizations came into being in the <date when="1970">1970</date>s it was often with agendas that portrayed humankind as nature's enemy. Feeding this bias was the persistent strain of anti-urbanism that runs deep within Amer-<lb/>
ican culture. Many people still believe the densely built-up older city cherished by <name type="pname">Jacobs</name> and others to be an inimical, inhuman environment that exists apart from nature. But, as Jacobs pointed out, "Human beings are, of course, a part of nature, as much so as grizzly bears or bees."<ref target="#CH15-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> The suburban movement that spawned the current urban sprawl that she fore-<lb/>

planning more livable suburbs, revitalizing old in-city neighborhoods, and saving natural areas as greenbelts, the New Urbanists appear to understand that the human environment and the natural environment are fundamentally one&#x2014;an inextricable alliance of art, technology, and nature. The question remains: can we in fact build better cities, ones that do not oblit-<lb/>
erate but rather incorporate nature for our sake as well as for its own intrinsic, noneconomic worth? And can we accomplish this within the context of better regional planning, revitalizing historic cities as well as building better suburban towns? This is the true chal-<lb/>

<head>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Conserving Nature: Landscape Design as Environmental Science and Art</hi></head>
<p>The roots of today's environmental consciousness lie in nineteenth-century earth science. In <date when="1863">1863</date>, the British geologist Charles Lyell (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875">1875</date>) published <hi rend="italic">Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man.</hi> <name type="pname">Charles Darwin</name> (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) was aware of Lyell's work, which promoted and helped confirm his theory of evolu-<lb/>
tionary biology as in <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> (<date when="1859">1859</date>). The observations recorded by the German naturalist and explorer <name type="pname">Alexander von Humboldt</name> (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>) dur-<lb/>
ing his voyages to <name type="place">South America</name>, <name type="place">Cuba</name>, and <name type="place">Mexico</name> advanced the nascent field of ecology. Early geogra-<lb/>
phers such as the <name type="pname">German Karl Ritter</name> (<date when="1779">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>) and the <name type="pname">Swiss-born Arnold Henry Guyot</name> (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884">1884</date>) studied the earth in relation to human activity. But it was an American, <name type="pname">George Perkins Marsh</name> (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>), who attempted to show the extent to which human intervention was altering climate, topography, vege-<lb/>
tation patterns, soil, and the habitats of species, often with consequences inimical for future generations. In his landmark book <hi rend="italic">Man and Nature</hi> (<date when="1864">1864</date>) Marsh, who claimed no scientific expertise but a great deal of prac-<lb/>
tical experience as a farmer, industrial investor, and diplomatic traveler, set out to show "that whereas Rit-<lb/>
ter and Guyot think that the earth made man, man in fact made the earth."<ref target="#CH15-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>A native of Vermont, Marsh saw firsthand how clear-cutting of forested slopes had promoted erosion and how these actions had caused the silting of for-<lb/>
mer wetlands and decimated many animal species. In biblical cadences, Marsh described how man the destroyer of nature
<q>has felled forests whose network of fibrous roots bound the mould to the rocky skeleton of the earth,... has broken up the mountain reser-<lb/>
voirs, the percolation of whose waters through unseen channels supplied the fountains that refreshed his cattle and fertilized his fields, . . . has torn the thin glebe which confined the light earth of extensive plains, and has destroyed the fringe of semi-aquatic plants which skirted the coast and checked the drifting of sea sand, . . . has warred on all the tribes of animated nature whose spoil he could not convert to his own uses, and... not protected the birds which prey on the insects most destructive to his own har-<lb/>
vests.<ref target="#CH15-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>Fluent in several foreign languages, both ancient and modern, he read extensively and, as an ambassa-<lb/>
dor first to Turkey and then <name type="place">Italy</name>, he was able to ana-<lb/>
lyze the Mediterranean basin at close range and to surmise why certain areas that had once supported extensive human settlement were now rocky, treeless, arid wastes, inhospitable to human life. By under-<lb/>
standing how the exploitation of the land's resources in the Old World, without any thought of husbandry beyond the immediate term, had reduced such significant portions of the ancient Roman empire to this condition, Marsh hoped to encourage his country-<lb/>
men to reconsider their heedless scramble for wealth at the expense of nature and to develop an ethos of land stewardship. The challenge that he put forth was to take his empirical observations in <hi rend="italic">Man and Nature</hi> as warning signs and to assemble the necessary sci-<lb/>
entific data to understand "the action and reaction between humanity and the material world around it." Only by so doing would humanity be able to deter-<lb/>
mine at last "the great question, whether man is of nature or above her."<ref target="#CH15-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Marsh fully approved of canals, dikes, river embankments, and other means of engineering that channeled the forces of nature toward human ends. But he believed that such controls could be produc-<lb/>
tive in the long term only if nature's regenerative forces were encouraged, not stymied. His book was influential in begetting awareness of the environment as an organic system in which all the parts were inter-<lb/>
dependent. Motives of overweening human greed persisted in his day as they do in ours, and in an aside, he railed against "the decay of commercial morality" and "unprincipled corporations, which not only defy the legislative power, but have, too often, corrupted even the administration of justice."<ref target="#CH15-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref>Although his urgent message sowed the seeds of forestry and land management practices that eventually became part
<pb n="482"/>
<pb n="482" type="orig"/>
of government, only in recent years have the dire effects that Marsh predicted&#x2014;multiplied by pressures of population growth and forces of industrial mech-<lb/>
anization that he could hardly have imagined&#x2014;prompted political protest and legislative actions leading to pollution controls and some positive steps toward the responsible regeneration of degraded nat-<lb/>
ural environments.</p>
<p>As we have seen, inherent in modernism was a celebratory attitude toward feats of engineering and little regard for their environmental consequences. Although modernist landscape architects following Christopher Tunnard intended and usually inflicted no serious environmental harm, their objectives were essentially aesthetic as they wished to bring their pro-<lb/>
fession in line with the exciting new developments in architecture, painting, and sculpture. In terms of plan-<lb/>
ning, the urban-rural balance that Lewis Mumford preached in opposition to metropolitanism, with greenbelt communities scattered throughout a region, went generally unheeded. Only since the <date when="1970">1970</date>s has a belated awareness of the need to reconcile human objectives with the operation of natural ecosystems become general and influential upon the practice of landscape design. It was at the University of Pennsyl-<lb/>
vania where Mumford taught for a period in the early <date when="1960">1960</date>s that the ground was laid for a landscape archi-<lb/>
tecture that conjoined the regionalism of the <date when="1920">1920</date>s with the emerging environmental consciousness.</p>

science in <hi rend="italic">Silent Spring</hi> (<date when="1962">1962</date>), McHarg articulated with similar fervor a conservation strategy that sought to unseat the mind-set condoned by the <name type="pname">Judeo-Chris-<lb/>
tian</name> biblical injunction encouraging humanity to sub-<lb/>
due the earth. He enjoined planners, developers, and landscape architects to view Earth not as an exploitable resource but as the very source of life, the terrestrial miracle in space, an intricate organism of which humanity is an inseparable part. A gifted teacher, as chairman of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of Pennsylvania from <date when="1964">1964</date> until <date when="1986">1986</date>, <name type="pname">McHarg</name> became a leading exponent of an enlightened land-<lb/>
planning strategy that sought to make the constraints and opportunities presented by natural ecosystems an integral part of design and development. Inform-<lb/>
ing his philosophy is his personal experience of the contrast of countryside to industrial city, of wartime landscape devastation to great landscape beauty, and of post-World War II convalescence in both grim and exhilarating environments.</p>
<p>As a landscape architect, McHarg came to feel that it was not enough to simply ameliorate the con-<lb/>
ditions found in the Glasgow slums of his youth. Prac-<lb/>
ticing in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in the firm he founded in <date when="1963">1963</date>, he recognized that "providing a decorative background for human play"<ref target="#CH15-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref>did not address the larger environ-<lb/>
mental threat posed by rings of suburbs encroaching upon rural and wild landscapes and the increasing divorce of human beings from wild nature. Further, the environment as a whole was being made toxic with pesticides and industrial wastes, and by then humans had sown the dire seeds of massive planetary devastation by producing the atomic bomb. He believes that urban planners and landscape architects can significantly alter this supremely dangerous course of science and technology and stem the harmful forces within industrial capitalist society.</p>
<p>As we have seen, other landscape architects&#x2014; notably <name type="pname">Charles Eliot</name> and <name type="pname">Jens Jensen</name>&#x2014;had preceded McHarg in advancing the cause of nature preserves in metropolitan areas, in studying native plant ecolo-<lb/>
gies, and in forging a design idiom that expressed the simple beauties of regional locality. Stanley White (<date when="1891">1891</date>&#x2013;<date when="1979">1979</date>) and <name type="pname">Hideo Sasaki</name> (b. <date when="1919">1919</date>), both gifted teachers of landscape architecture, were instrumen-<lb/>
tal in bringing environmental science into the student curriculum. For instance, Sasaki had his Harvard stu-<lb/>
dents study a site in terms of its soil conditions, drainage patterns, and vegetation character and ground-plane coverage. These then became the deter-<lb/>
minants in locating development and assigning preser-<lb/>
vation value. To this analytical approach based on principles of ecological determinism, McHarg added an intuitive methodology incorporating personal val-<lb/>
ues that evinced his affinity for Japanese culture and the metaphysics expressed in the Zen garden as well as his respect for the architecture of Louis Kahn (<date when="1901">1901</date>&#x2013;<date when="1974">1974</date>), who taught architecture at the Univer-<lb/>
sity of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> when <name type="pname">McHarg</name> led the landscape architecture program there. <name type="pname">McHarg</name> appreciated Kahn's notion of design as a poetic expression of space and light and of the essential, inherent qualities of material and site.</p>
<p>In an age of scientific rationalism that puts a premium on nonsubjective measures, <name type="pname">McHarg</name> felt compelled to further a science-based approach to designing with nature. He made the natural sciences an essential foundation for his department's curricu-<lb/>
lum at the University of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, with courses in plant ecology and geology. In his geophysical and environmental approach to landscape design, <name type="pname">McHarg</name> developed a coordinated mapping system with overlays to render analyses of ecological, cli-<lb/>
<pb n="483"/>
<pb n="483" type="orig"/>
matic, geological, topographical, hydrological, eco-<lb/>
nomic, natural, scenic, and historical features (fig. 15.8). Assigning categories of social value to these, he has been able to chart optimum development paths and preservation zones according to the carrying capacity of the land and its fitness for specific uses. Put as simply as possible, a <name type="pname">McHarg</name> plan, such as the ones he prepared for the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Metropolitan Area, the <name type="place">Baltimore</name> Region, the Potomac River Basin, and for relocating the highway planned through the <name type="place">Staten Island Greenbelt</name>, assigns levels of density and development and categories of land use based upon suitability. Flood and hurricane vulnerability and water conservation are paramount considerations. Overlay analysis shows invariably that valleys with their biologically and hydrologically important river basins and wetlands should be preserved, develop-<lb/>
ment on slopes should be minimized to allow ground-<lb/>
water to drain properly and recharge the subsurface aquifer, and uplands where settlement is least dam-<lb/>
aging allowed to become the zones of most intense occupation. Between <date when="1970">1970</date> and <date when="1974">1974</date>, <name type="pname">McHarg</name>'s firm, <name type="pname">Wallace McHarg Roberts</name> and <name type="pname">Todd</name>, applied this plan-<lb/>
ning methodology to the development of Wood-<lb/>

standing of landscape design as process rather than unchanging product. He calls this process "scoring," a musical metaphor implying his intention to create spatial frameworks that allow for change over time and within which others can play participatory riffs. His legacy includes, besides his landscape designs, books that elucidate his design approach, including <hi rend="italic">The R.S.V.P. Cycles: Creative Processes in the Human Envi-<lb/>

<p>Between <date when="1962">1962</date> and <date when="1965">1965</date>, <name type="pname">Halprin</name> was responsi-<lb/>
ble for making San <name type="place">Francisco</name>'s Ghiradelli Square, an early effort at urban revitalization, into a vibrant pub-<lb/>
lic space animated by fountains, outdoor lighting, and landscaping, where people come for alfresco eating, shopping, socializing, and participating in perform-<lb/>
ances, which are often impromptu. His "Take Part" design workshops elicit citizen collaboration in shap-<lb/>
ing a project's final program. Even as several other prominent landscape architects such as <name type="pname">Hideo Sasaki</name> and <name type="pname">Peter Walker</name> (b. <date when="1932">1932</date>) have adopted the corpo-<lb/>
rate-management style of successful large architec-<lb/>

<p>With a strong interest in making landscape architecture transcend the functional and social to attain a spiritual dimension, Halprin has studied Jun-<lb/>
gian psychology in search of symbols and archetypes that hold universal meaning. Echoing Olmsted's notion of the fundamental benefit of parks as an uplifting of the spirit through the senses, Halprin has said, "What we are after is a sense of poetry in the land-<lb/>
scape, a magnificent lift which will enrich the lives of the people who are moving about in the landscape."<ref target="#CH15-n25"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">25</hi></hi></ref> He has nourished his own spiritual roots by maintaining a strong connection over the years with

<p><name type="pname">Halprin</name>'s connection with <name type="pname">McHarg</name>'s approach to environmental planning is perhaps most evident in his "ecoscore" for Sea Ranch, a planned commu-<lb/>

tectural firm of Charles Moore, Donlyn Lyndon, William Turnbull, and Richard Whitaker (figs. 15.12, 15.13).

Unlike Seaside, where low picket fences manifest an ambience of yard-to-yard neighborliness, at Sea Ranch owners' rules specify that properties be kept unfenced. The clustered houses without visible property lines or landscaping appear to merge with their natural setting. This inten-<lb/>

<p>As an innovative effort in environmentally har-<lb/>
monious place making and an expression of the <date when="1960">1960</date>s idealism that motivated the careers of both <name type="pname">McHarg</name> and <name type="pname">Halprin</name>, Sea Ranch deserves a place in the his-<lb/>
tory of landscape design. Both of these landscape architects have seen city and country as a continuum, and their influence in furthering a new moral imper-<lb/>
ative by bringing ecological considerations to the fore has been influential within their profession.</p>
<p>As much of the aging industrial infrastructure of cities falls into disuse because of new transportation and manufacturing technologies, landscape architects have been engaged in the reclamation of <hi rend="italic">brownfields,</hi> former factory sites and decaying waterfronts. Notable among those who have attempted to poeticize the industrial past through landscape design is Richard Haag (b. <date when="1923">1923</date>), an early Postmodern con-<lb/>
textualist whose Gasworks Park (<date when="1970">1970</date>&#x2013;78) on the shores of Lake Union in Seattle, <name type="place">Washington</name>, and Bloedel Reserve, <name type="place">Bainbridge Island</name>, Puget Sound, <name type="place">Washington</name> (<date when="1985">1985</date>&#x2014;), demonstrate concern for envi-<lb/>
ronmental healing through bioremediation.</p>
<p>Although contemporary landscape architects have not entirely abandoned the principles of the Pic-<lb/>
turesque, Arts and Crafts, Neoclassical, and Mod-<lb/>
ernist design traditions that have constituted their training during the past century, and although they still rely on some of the principles of these design styles as well as upon McHargian environmentalism to inform their work, several are adopting an approach that seeks the same kind of creative free-<lb/>
dom granted to Conceptual artists. Thus, they look to their own imaginative resources as they manipu-<lb/>
late stones, earth, and water to produce land art, forms in and of the landscape. At the same time, Earthworks artists share some of the same concerns as environmentalists, and they work in a similar manner and at the same scale as landscape architects. As they, too, seek to manifest beauty within a brown-<lb/>
fields context, the distinction between art and land-<lb/>
scape design tends to dissolve.</p>

<p>Industrial technology has produced the machines that can manipulate landscapes with an ease previously undreamed of; without it Earthworks, or Land art, would probably not exist. There are certain ironies, both intended and not, in the creation of these mon-<lb/>
umental and often beautiful projects. Many evoke in scale and cosmological intent the primary earthworks of prehistoric peoples, yet they are not expressions of widely shared and deeply held cosmologically ori-<lb/>
ented religious belief as were the great earthworks created at <name type="place">Newark</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>, or <name type="place">Cahokia</name>, <name type="place">Illinois</name>, which we examined in Chapter One. Rather they are the heroic creations of artists who, often through the agency of bulldozers and other earthmoving equip-<lb/>
ment, have accomplished with relatively small work crews and within their own lifetimes landscape transformations on a scale rivaling that of these original earthworks, the building of which employed battal-<lb/>
ions of workers over a period of many decades or even centuries. Frequently placed by choice or neces-<lb/>
sity in remote and inaccessible locations, often the deserts of the American West, modern Earthworks exist primarily for the appreciation of tourists who are willing, usually by means of a four-wheel-drive vehicle, to experience them firsthand and for other followers of contemporary art who are content to view aerial photographs of them.</p>
<p>Indeed, the camera is their handmaiden, for rarely if ever are these sometimes ephemeral proj-<lb/>
ects undocumented. Still and moving images are as important to the artists as the Earthworks them-<lb/>
selves, and some artists such as Andy Goldsworthy (b. <date when="1956">1956</date>), whose delicate and poetic constructions are exceedingly transitory, have become photographers of professional stature in the service of their art (fig. 15.14). Aerial photography, which also allows us to comprehend better the configuration of such pre-<lb/>
historic earthworks as the Nazca lines in Peru (see fig. 1.35) or Serpent Mound in <name type="place">Ohio</name> (see fig. 1.37), is similarly important in making many modern Earth-<lb/>
works legible.</p>

</figure>
<p>The space they occupy makes a territorial claim to the sublime that substitutes for the inherent divin-<lb/>
ity that prehistoric and ancient societies ascribed to their sacred places. Unlike the acts of cosmological centering performed by these early people, however, the creators of contemporary Earthworks must locate them through a necessarily mundane process involving negotiation of property leases or the pur-<lb/>
chase of real estate. In the case of some Earthworks artists, especially Christo (b. <date when="1935">1935</date>), who for this rea-<lb/>
son perhaps chooses important and conspicuous urban areas for some of his projects, the process of obtaining permits is as important as the realization of the art itself.</p>
<p>Being explicitly identified with specific artists, contemporary Earthworks have an importance within the context of our celebrity-conscious culture more often linked to the name of the artist than to the concepts they are intended to manifest. This is
<pb n="488"/>
<pb n="488" type="orig"/>
unfortunate because many were intended as a critique of art-world values as well as of Industrial Age envi-<lb/>
ronmental degradation. Although Earthworks have a materiality that transcends a strict definition of Con-<lb/>
ceptual art, the Earthworks movement is neverthe-<lb/>
less contemporary with, and part of, the Conceptual art movement. Both Land art and Conceptural art are latter-day links in early-twentieth-century Mod-<lb/>
ernism's break with tradition and expansion of the definition of what is art. Both are part of the same late <date when="1960">1960</date>s gestalt of protest against the established norms for viewing and thinking about art. Both eschew style in favor of idea and form.</p>

<p>Smithson was in a sense an environmentalist, a man acutely aware of the degradation of natural land-<lb/>

planetary, rather than human, dialectics. He brought to his art the perspective of earth science gained from frequent trips as a child to the American Museum of Natural History and on car trips with his family to the American West. From his boyhood interest in natu-<lb/>

long (5.9-meter-long) industrial concrete pipes are positioned in alignment with the rising and setting of the sun at the time of the summer and winter sol-<lb/>
stices. Perforations in the pipes admit light in patterns that evoke various star constellations. More attuned to evoking ancient cosmological expressions in the landscape than modern physics, Holt's subsequent Earthworks include <hi rend="italic">30 Below</hi> (<date when="1980">1980</date>) for the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, <name type="place">New York</name>; <hi rend="italic">Star Crossed</hi> (<date when="1980">1980</date>) at Miami University, <name type="place">Oxford</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>; and <hi rend="italic">Dark Star Park</hi> (<date when="1984">1984</date>) in <name type="place">Arlington</name>, <name type="place">Virginia</name>.

land</name>, consists of seven horizontal concrete tunnels, four of which are aligned on an east-west axis, while three are oriented with Polaris, the North Star (figs. 15.19, 15.20). The tunnels protrude from a 630-foot-<lb/>
long (192-meter-long) snakelike mound ending in a roughly circular mound that is approximately 230 feet (70 meters) in diameter and 26 feet (7.9 meters) high.</p>
<p>Like ancient cosmological landscapes, <hi rend="italic">Up and Under</hi> has an "axis mundi" in the form of a large ver-<lb/>
tical tunnel placed at the crossing of four tunnels beneath the round mound. It brings a circle of sky with clouds, stars, and sometimes the moon into the perception of the viewer within the tunnel. Rein-<lb/>
forcing the cosmological idea of centering space, Holt took samples of soil from villages all over <name type="place">Finland</name> and buried this mixture beneath the vertical tunnel. In addition, she placed three circular sky-reflecting pools, which are fed by an ancient spring, in the quarry floor adjacent to the mounds, whose slopes are covered with grass. The pools, which vary in diameter from 22 feet (6.7 meters) to 30 feet (9.1 meters) to 40 feet (12.2 meters), also mirror the Earthwork. It is meant,

neath the earth, inside the tunnels. It can also be expe-<lb/>
rienced by following the path at the top of the winding mound or by moving around the forms on the quarry floor. According to Holt, "Each changing visual experience leads to a questioning of perception itself&#x2014;near and far, whole and detail, reflection and reality, aerial and ground."<ref target="#CH15-n30"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">30</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Like the creators of Earthworks, golf-course designers are concerned with sculpting the land, although not to express conceptual meaning but
<pb n="493"/>
<pb n="493" type="orig"/>
rather for strategic purposes that are intrinsic to the game. Yet because of the sport's venerable history, its impact on land and water resources, and its impor-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Landscape as Sport: The Golf Course</hi></head>
<p>Course architecture is such a basic element of golf that the characteristics of each course account for the degree of challenge it presents to players.<ref target="#CH15-n34"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">34</hi></hi></ref>In a great global family tree of golf courses all the branches can be traced to <name type="place">Scotland</name> where the game grew out of the landscape, the sandy alluvial terrain called links. Natural links are found in estuarine areas where rivers deposit sediment on their way to the sea. Golf origi-<lb/>
nated as a game along the estuaries of the rivers <name type="pname">Eden</name>, <name type="pname">Tay</name>, and <name type="pname">Forth</name>. The first golf course, <name type="pname">St. Andrews</name>, dat-<lb/>
ing from the early fifteenth century was in its earliest form completely natural, a treeless stretch of wind-<lb/>
swept, rolling dunes with soil pockets supporting native bent grasses and some fescue.</p>
<p>The original game involved batting a "featherie," a small leather-bound, feather-stuffed ball, along a route improvised from the grass-covered links, avoiding the natural hazards of the gorse-encrusted dunes and eroded sandy hollows. Tees, clearly defined fairways, and well-manicured putting greens were unknown. Players simply wandered across this hillocky, treeless landscape, aiming their shots at whatever small holes served as cups. Although a series of such holes became institutionalized through repeated play, the number of cups on different Scottish links varied.</p>
<p>In the mid-eighteenth century, golfers' clubs were formed to organize the play. The Society of St. Andrews Golfers instituted turf maintenance for the putting areas, or greens and, in <date when="1764">1764</date>, set eighteen as the official circuit of holes that was later followed else-<lb/>
where. Golf-course architecture had its inception as the members of St. Andrews started to manipulate their natural golfing terrain by cutting double cups into enlarged greens&#x2014;one for matches heading "out," the other for those heading "in," widening the grassy playing strip by substituting turf for heather, and adding artificial hazards. "Penal" design is represented by the Old Course as it originally existed, where it was necessary to clear many natural hazards; the alterna-<lb/>
tive is "strategic" design, which allows the player the option of taking a slightly longer but safer route at the cost of additional strokes. From these basic principles, golf course architecture evolved.</p>
<p>Adopted in <name type="place">England</name> and after <date when="1779">1779</date> in <name type="place">America</name>, golf was played on rudimentary courses often lack-<lb/>
ing the characteristics of linkslands terrain. But the popularity of the game grew, particularly when in <date when="1848">1848</date> the low-cost, durable ball made from the natu-<lb/>
ral latex of the tropical gutta-percha plant was invented. This also made possible the use of revolu-<lb/>
tionary iron-headed golf clubs. As the demand for new courses grew with the gradual spread of the game, the first course designers were Scots and then Englishmen with professional qualifications derived from greenskeeping, not landscape design. They worked almost entirely on the ground, not from drawn plans, paying attention to the practicalities of the game rather than to any picturesque qualities inherent in the landscape. They did little to alter their sites, incorporating existing turf and other features or simply modifying courses, making them safer for the growing population of golfers or extending the length of holes to take into account the longer flight of the new gutta-percha balls.</p>
<p>In the second half of the nineteenth century, innovations in the routing of the course introduced variability in wind direction as a challenge for players. New machinery for mowing and new means of cut-<lb/>
-<lb/>
ting and lining holes with metal cups improved the quality of the greens. Discovery through trial and error proved that the heathlands southwest of <name type="place">London</name> were ideal inland golfing country when cleared of certain vegetation.</p>
<p>By <date when="1900">1900</date>, nearly a thousand courses had been built in the United States. With their distant views across rolling meadowlike greenswards fringed with trees, many of these golf courses offer scenery simi-<lb/>
lar to that found in "Capability" Brown's Grecian Val-<lb/>
ley at Stowe or Olmsted and Vaux's Long Meadow in Prospect Park (see Chapters Seven and Nine). But this is simply coincidence, because on golf courses the designer's primary consideration is not the scenery but rather the lie&#x2014;the position of the golf ball as it ceases rolling and comes to a stop. Bodies of water, however scenic, are intended as hazards for the player, not aesthetic features. Near the putting greens, fair-<lb/>
ways are punctuated with bunkers, shallow sand-filled depressions, also intended as strategically positioned hazards. To provide a final challenge as the player reaches the hole, designers have greens graded with almost imperceptibly undulating surfaces.</p>
<p>The <date when="1920">1920</date>s was a golden era for golf course con-<lb/>
struction in the United States, with an average of six hundred constructed each year between <date when="1923">1923</date> and <date when="1929">1929</date>, boosting the national total from 1,903 to 5,648. Many of these were laid out by local greenskeepers, who were often emigrants from Great Britain, and amateur golfers whose primary intent was to shape the landscape to suit the objectives of the game. Given an extraordinary site on <name type="place">California</name>'s Monterey Penin-<lb/>
sula, two regional tournament champions, <name type="pname">John Francis Neville</name> (<date when="1895">1895</date>&#x2013;<date when="1978">1978</date>) and <name type="pname">Douglas S. Grant</name>

<p>Equally endowed, Cypress Point, adjacent to Pebble Beach, was laid out ten years later by Alister Mackensie (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1934">1934</date>), a British physician turned golf-course designer. Mackensie, who built courses in <name type="place">England</name>, <name type="place">Scotland</name>, <name type="place">Ireland</name>, <name type="place">Canada</name>, <name type="place">Australia</name>, <name type="place">New Zealand</name>, and <name type="place">South America</name> as well as the United States, is considered one of the most eminent course designers in golf history, a reputation bolstered by his publication in <date when="1920">1920</date> of <hi rend="italic">Golf Architecture,</hi> codifying thir-<lb/>
teen key principles guiding course layout. These included&#x2014;in addition to those directed at enhancing the strategic interest of the game, the comfort and convenience of players, and the year-round playabil-<lb/>
ity of the course&#x2014;one that advised blending the course's artificial and natural features so that the two appeared indistinguishable.</p>
<p>By the mid-<date when="1930">1930</date>s, following the worst years of the Great Depression, course construction began to accelerate in the United States with the creation of the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) to provide work for the unemployed. Municipal golf courses began to appear in cities across the country. The WPA crews moved earth and sculpted terrain using wheelbarrows and hand tools rather than heavy machinery, but after World War II when private golf course construction again boomed and massive unemployment was no longer a problem, modern earthmoving equipment was used. This greatly abbreviated the time it took to build a golf course. In addition, with petroleum no longer scarce, fuel for mowing machinery became readily available, which also stimulated course construction.</p>
<p>During this period <name type="pname">Robert Trent Jones</name> (b. <date when="1906">1906</date>) rose to preeminence as <name type="pname">America</name>'s foremost golf-<lb/>
course architect, and by <date when="1990">1990</date> his firm's portfolio contained 450 courses in forty-two states. Trent blended the "penal" and "strategic" types of design with the creation of a style he called "heroic." His "heroic" courses eschewed the elaborate bunkering of penal-<lb/>
type design, substituting a single, formidable, diago-<lb/>
nally placed hazard such as a pond that the golfer had to clear with a long drive of more than 500 feet (152.4 meters). At the same time, the golfer was allowed to choose an alternative, less risky route to the green. Trent's particular gift as a designer lay in employing penal, strategic, and heroic design techniques accord-<lb/>
ing to the nature of play a course was expected to receive, taking into account whether it was munici-<lb/>
pal operation for the general public, a resort for pay-<lb/>
ing guests, a country club for members, a private layout for an owner and friends, or a tournament venue for professional golfers.</p>
<p>In the <date when="1960">1960</date>s, professional golfers were becoming celebrities, thanks especially to televised sports matches. The popularity of golf, particularly among the growing number of active retired people, was responsible for a new land-planning phenomenon: the residential community built around a golf course. However, by the mid-<date when="1970">1970</date>s, the escalating cost of course construction, the energy crisis, tight money, new environmental regulations in the United States, and land-use restrictions in <name type="place">Japan</name> curtailed the rate of
<pb n="495"/>
<pb n="495" type="orig"/>
golf-course building. Then, during the prosperous <date when="1980">1980</date>s, the pace of course construction revived. <name type="pname">George Fazio</name> (<date when="1912">1912</date>&#x2013;<date when="1986">1986</date>), working with his nephews, <name type="pname">Thomas Joseph Fazio</name> (b. <date when="1945">1945</date>) and <name type="pname">Vincent James Fazio</name> (b. <date when="1942">1942</date>) built and revised courses, including sev-<lb/>
eral for clubs hosting major tournaments. The view from Hole 18, known as Super Dune, on the Emer-<lb/>
ald Dunes Golf Course in West Palm Beach, <name type="place">Florida</name>, shows how, in <date when="1990">1990</date>, Tom Fazio sculpted artificial water bodies, sweeping fairways, and contoured greens to create a scenic panorama out of former scrub land covered with palmetto thickets (fig. 15.24).</p>
<p>In <date when="1974">1974</date>, eminent professional golfer Jack Nick-<lb/>
laus (b. <date when="1940">1940</date>) organized his own firm. In <name type="place">Scottsdale</name>, <name type="place">Arizona</name>, his Desert Highlands <name type="pname">Golf Club</name> (<date when="1984">1984</date>) demonstrated how a grass-demanding sport could be successfully integrated into a naturally arid landscape. Restricted in the amount of irrigation he could use, Nicklaus created wide swaths of playable sand between fairly narrow turfy fairways and the pebbles and coarse rock of the surrounding desert. Never-<lb/>
theless, Nicklaus, who seeks a deluxe finish to his courses, insists upon velvety bent grass for all his greens no matter the climate. In addition, he typically builds cascades for his water hazards, installs elabo-<lb/>
rate irrigation systems, and specifies the use of state-<lb/>
of-the-art mowing equipment.</p>
<p>Perhaps Thorstein Veblen's theory of conspic-<lb/>
uous consumption, or nonproductive leisure as a means of displaying wealth, discussed in Chapter Twelve, is nowhere more manifest than in the game of golf, especially if this assessment takes into account the difficult issue of water rights in dry climates. In spite of conservationists' protests, the popularity of the game is such that it is politically difficult to stem the tide of course construction, even in arid com-<lb/>
munities where water reservoirs run dangerously low and capacity cannot be expanded. The fact that golf-<lb/>
ing has become almost an obligatory ritual among corporate businesspeople who routinely meet clients on the links exacerbates this difficult and continuing ecological and societal problem.</p>
<p>Although contemporary enthusiasm for golf may be capricious, the story we have briefly traced of its evolution from the seaside links of <name type="place">Scotland</name> to the inland desert around <name type="place">Scottsdale</name>, from a sport whose objectives and rules were shaped by landscape to one that employs a high degree of artifice and mecha-<lb/>
nization in manipulating the landscape to create new challenges for players, is an entirely pragmatic one. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the landscape that is highly theoretical in its design intent, one that takes shape not from the land or the requirements of sport or other user demands. Such a landscape is Parc de la Villette in <name type="place">Paris</name>.</p>

<p>Tschumi's self-imposed challenge was to give spatial expression to a philosophical idea that rejects unitary meaning in favor of spontaneous multiple occurrences, or "event-texts" in the language of deconstructivism. His method was to create a fluid, nonspecific, uncentered, unconfined space &#x2014; a the-<lb/>
oretically boundaryless receptacle devoid of any rep-<lb/>
resentational associations, a blank textbook in which anyone can inscribe whatever meaning they choose.</p>
<p>Although in Tschumi's theoretical view it has no boundaries, Parc de la Villette is anchored by a sci-<lb/>
ence museum on its southwest end and by a music conservatory and performance hall on its northeast perimeter. These large cultural institutions, also the result of design competitions, were built at approxi-<lb/>
mately the same time as the park. In addition, the industrial structures that once served as slaughter-<lb/>
houses have been reused as event centers. The park in between and surrounding these buildings is an open grassy plain designed as an imaginary grid punc-<lb/>
tuated by <hi rend="italic">folies,</hi> a series of bright red, cubelike build-<lb/>
ings, which appear as large abstract geometric sculptures set at regular intervals upon the greens-<lb/>
ward. Tschumi intended his green platform with red <hi rend="italic">folies</hi> placed at grid intersections as "a surface of mul-<lb/>
tireferential anchoring points for things or people which leads to a partial coherence."<ref target="#CH15-n37"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">37</hi></hi></ref>Though with-<lb/>
out specified uses at the time of construction, these now function like structures in conventional parks; some are snack bars, one is a children's play structure, another a first-aid station, and so forth. A curvilinear, below-grade Bamboo Garden designed by Alexandre Chemetoff (b. <date when="1950">1950</date>) provides a counterpoint to the strict geometry of Tschumi's theoretically endless spa-<lb/>
tial grid. At grade, a similarly serpentine path also plays against the regularity of the overall plan.</p>
<p>This highly intellectualized approach to land-<lb/>
scape creation is the province of design competitions and the product of an avant-garde cultural establish-<lb/>
ment. The French have historically been especially hospitable to innovation and cerebral forms of artis-<lb/>
tic expression. However, other new Parisian essays in landscape creation, notably the new parks of Bercy and Andr&#x00E9; Citro&#x00EB;n, do not pursue the deconstruc-<lb/>
tivist course charted at Parc de la Villette. These other new parks project the kind of meaning and symbolic structure of older gardens where representation&#x2014; the <hi rend="italic">re-presentation</hi> of ideas, as opposed to the presen-<lb/>

<p>Poet and visual artist <name type="pname">Ian Hamilton Finlay</name> (b. <date when="1925">1925</date>) established his reputation in the <date when="1960">1960</date>s as a pioneer of concrete poetry, the arrangement of individual words on a page, often accompanied by pictorial images, in ways that gives them psychological resonance and heightened meaning. His garden near <name type="place">Lanark</name>, <name type="place">Scot-<lb/>
land</name>, which he calls Little <name type="place">Sparta</name>, with its textual ele-<lb/>
ments&#x2014;graphically beautiful incised stones and wood&#x2014;explores the gap between language and sign, indulging a subtle interplay of word and form, within the context of landscape (figs. 15.29,15.30). As a gar-<lb/>
den of association, Little <name type="place">Sparta</name> is reminiscent of such eighteenth-century creations as <name type="pname">William Shenstone</name>'s Leasowes or <name type="pname">Henry Hoare</name>'s Stourhead, which also abound in evocations of antiquity.<ref target="#CH15-n38"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">38</hi></hi></ref>As we saw in Chapter Seven, the Leasowes was a <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e,</hi> and Stourhead, with its themes from the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> is a highly poetic landscape manifesting Virgil's epic narration of the founding of <name type="place">Rome</name>. Like these eighteenth-<lb/>
century predecessors, Little <name type="place">Sparta</name> consciously recalls the Arcadian paintings of the seventeenth-century artist <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name> and the nostalgic echoes of a Golden Age found in Virgil's <hi rend="italic">Eclogues,</hi> the series of pastoral poems composed by the Latin poet between 42 and 37 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> Situated in the rolling Pentland Hills of southern <name type="place">Scotland</name> where sheep graze, the garden effectively implies these earlier depictions of a bucolic landscape studded with a few antique ruins. In such Claudian or Virgilian scenes human action occurs within the rhythms of a timeless agrarian round as shepherds and flocks move in sunlit meadows and rest beside shady groves and softly gliding streams. At Lit-<lb/>
tle <name type="place">Sparta</name>, the themes of water and land, waves and hills, boats and huts predominate, although the gar-<lb/>
den also contains references to the French Revolution and warfare, especially World War II, and symboli-<lb/>
cally hints at the shadow of destructive nuclear power under which we live today. With such memorials to our losses of innocence as the fallen "Arcadia" column

and "Nuclear Sail," a smoothly rounded, silkily fin-<lb/>
ished, matte gray "gravestone," Little <name type="place">Sparta</name>'s improb-<lb/>
able and ironic dialogue with the tranquil Scottish borderland may perhaps be best characterized as an elegant and elegiac meditation on postindustrial as well as postpastoral civilization.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Maya Ying Lin</name> (b. <date when="1959">1959</date>) is an artist who works in the conceptual zone between landscape design and sculpture, and, like Finlay, she understands the com-<lb/>
bined power of words and visual imagery. Often clas-<lb/>
sified with Earthworks artists, she is less concerned with creating large-scale works of cosmological ref-<lb/>
erence in remote locations than with imaging a meta-<lb/>
physical poetry in environments that are readily accessible and where her art gains significance from the opportunities presented by the site. For these rea-<lb/>
sons, Lin's work is not abstractly philosophical. Instead, it is informed by psychology and phenome-<lb/>
nology. Unlike the awesome and somewhat intimi-<lb/>
dating works of some artists, Lin's con- structions are intimate and inviting, while serving an essentially poetic purpose. Water and stone and images of time and movement are important elements in her art, and she employs these in sensory as well as symbolical ways. Psychology is evident in her use of other forms of sensory stimulation besides the visual: her work is tactile and aural, encouraging one to touch, be still, and listen. She is more concerned with investing places with universal human significance than with creating spaces like Parc de la Villette that are intended to serve as abstract architectural demonstrations of philosophical theory.</p>
<p>Lin sprang to prominence in <date when="1981">1981</date> as a Yale undergraduate when she won the design competi-<lb/>
tion for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (fig. 15.31). A requirement of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, sponsors of the competition, was that the memorial contain the names of the more than 57,000 servicemen who died or are missing in action in that tragic conflict. Conceived as two retaining walls of black polished granite holding a grassy bank at an angle of 132 degrees, this sober, tactile, meditation upon death and war leads the visitor along an inclined path past the inscribed necrology that begins and ends at the apex of the triangular incision in the earth.</p>
<p>Begun as a studio project in an architecture class, Lin's competition entry drew inspiration indirectly from a memorial that was formally quite different: Sir Edwin Lutyens's monument to the missing soldiers of the World War I Battle of the Somme in Thiepval, <name type="place">France</name>, an immense archway upon which 100,000 names are inscribed. "To walk past those names and realize those lost lives&#x2014;the effect of that is the strength of the design," Lin has written. Her approach was similarly "apolitical, harmonious with the site, and conciliatory" Lin wished to produce a monument
<pb n="499"/>
<pb n="499" type="orig"/>
that was lacking in histrionic content but capable of serving as a necessary cathartic vehicle for mourning the tragedy of the war, a means for veterans and other visitors to come to terms with the soldiers' deaths. About the design, she says, "I imagined taking a knife and cutting into the earth, opening it up, an initial vio-<lb/>
lence and pain that in time would heal. The grass would grow back, but the initial cut would remain a pure flat surface in the earth with a polished, mirrored surface, much like the surface on a geode when you cut it and polish the edge. The need for the names to be on the memorial would become the memorial; there was no need to embellish the design further. The people and their names would allow everyone to respond and remember. ... I always wanted the names to be chronological, to make it so that those who served and returned from the war could find their place in the memorial."<ref target="#CH15-n39"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">39</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>One side of the Vietnam Memorial's wide sunken V points to the <name type="place">Washington</name> Monument, which is reflected in the somber granite's mirror fin-<lb/>
ish; the other is directed toward the Lincoln Memor-<lb/>
ial. The openness, darkness, and below-grade horizontality of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial sub-<lb/>
tly oppose the self-containment, whiteness, and ver-<lb/>
ticality of those structures. "By linking these two strong symbols for the country, I wanted to create a unity between the nation's past and present," says Lin. The mirror finish also reflects the visitors' images and the surrounding park, "creating two worlds, one we are a part of and one we cannot enter."<ref target="#CH15-n40"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">40</hi></hi></ref> The still-<lb/>
ness and emotion are palpable as visitors descend to experience the wide V's sober embrace, some of their fingers tracing over the letters of the names. Few overtly heroic monuments command this degree of respectful attention. Fresh flowers, recently written notes, and other newly deposited tokens of respect and love bespeak the continuing bond between the living and the dead.</p>

<p>In enjoining artists "to portray a more interest-<lb/>

ence. Along with Jencks, Lin is interested in giving landscape expression to the new concepts of the uni-<lb/>
verse that are emerging through advanced science and technology. By coincidence, she was born and grew up in <name type="pname">Athens</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>, near the Hopewell Mounds, and while these ancient relics probably hold the same fascination for her as for archaeologists and other cos-<lb/>
mologically oriented artists of Earthworks, her pri-<lb/>
mary objective is to discern and express what we are here suggesting as "fourth nature," a state that inte-<lb/>
grates the three preexisting categories of nature&#x2014; wilderness, cultivated land, and the garden&#x2014;with science and technology. This dimension of her work
<pb n="500"/>

derives inspiration from the optical and photographic instruments&#x2014;microscopes, telescopes, and satellite cameras&#x2014;that make us perceive the world and uni-<lb/>

<p>To create <hi rend="italic">The Wave Field</hi> (<date when="1995">1995</date>), a 100-foot-<lb/>
square (30.5-meter-square) earth and grass memorial commissioned for the François-Xavier Bagnoud Aero-<lb/>
space Engineering Building at the University of Michi-<lb/>
gan in Ann Arbor, Lin studied the fluid dynamics associated with the physics of flight (fig. 15.32). The image that gave substance to the fluidity, indetermi-<lb/>
nacy, and unending repetitiousness of the movement of air currents essential to flight was for her a photo-<lb/>
graph of ocean waves in a turbulent sea. Here she evokes both her notion of the indeterminate charac-<lb/>
ter of the endless advancing and receding ocean and the oceanic appearance of the waving prairie that was once the American Midwest. Each of the earthen waves, which vary slightly in breadth and height, is a cozy shell in which students come to sit and read. As Michael Brenson explains:
<q>In <hi rend="italic">The Wave Field,</hi> indeterminacy becomes place. Lin grounds it, makes it available to actual peo-<lb/>
ple. She also gives it a moral purpose, even an urgency, that would be inconceivable in many hymns to indeterminacy. <hi rend="italic">The Wave Field</hi> makes a case for art's ability to encourage people to gather in an environ-<lb/>
ment where they will be comfortable with one another and able to trust what they have not yet recognized and what they cannot measure or control; an environment in which children feel safe and inspired by the pleasure that can come from experiencing the world in terms of discovery, play, intercon-<lb/>
nectedness, and flow.<ref target="#CH15-n42"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">42</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>Place as indeterminacy and experience as dis-<lb/>
covery, play, interconnectedness, and flow are con-<lb/>
cepts of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Earthworks and other forms of Conceptual art bear witness to the entropic character of contemporary civilization, engage our imaginations in new cosmo-<lb/>
logical perspectives on the meaning of time and space, and provide metaphorical expression for our otherwise inexpressible sorrows or joys. At the same time, our everyday lives proceed in diurnal time and real space. Our understanding of contemporary place must therefore accommodate the accelerated change, motion, and communication that characterizes the new Postindustrial Age. We must seek to compre-<lb/>
hend a geography that is both temporal and spatial, one of flows, instantaneousness, and virtuality. Place is, in the last analysis, experiential, as much a state of mind as an earthly reality. It is, according to contem-<lb/>
porary thought, grounded within us, within our phys-<lb/>
ical bodies as well as within our psyches. This is true whether we are stationary&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in place</hi>&#x2014;or traveling. It is important to understand that movement itself is part of the experience of place and that we are all in a sense weavers of landscape. It is with this notion of place-making as weaving and the reading of the world as a loom of landscape, a cultural geography, that we will conclude.</p>

</figure>
<p>The cultural background shaping contemporary attitudes toward landscape and place can be discerned in philosophy, which toward the end of the nineteenth century found its domain in alliance with psychology. During this period, confidence in West-<lb/>
ern society's progressive ideology began to erode as science and philosophy split ever further apart, and the restless search for truth became a matter of continually shifting premises. As revolutionary scientific discoveries overthrew former religious belief about the creation of the universe, they substituted no reasonable new cos-<lb/>
mology, only the exhilarating yet sometimes disquieting intellec-<lb/>
tual voyage into the unknown that continues still.</p>
<p>The implications of evolutionary biology in <hi rend="italic">The Origin of Species,</hi> which <name type="pname">Charles Darwin</name> (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) published in <date when="1859">1859</date>, made it clear that humankind could no longer be viewed as separate from the rest of the animal kingdom. Furthermore, the field of scien-<lb/>
tific geology developed by Sir Charles Lyell (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875">1875</date>), from whose fossil record Darwin drew many of his conclusions, under-<lb/>
mined completely the notion that Earth's topography&#x2014;the con-<lb/>
text and medium of landscape design&#x2014;could have been modeled by mythological gods or a Divine Craftsman, rather than by the natural forces of crustal upthrust and erosion by wind and water.</p>
<p>At the same time that geologists learned that the shape of Earth's surface is the product of many eons of flux, physicists unset-<lb/>
tled established verities regarding the stability and timelessness of the universe. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the for-<lb/>
mulation of the second law of thermodynamics, which foretells the disintegration of the universe as it moves toward a state of entropy, undermined the Enlightenment's confident, rational Carte-<lb/>
sian-Newtonian cosmology. <name type="pname">Albert Einstein</name> (<date when="1879">1879</date>&#x2013;<date when="1955">1955</date>) further eroded the principles of Enlightenment science with the theory of relativity, and thus the independent and absolute nature of space and time. Quantum mechanics further unseated accepted truths.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment concept of a heliocentric universe was relegated to the dustbin of science. In recent years, the theory of a Big Bang has gained general acceptance as the generative power behind a multigalactic universe composed of many hundreds of billions of solar masses. Telescopic space probes of heretofore unimaginable depth are revealing ever more remote galaxies. Today universal space is understood to be curved, even malleable, rather than as extending in a straight plane as Ren&#x00E9; Descartes had logi-<lb/>
cally supposed in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Seen thus in the light of biology, geology, and physics, belief in a stable, unchanging, God-created world and belief in the human being's extraordinary, semidivine status within it were severely shaken. Religion thus proved capable of providing personal con-<lb/>
viction and moral guidance only for the individual rather than serv-<lb/>
ing as a metaphysical structure of belief for society at large. Friedrich Nietzsche (<date when="1844">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) laid down the premise for exis-<lb/>
tentialism with his declaration of "the death of God." Nietzsche believed that, liberated from the concept of an objective reality based upon rationality, humans could realize their potential through the heroic enterprise of self-invention&#x2014;the creation of an indi-<lb/>
vidual Truth. In Nietzsche's supremely Romantic vision of the unshackled self, art acquired the status formerly accorded religion, and the poet assumed the seat of the philosopher, whose function was now generally confined to the area of linguistics, logical posi-<lb/>
tivism, and other noncosmological subjects.</p>
<p>Psychology began to preempt the role of philosophy in informing human thought and providing cultural context. Sigmund Freud (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1939">1939</date>) analyzed the human psyche by interpreting the experiences of childhood and the symbolical messages divulged in dreams. He posited that the unconscious mind and powerful bio-<lb/>
<pb n="503"/>
<pb n="503" type="orig"/>
logical instincts are the operative forces beneath civilization's veneer of rationality and ethical religion, accounting for its darker, chthonic impulses. To Freud's psychology Carl Jung (<date when="1875">1875</date>&#x2013;<date when="1961">1961</date>) added his concept of the collective unconscious grounded in, and structured by, archetypal principles. Jung's theories provide insight into the universality of psychological experience and the persistence of myth as a cultural phenomenon and metaphorical instrument for shap-<lb/>
ing intellectual perception and making art.</p>
<p>The weakening of collective religious belief bolstered by Niet-<lb/>
zsche's vision of the autonomous creative self and by psychology's focus on the interior lives of persons promoted individualism belief in the primacy of the individual and the rights of individuals within the larger framework of society. To some extent, statism belief in the supremacy of the state as the provider of a value sys-<lb/>
tem and social and economic structures capable of sustaining citizens both spiritually and physically&#x2014;attempted to fill the vac-<lb/>
uum left by religion's diminishing role in people's lives. But, as Niet-<lb/>
zsche intuited, the liberating notion of humanity's essential freedom and ability to rationally fashion a society of its own choosing has a dark side. People during an increasingly troubled and complex twen-<lb/>
tieth century came to understand this as divisiveness, enmity, racism, and revolt flourished along with our propensity for exploita-<lb/>
tion and cruelty. Unpersuaded by the rhetoric of evil demagogues or inept political leaders of the state's supremacy and viability as a substitute for God, many thinking people found themselves in a condition of existential despair. Yet if humankind is its own ulti-<lb/>
mate resource, then philosophy must necessarily focus upon the individual as an instrument of action as well as cognition.</p>
<p>Phenomenology and existentialism offered new philosophi-<lb/>
cal perspectives in this regard. The German philosopher Edmund Husserl (<date when="1859">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1938">1938</date>) sought to overcome the dualism inherent in Enlightenment philosophy following Descartes's separation of the field of inquiry into an objective material universe and a subjective cognitive self. Husserl gave primacy to the experience of everyday life, <hi rend="italic">Lebenswelt,</hi> or "life-world" as the basis of reality Phenomenol-<lb/>
ogy, the investigation of the data of consciousness&#x2014;moods, val-<lb/>
ues, desires&#x2014;and the things of the material world, including mathematics and the concept of space, constituted the philosoph-<lb/>
ical basis for reforming spiritual life. Within this framework, psy-<lb/>
chology was more than a social science; it validated intuition and subjective awareness as means for understanding the world.</p>
<p>With the publication of <hi rend="italic">Being and Time</hi> (<date when="1927">1927</date>), <name type="pname">Martin Hei-<lb/>
degger</name> (<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x2013;<date when="1976">1976</date>), Husserl's successor as professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg, extended Husserl's phenomenologi-<lb/>
cal investigations and attempt to rescue humanity's understanding of itself from the confines of rational science. Implicit in the philo-<lb/>
sophical concept he called <hi rend="italic">Dasein</hi>&#x2014;meaning "attunement," or "being <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> inhabiting and dwelling in the world"&#x2014; is the cher-<lb/>
ishing of place as the intimate infrastructure of everyday experi-<lb/>
ence. As the urban historian <name type="pname">Sam Bass Warner</name>, Jr., reminds us, Heidegger traced the verb to <hi rend="italic">dwell,</hi> which is fundamental to his con-<lb/>
cept of <hi rend="italic">Dasein</hi> to its original meaning: to build <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to cultivate land.<ref target="#CH16-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In his major work, <hi rend="italic">Ph&#x00E9;nom&#x00E9;nologie de la perception</hi> (Phenome-<lb/>
nology of Perception, <date when="1945">1945</date>), the French philosopher Maurice Mer-<lb/>
leau-Ponty (<date when="1908">1908</date>&#x2013;<date when="1961">1961</date>) also countered the existential angst and the nihilism fostered by the spiritual crisis of modern life by focusing upon "sense experience." For Merleau-Ponty, "Sense experience is that vital communication with the world which makes it present as a familiar setting of our life."<ref target="#CH16-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> The body anchors the individual in the world, connecting consciousness with the empirical and giv-<lb/>
ing coherent structure to perception and behavior. In this light, we are not passive subjects registering by means of cognition the spec-<lb/>
tacle of the world but agents of its transformation, projecting sig-<lb/>
nificance upon both our personal and collective histories through real and symbolic actions, thereby giving life form.</p>
<p>In relation to our subject, landscape, Merleau-Ponty's dis-<lb/>
course on the phenomenological aspect of space is instructive. He maintains that our need to feel stable, <hi rend="italic">in place,</hi> not vertiginously adrift but anchored <hi rend="italic">somewhere,</hi> proceeds from our bodily constitu-<lb/>
tion, our innate sensation of up and down, which is our primary apprehension of space and of being in the world. The affirmation of this basic truth and Merleau-Ponty's poetic regard for personal experience puts him in league with another French philosopher, Gaston Bachelard (<date when="1884">1884</date>&#x2013;<date when="1962">1962</date>). Bachelard used the combined approach of psychology and phenomenology to articulate in <hi rend="italic">The Poetics of Space</hi> (<date when="1957">1957</date>) a concept of "topoanalysis" in which poetic reverie encourages the individual to spiritually reinhabit the inti-<lb/>
mate spaces of memory where he finds images "which are all light and shimmer," proving that "houses that were lost forever continue to live on in us."<ref target="#CH16-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>According to Bachelard, through daydreams time is enfolded into psychic spatiality, as intimate places, particularly the places of childhood, abide in memory and dreams.</p>
<p>Bachelard's philosophical musing upon the poetics of place constitute an examination of "the quite simple images of <hi rend="italic">felicitous space."</hi><ref target="#CH16-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref>His topophilia, or fond remembrance of place, however, has its counterpart. Instead of examining space, as did <name type="pname">Bachelard</name>, in terms of imaginative poetics and phenomenology resonant with Jungian archetypes and individual psychology, <name type="pname">Michel Foucault</name> (<date when="1926">1926</date>&#x2013;<date when="1984">1984</date>) studied it as a historical, non-absolute, impermanent phenomenon, with widely differing interpretations from era to era and from culture to culture. Foucault posited a "heterotopology" of "countersites" that challenges Bachelard's order of intimate psy-<lb/>
chical place with an analysis of such politicized, historicized spaces as prisons, cemeteries, and parks.</p>
<p>In addition, in <hi rend="italic">Les Mots et les choses</hi> (<date when="1966">1966</date>: translated into Eng-<lb/>
lish as <hi rend="italic">The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences,</hi> <date when="1970">1970</date>) Foucault provides an analysis of the function of representa-<lb/>
tion, which, as landscape historian John Dixon Hunt extrapolates, can be usefully applied to a new and needed historiography of the garden. That account would suppress recitation of a narrative of styles in favor of an analysis (such as has been attempted in this book) of landscape as a combination of nature and art manifesting historically relevant cultural values.<ref target="#CH16-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref> With these intellectual prem-<lb/>
ises in mind, we will conclude our history of landscape design with a meditation on how all of us act as place-making agents as our moving bodies claim space and as we create forms and inscribe pat-<lb/>
terns upon the landscapes of the world, which are forever part of nature whatever our particular cultural values may be.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I. Body and Space: The Weaving of Place</hi></head>
<p>Within the span of an individual life, it is especially difficult to grasp the fundamental truth that every-<lb/>
thing, including the architecture of nature&#x2014;moun-<lb/>
tains, plains, rivers, seas&#x2014;is forever changing. Imposing order on nature and believing that the spaces we shape have permanence seem to be neces-<lb/>
sary imperatives for maintaining our bearings psy-<lb/>
chologically. Even when space is outside of our personal influence in terms of structure, we appro-<lb/>
priate it by the movements of our bodies.</p>
<p>Following Bachelard, we may think of our dwellings as nests of personal space and our craniums as the repositories in which are stored many remem-<lb/>
bered places, even, or especially, places erased by time. But we should not think of place as stationary. From the window of the moving automobile or, more sen-<lb/>
sationally, from the windswept, unprotected motor-<lb/>
cyclist's perspective, place is fluid, the streaming scenery of the highway.<ref target="#CH16-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref>What is important to under-<lb/>
stand is that whether we are in fast or slow motion, we are claiming space with the sensations experienced by our moving bodies while internalizing meanings of place through the impressions stored in our minds. Space can be thus likened to a loom, and our shut-<lb/>
tling motion as we traverse familiar habitats or explore unknown ones makes us weavers of place as we cre-<lb/>
ate a fabric of the mind with which to cloak our naked psyches and attach ourselves to the world.</p>
<p>We may observe that our feet trace and retrace habitual steps. In this way we weave and reweave the fabric of physical and psychological space, making ourselves at home in the world. Our weaving capa-<lb/>
bility is such that, like birds, some of us can live tran-<lb/>
sient lives and over their course borrow or build many nests that we call home. Thus adaptable, we are like other biological creatures, also weavers of space, place-making animals. To visualize this activity metaphorically we may think of strings with knots, or better, because it is a more maplike and therefore a more placelike image, intersecting lines in a field with dots. The strings or lines represent the routes we traverse and the knots or dots the stationary points where we settle for awhile.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Claiming Space</hi></head>
<p>The theoretical reweaving of unraveled place constitutes the work of archaeological anthropologists who attempt to understand the role of movement&#x2014;rit-<lb/>
ual processions, ceremonial dancing, pilgrimage to nature shrines, and so forth&#x2014;in the place-making activities and hence the landscape designs of Pale-<lb/>
olithic and Neolithic peoples. The Walbiri people in <name type="place">Australia</name>, a society of contemporary hunter-gatherers, demonstrate how habitual passage over traditional lines of movement invests landscape with significance and mythic content. The Walbiri have imposed on their territory a sacred web of tracks called songlines linking stations that are associated with totemic beings, or dreamings. These dreaming sites are ele-<lb/>
ments in a mnemonic system employed by the nomadic Walbiri, who must memorize the features of an arid locale where the scarcity of rainfall makes knowledge of potential water holes essential.<ref target="#CH16-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Walbiri dreaming sites, the locus of religious ceremonies, serve as landmarks within an otherwise indistinguishable desert landscape.<ref target="#CH16-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref>The totems of the Walbiri consist of various animals, astronomical features, the elements&#x2014;wind, rain, and fire&#x2014;and even some important human artifacts such as spears or digging sticks. Cultural heroes wandered along the established songlines in the mythic period known as dreamtime, which is conceived as both a long-ago and continuing category of existence.<ref target="#CH16-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> In dreamtime, these creative figures assumed human form, shaped topography, gave the landscape its features, and deposited their totemic essences in the places where they halted in their journeys before transforming themselves into animal or plant form and returning into the earth at a spot, usually of some topographi-<lb/>
cal distinction, that served as their memorial and prin-<lb/>
cipal shrine. Dreamtime continues as an alternative to historical time, and the impregnation of the ordi-<lb/>
nary world with its spiritual essences and the corre-<lb/>
sponding impregnation of human fetuses with the dreamings of their place of conception shape the identity of individual members of the society and affect their mutual relationships. By performing ritu-<lb/>
als at the dreaming sites, Walbiri men may enter dreamtime for a brief period, becoming the heroes they impersonate. The care of the dreaming sites and custodial responsibility for the rituals and songs belonging to them are assigned to individual lodges associated with each location. At Ngama Cave, located near Yuendumu in a valley with abundant game and where three songlines converge, one lodge continues to maintain the totemic wall paintings depicting snake, dingo, and wallaby.</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter Two, the ancient Greeks wove their colonial cities <hi rend="italic">per stringas,</hi> as bands of north-south and east-west streets forming a Hippo-<lb/>
damian grid, and then wove a looser net of territorial claims by extending pilgrimage routes to the shrines located near the limits of the <hi rend="italic">chora.</hi> By moving along processional routes into the countryside to the tem-<lb/>
ple shrines as well as by walking the streets of the <hi rend="italic">polis,</hi> people activated this fabric of space and inter-<lb/>
<pb n="505"/>
<pb n="505" type="orig"/>
nalized it as place.<ref target="#CH16-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> So, too, do we fashion from the patterns of our movement our notions of place. Thus place, which is coterminous with our own selves, is the claim our moving bodies make upon regional space, which, in accommodating our comings and goings, gains familiarity and accrues meaning. As phi-<lb/>
losophy historian Edward Casey reminds us, <hi rend="italic">"Bodies build places</hi> ... through inhabiting and even by travel-<lb/>
ing between already built places."<ref target="#CH16-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>Seen in this way, place is something that is sequenced like the Walbiri songlines by movement along routes that are punc-<lb/>
tuated with landmarks in which we have invested sig-<lb/>
nificance, if only the significance of customary sight. In the highly commercial capitalist societies of the West, the rituals of shopping and eating out are important components in our contemporary concept of <hi rend="italic">chora,</hi> the regional receptacle of place.</p>
<p>Place is therefore kinetic, a pattern of habitual movements through remembered space. Where our intuitive directional system based upon familiarity and repetition of experience breaks down, as when large numbers of strangers are in transit, passing through airports or train and bus stations, we substitute for our mental maps of place well-developed graphic sys-<lb/>
tems containing conventional international symbols. As highways, automobiles, and trucks have put more and more people on the move and made mass mar-<lb/>
keting and distribution systems commonplace, soci-<lb/>
ety's impulse has been to delocalize place by creating ubiquitous and predictable cultural geographies. Retail and hotel chains and other instantly recogniz-<lb/>
able commercial franchise operations such as service stations and fast-food restaurants thus become the denominators of the placeless place where anyone can presumably feel at home.</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter One, Puebloan people in the Southwest have woven place by establishing a flow of energy that also guides the people's footsteps between the pueblo and the inconspicuously stone-<lb/>
marked mountain shrines that establish the cosmo-<lb/>
logical paradigm within the landscape. Like the <hi rend="italic">agora</hi> of the Greek <hi rend="italic">polis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">bupingeh,</hi> or central plaza, con-<lb/>
stitutes the civic and social heart of the pueblo, and the <hi rend="italic">nansipu,</hi> the small stone-encircled depression within the <hi rend="italic">bupingeh,</hi> marks the cosmological axis mundi and the centerpoint of the spatial tapestry that extends from the pueblo in four directions to the encircling mountains that rim the horizon. But although the pueblo sacralizes space, it is not itself considered to be a sacred, immutable form, being sim-<lb/>
ply the temporary center of a people who may move to another location someday, allowing their adobe walls to melt back into the earth. The fixity of the pueblos as we know them today is a product of an Euro-American cultural construct that perceived nature in nonreligious terms as a commodity. The newcomers granted land by law as property or terri-<lb/>
tory with established boundary lines. By contrast, the migration of Pre-Columbian Native Americans is found in the archaeological record, particularly in the ruins of long-abandoned pueblos dotted across the Southwest.</p>
<p>Ironically, at the same time that post-Columbian Americans began to restrict the movements of Native Americans, they set themselves in motion, weaving a new American <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> of continental dimensions as they moved west to colonize the land. The warp and woof of Jefferson's national grid became a loom of spatial weaving such as the world had never seen before. Within the mile-square, 640-acre sections described by its orthogonal lines, fields and the smaller-scale grids of cities were established. But the actual roads that followed the engineers' surveys that mapped the national grid were not created until much later. Depressions in the prairie grass where the Great Plains end near Fort Union in eastern <name type="place">New Mexico</name> mark the ruts of the wagon wheels that formed the Santa Fe Trail. Frederick Law Olmsted, traveling in the antebellum South, found himself continually slowed down by the miry, rutted roads. With tolls but no federal taxes to support their establishment or upkeep, the roads of <name type="place">America</name> were all local for more than a century and a half of the republic's existence, making each region insular and all long-distance high-<lb/>
way travel an arduous adventure.</p>
<p>In Chapter Twelve we examined how this situ-<lb/>
ation changed as the automobile became a popular and increasingly dominant mode of transportation. The limited-access "townless highway" conceived by Benton MacKaye and the first motor parkways on Long Island and in Westchester County, <name type="place">New York</name>, were thought of as regional arteries and their purpose as primarily recreational, bringing newly mobi-<lb/>
lized city-dwellers nearer to nature. But following World War II, a powerful congressional lobby sup-<lb/>
porting motor transportation interests fostered the creation of interstate highways, and the United States became laced with expressways&#x2014;multilane arteries for trucks as well as cars. This national network sup-<lb/>
planted the earlier regional one featuring parkways. The journey was no longer its own reward; speed and absence of traffic congestion replaced motorized recreation as the engineer's primary goals. As park-<lb/>
way construction waned, landscape architects were rarely employed on roadway design projects, as was the case in the early twentieth century when the <name type="pname">Bronx River</name>, <name type="pname">Taconic</name>, <name type="pname">Merritt</name>, and other parkways in the <name type="place">New York</name> metropolitan region were built.</p>
<p>In the global, technology-oriented culture of the twentieth-first century, images of local and historical

place have become universalized through endless replications, and we have become infinitely more mobilized than participants in prior civilizations. Time and space are experienced differently, and the world has become a geography of flows: of people, of goods, and of information (fig. 16.1). The result is a multicultural landscape pastiche, a transcultural scenery of borrowed design motifs and symbols. We may lament the frenetic pace of contemporary life and long to get back to nature, but the journey can-<lb/>
not be accomplished without connection to the tech-<lb/>
nology of transportation flows.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Lawrence Halprin</name> understood this. In his <date when="1966">1966</date> essay on freeways he wrote:
<q>Freeways out in the countryside, with their graceful, sinuous, curvilinear patterns, are like great free-flowing paintings in which, through participation, the sensations of motion through space are experienced. In cities the great over-<lb/>
head concrete structures with their haunches tied to the ground and the vast flowing can-<lb/>
tilevers rippling above the local streets stand like enormous sculptures marching through the architectonic caverns. These vast and beautiful works of engineering speak to us in the lan-<lb/>
guage of a new scale, a new attitude in which high-speed motion and the qualities of change are not mere abstract conceptions but a vital part of our everyday experiences.<ref target="#CH16-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref></q></p>
<p>Followers of Jane Jacobs would caution against romanticizing the beauty of engineering and panoramic skyline vistas from freeways. These exhil-<lb/>
arating Faustian experiences of human power are all too often at the expense of existing neighborhoods, irremediably disrupting people's lives and social bonds. But that does not mean that all highway con-<lb/>
struction is inimical, especially were politicians and planners to heed the finest lesson offered by the Dis-<lb/>
ney Company's theme-park planners: a system of multiple, integrated transportation technologies aimed at creating neighborhood-sized, car-free envi-<lb/>
ronments. This goal would force careful considera-<lb/>
tion of exterior access and parking needs along with the interior infrastructure necessary to facilitate pedes-<lb/>
trian and light-rail transit flows.</p>
<p>An ethos of intelligent stewardship of Earth's biological and human environments and good frameworks for political decision-making are fun-<lb/>
damental if we are to successfully address with sci-<lb/>
entific, technical, and artistic means the global challenges that confront us. In Europe especially, regional planners have begun to think of conserva-<lb/>
tion in terms of the transportation costs associated with the environmental footprints of cities&#x2014;that is, the amount of far-flung hinterland necessary to sus-<lb/>
tain them with food, water, and energy&#x2014;and to mass buildings and preserve green space with stronger regard for the natural channels of air and water flowing through them.</p>
<p>The flows of images and information via satel-<lb/>
lite technology and the Internet provide new means of advancing global stewardship and promoting inte-<lb/>
grated international environmental management systems. To succeed fully, this stewardship must encompass a psychological and phenomenological attachment to place. We must therefore learn to value
<pb n="507"/>
<pb n="507" type="orig"/>
the qualities that constitute place and understand what it means to be a body that moves through space, a corporeal self at rest and in motion, a being that is capable of place making within the context of home, nature, and community.</p>
<p>Because mind and body cannot be divorced and because it is the mind that insists on organizing &#x2014; imposing order on&#x2014;space, place is, in fact, wherever we are physically. By being emplaced in space we ineluctably claim space as place. When the astronaut Neil Armstrong set his foot on the moon in <date when="1969">1969</date>, claiming a giant stride for humankind, the moon became a place as well as a heavenly body.</p>
<p>Movement is pleasure and often spiritual reward. Curious by nature, we are explorers, claiming place by venturing forth to look and learn, even if we have no intention of settling. Scaling the mountain sum-<lb/>
mit or diving below the ocean's surface imprints us with experience of place. Standing on the mesa or the open plain and watching the sun plunge beneath the horizon or, away from city lights, gazing into the dark immensity of the night sky at the Milky Way and the myriad stars produces in us the same sensation of cos-<lb/>
mological awe that prehistoric peoples converted into religious myth and calendrical calculation.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between mind-<lb/>
body space and abstract, intellectualized space. Alone among sentient creatures, human beings are capable of conceptualizing space in both real and abstract terms, as lived experience on the one hand and as car-<lb/>
tography, mathematical model, or cosmological dia-<lb/>
gram on the other. We have imposed a system of spatial coordinates&#x2014;longitude and latitude&#x2014;upon our planet as a universally agreed-upon aid to navi-<lb/>
gation. Satellites programmed to pinpoint position now beam information that can be captured by com-<lb/>
puters, giving drivers of automobiles or hikers in the wilderness accurate information about their current location and directions to their destinations. Survey-<lb/>
ors have made possible the mapping of virtually the entire surface of the globe with great precision and at a fine scale. To this base of topographical infor-<lb/>
mation, geographers and natural scientists, as well as demographers, economists, and political scientists, have added much useful information regarding cli-<lb/>
mate, geology, vegetation, wildlife habitat, the bound-<lb/>
aries of cities, states, and nations, and human road systems and settlement patterns. Map reading enables us to picture accurately places we have never seen, and cinematic and still photography at both aerial and ground level increases our ability to visualize remote places. Nevertheless, the <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> of space as place remains personal.</p>

<p>To go camping is to internalize spatial experience most vividly and to comprehend human place mak-<lb/>
ing in its most elemental form. Through availing themselves of all manner of technical aids, such as warm clothing made of industrially manufactured synthetic fibers, good topographical maps, or perhaps a handheld computer with satellite-beamed compass orientation, exact location, and directional informa-<lb/>
tion, the backcountry camper claims wilderness (first
<pb n="508"/>
<pb n="508" type="orig"/>
nature) as an experience of place by following trails. Blazed by the original explorers of wilderness, trails are tracks made by the feet of horses, cattle, and humans who have gone ahead (fig. 16.2). Each hiker who threads a way along these paths or bushwhacks with stream courses and sun position for guidance weaves out of spatial distance a personal experience of place. This takes the form of a composite of sen-<lb/>
sory impressions: the resinous pungency of pine, the low rumble from the thundercloud over the moun-<lb/>
tain; the darkness and cool of the forest with its car-<lb/>
pet of leaf litter, moss, ferns, and mushrooms; the picnic on a sun-warmed rock in the meadow of breeze-blown grasses and nodding wildflowers. If we are journalists, we may make of these experiences a string of words, for narrative is an important adjunct to place making, and even an illiterate camper will have his or her story of the Way.</p>
<p>Yet no story of a journey is without its caesuras, and no trek is without its pauses, breaks for rest and sleep. The camper, like the wayfarer seeking an inn for the night, must tie a knot in the string of space he or she is weaving, by selecting a temporary nest or den, the spot where a tent makes a home, the place where, cocooned in a sleeping bag and covered by a fragile shell of fabric, one sets forth on a voyage of nocturnal dreams. Or, dispensing with the insubstan-<lb/>
tial house that the tent represents, the camper joins those prehistoric ancestors who governed their lives through myth and celestial observation, studying the rotational movements of the bright lights overhead, still amazed, if not as wondering as they, about the cosmological meaning of those lights' majestic march across the heavens through the hours of darkness.</p>
<p>This exhilarating venture into nature, our first home, sharpens our senses, but we must not imag-<lb/>
ine that, even as campers relearning ancient skills, we can recover in wilderness the perspective of prehis-<lb/>
toric humankind. We may only imagine it from our own cultural vantage point. The vapor trail of the jet overhead and the distant roar of its engine as it courses along its prescribed skyway join the flight and cry of the jay, reminding us that we live in a world that is increasingly of our own making. Yet even our technologically derived environments are part of nature and must submit to nature's laws: this is the lesson of camping in those reserves of "first nature" that remain on a crowded planet.</p>

<p>Finally, we are place. The axis mundi of cosmology is imbedded in our unconscious because we walk upright. Because we walk upright we traverse space, making place through movement. If we are women, we have wombs, the primordial image of place as medium and matrix. In us abides the cave, prenatal paradise, and protected sanctuary. If we are men, we produce semen, the procreative male seed that fertil-<lb/>
izes the female egg residing in the uterus. As men we stand for the potency represented by storm clouds and mountain peaks; as women we symbolize the earth's fertile valleys and hidden recesses, holding, contain-<lb/>
ing, embracing life within our wombs and in our arms. Together women and men shape space and make place by virtue of our movements and our decisions.</p>
<p>To deconstruct space is to immediately reor-<lb/>
ganize it intellectually, for the ordering principle of our brain is much stronger than our will to acquiesce to formless, spatial chaos. To feel at sea, uncentered, adrift in undifferentiated, essentially placeless space, is to experience an unbearable sense of disorder and confusion, like the oppressive weight of darkness and silence in a sealed tomb or airless dungeon. Even in these dire circumstances, however, as long as we are aware of our spatial anxiety, experiencing our palpi-<lb/>
tating heart and dry-mouthed, wet-palmed fear, we are in place, being, so to speak, in body.</p>
<p>Settlements, especially cities, accrue meaning over time, although this meaning is always changing. Within cities, the more numerous and significant sacred spaces are, the greater the city. Because cities are fabrics of space dense with buildings, sometimes their most sacred spaces are their unbuilt places: the agora, the monumental plaza or square, the public park. These are the amply filled-in blanks within the metropolitan spatial continuum. In fact, parks and parklike open spaces are sometimes the most pow-<lb/>
erful definers of place, important markers in the men-<lb/>
tal geography of every resident beyond the age of early childhood when the concept of space is still lim-<lb/>
ited, not yet expanded beyond mother, home, yard, and immediate neighborhood. One senses with spe-<lb/>
cial force, and sometimes poignance, the vitality and persistence of the human urge to interact with nature and to create satisfying places in the community gar-<lb/>
den, a provisional landscape occupying temporarily vacant urban land. The community garden contra-<lb/>
dicts facile assumptions regarding urban dwellers' indifference to nature and predictions about the death of public space. Within these and other superficially insignificant, often marginal spaces can be found expressions of ethnic identity, spiritual fulfillment, and economic improvement.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Community Gardens</hi></head>
<p>With the alteration of the social landscape of <name type="place">Amer-<lb/>
ica</name> following World War II, the inner urban ring became less dense and more racially mixed as both migrants and immigrants took up residence. The drop in real estate values that made rents in these
<pb n="509"/>
<pb n="509" type="orig"/>
areas affordable for newcomers also gave landlords less incentive to maintain their properties. With the advent of the civil rights movement in the <date when="1960">1960</date>s and the riots sparked by police confrontation with those demanding racial equality, some of these neighbor-<lb/>
hoods experienced wanton destruction. In the wake of the rioting, many landlords simply deserted their destroyed properties and already deteriorated build-<lb/>
ings. With no utility or maintenance services, these sites were also abandoned by their tenants. Eventu-<lb/>
ally many buildings were torn down and their sites left as rubble-strewn open space. With no remittance of the taxes due on them, municipal real estate departments were forced to claim these properties.</p>
<p>But still there were people who called the neigh-<lb/>
borhoods surrounding these lots home, and as <name type="pname">Sam Bass Warner</name>, Jr., points out, "today's American urban community garden is the child of new politics and abandoned city land."<ref target="#CH16-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref>Some of these gardens have become showcases of ornamental horticulture as well as green retreats, recreational centers in which to relax and socialize (fig. 16.3).</p>
<p>In spite of the community gardens' popularity, many public officials believe that they are not the best use of random parcels of city-owned land when meas-<lb/>
ured against the need for housing and their desire to generate revenues from taxes and land sales to devel-<lb/>
opers. Those who turn open spaces into green places through the investment of their creativity, time, and labor&#x2014;gaining for themselves a sense of place in the process&#x2014;are confronted by those with superior power over land because of ownership and the ability to regulate its use. This power stems from a value sys-<lb/>
tem in which land is considered a commodity and place as something fungible. In <name type="pname">Boston</name>, <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="place">Chicago</name>, and Seattle, however, a new ethic that attempts to balance green space with the need for housing and municipal revenues is emerging, and gov-<lb/>
ernmentally sponsored redevelopment programs in these American cities are being undertaken within the context of neighborhood-based city planning.</p>
<p>Whether gardens are urban or suburban, of our own making or ones we create with the help of pro-<lb/>
fessional designers, they are personal paradises where we find soul space, our places for dreaming, family life, play, and entertaining friends. But these are not the only cherished landscapes. For some, Central Park or the city of <name type="place">Paris</name> are homes for the heart even more valued than their own abodes, place being as much as anything a state of mind. As our bodies and minds claim space and live place, everywhere can be utopia, which literally means <hi rend="italic">nowhere,</hi> but which we are able by our acts of imagination and will to convert into our own visionary <hi rend="italic">somewhere.</hi> We ourselves <hi rend="italic">are</hi> place, but we are also forever <hi rend="italic">in</hi> place, whether moving or at rest. To feel connected and centered in the world is to know how to find our way, to navigate ourselves spatially and locate ourselves in the small temporary centers we call home. Because we live in communi-<lb/>
ties, not in isolation, our decisions and those of oth-<lb/>
ers affect the nature of place both individually and collectively with regard to the societal arrangements we create to structure the allocation and use of space and the examples and standards we set forth with regard to landscape design.</p>

<p>Our journey through landscape design history has enabled us to see that populism is ascendant in our time and that, although often vulnerable to super-<lb/>
ior economic forces, landscapes like community gar-<lb/>
dens are important expressions of culture and individual aspiration. When we look at the entire built landscape we see that it is a fabric woven by count-<lb/>
less individuals. The term <hi rend="italic">vernacular</hi> is often applied to landscapes that manifest place-making by ordinary people. To make generalized observations about this type of human landscape, it is necessary to adopt the analytic approach of the cultural geographer.</p>

<p>Histories have been written since ancient Greek times, and landscape inevitably figures in the narratives of battle scenes and descriptions of locales of human set-<lb/>

At that time, when the pursuit of knowledge became increasingly specialized, geography evolved from its cartographic origins to become a combination of earth science and social science, with an emphasis upon the economic potential of natural resources. Not until the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, however, did a group of French geographers attempt to project an intimate portrait of the settled regional countryside.

lution of its landscape. By roaming the countryside on foot and bicycle and studying its surface features, vegetation patterns, transportation lines, and build-<lb/>
ings, Hoskins made his readers aware that landscape could be read as a fascinating document, a morpho-<lb/>
logical record of other times and other lives. Hoskins cherished the vestigial evidence of continuous human occupation over the centuries and the patina of ancient heritage he found in long-settled landscapes, and he was vociferously alarmed by the twentieth century's highly mechanized, capitalist culture that disrupted these historic landscape patterns. Although his work was slow to win a popular audience, by the <date when="1970">1970</date>s his academic post, a television series featuring Hoskins and the English countryside, and paperback republication of his remarkable book sparked con-<lb/>

<p><name type="pname">John Brinckerhoff Jackson</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1996">1996</date>) took a related but very different stance from Hoskins.<ref target="#CH16-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref><name type="pname">Jack-<lb/>
son</name>'s attention to landscape at a local scale, combined with an artist's eye for visual form and an appreciation of architecture, nurtured his interest in "reading" the landscape. He saw how he could apply the experience he had gained as an intelligence officer in wartime Europe to analyze the landscape of his adopted region, the American Southwest, and how the process of deci-<lb/>
phering its cultural meanings could lead to a broader perspective on the relationship between humankind and nature. <hi rend="italic">Landscape,</hi> the magazine that he began publishing three times a year in <date when="1951">1951</date>, was his princi-<lb/>
pal forum for the next seventeen years.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Like Patrick Geddes</name>, <name type="pname">Jackson</name> was fascinated with aerial perspective as a means of interpreting human settlements, but he did not share Geddes's motives as a city planner. He wanted his readers sim-<lb/>
ply to recognize and appreciate the social, economic, and cultural forces that had shaped "the compact Indian communities, perched on rocks overlooking the fields, the sprawling tree-grown checkerboard of the Anglo-American towns, the Spanish villages strung along a road or a stream; the huddle of filling stations and tourist courts at highway intersections in the desert."<ref target="#CH16-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref> In addition, there was the individual house, which <name type="pname">Jackson</name> viewed as a manifestation of culture as well as an expression of certain spiritual and biological needs.</p>
<p>The road, emblem of restless movement and the means of continental migration, resides within the American imagination as an important image. Jackson, who traversed the country many times by motorcycle, made the road an important, recurring subject in his work. Unlike the critics of urban and rural visual blight, he never deplored the effect of the automobile on the landscape (fig. 16.4). He saw speed as an exhilarating sensory stimulus, and he would not deny the abstract beauty of "the new landscape, seen at a rapid, sometimes even a terrifying pace."<ref target="#CH16-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref> The American highway was for him a collective work of industrial-age folk art, and he applied to the honky-<lb/>
tonk roadside strip of motels, gas stations, used-car lots, and fast-food franchises the same dispassionate
<pb n="511"/>
<pb n="511" type="orig"/>
perspective that allowed him to view side yards filled with rusting automobiles and other eyesores as evi-<lb/>
dence of people's means of gaining a livelihood. His article on "The Stranger's Path" describes the tawdry vitality of the route from the bus or train depot on the urban fringe to skid row, the business district, and civic center. He was interested in the ability of people at the bottom rung of society to find accommo-<lb/>
dation and even a sense of place within the landscape. Thus, landscape was for Jackson never something merely to look at, but to live in. From this attitude stemmed his aversion to modernism in architecture and city planning, even when architects and planners attempted to implement a thoroughly democratic agenda. He doubted that even intelligent suburban landscape design such as Garrett Eckbo's, whose book <hi rend="italic">Landscape for Living</hi> Jackson criticized as too abstract, could serve as effectively as grassroots place-making.</p>

<p>Besides validating landscape studies as a field that included mobile homes and trailer courts, <name type="pname">Jack-<lb/>
son</name> argued against the dichotomous attitude that sees nature and urbanity as polar opposites. In his unified vision, nature was all-pervasive, and he took pains to point out that the same forces of climate, topogra-<lb/>
phy, and vegetative growth that appear in the unbuilt countryside operate equally within the built city. Unlike Hoskins, who wished to arrest landscape change and ugly Machine Age incursions that be-<lb/>
spoke contemporary people's increasing alienation from nature, Jackson stressed the inevitability of land-<lb/>
scape's ever-changing character.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Jackson</name> honed his iconoclastic perspective as a means of jolting conventional attitudes, especially the Romantic attitude toward nature promulgated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and later Henry David Thoreau, but he never developed an analytical methodology, nor did he work in any programmatic way to bring about environmental improvement. His principal legacy lies in stimulating a more humanis-<lb/>

</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Conclusion</hi></head>
<p>As we have seen throughout this book, people have sought at certain times and places a correspondence between abstract, philosophical notions of space and designed manifestations of place. The builders of the cities of Ur, Knossos, and Teotihuac&#x00E1;n centered their constructions in landscape space according to a cos-<lb/>
mological diagram. At Vaux-le-Vicomte and Versailles there is a firm relationship between Cartesian cos-<lb/>
mology and experiential space. The desire for a cor-<lb/>
respondence between philosophical and scientific concepts of space and landscape can be seen in our own day, as is evident from some of the Earthworks discussed in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>But the grounding of spatial abstractions in the landscape is only part of the story of place making. The force of history as inspiration for designing space has only increased during the last two hundred years. The cachet of history and historic places has never been more evident than now as civilization embarks upon its third millennium of the Common Era. The several styles prefaced with "neo&#x2014;" attest to this. Beyond mere stylistic reiteration, history as a sal-<lb/>
vaging of the past and sometimes a literal replication and re-creation of place has garnered the momentum and resources of an international preservation movement. With the perceived endangerment of place, archaeological sites and landmarks are being pro-<lb/>
tected from alteration. The consumption of history by tourists has become a powerful motive for the cur-<lb/>
rent reweaving of place. Old town centers, such as
<pb n="512"/>
<pb n="512" type="orig"/>
war-devastated Dresden, are being rebuilt, historic vil-<lb/>
lages are being saved as exquisite corpses, their old functional lives now <hi rend="italic">replaced</hi> by their new role as tourist destinations. Tourist accommodation neces-<lb/>
sarily alters the thus-valorized space. By way of exam-<lb/>
ple, the route leading to the sacred cave of Zeus on Mount Ida (see Chapter One) has been recently sur-<lb/>
faced with asphalt paving to facilitate the arrival and parking of buses.</p>

</figure>
<p>To value the vernacular landscape is to attest to the fundamental implausibility of master planning; no one can predict more than the basic functional needs of others, and human needs are neither uni-<lb/>
versal nor static. While some regulation of land use is in the common interests of all who live together in a society, everyday environments are continually being improvised and reinvented within this spatial frame-<lb/>
work as the social circumstances of lives change, new economic opportunities arise out of new technolo-<lb/>
gies, and new desires are born (fig. 16.5). And yet, in all the transactions that go on between human beings and nature, there is the impulse to arrest the fluidity of place, to save what is still held dear, and to renew the old as a representation of the desirable values that are believed to reside in certain bygone periods of his-<lb/>
tory, even when the meaning of that period to con-<lb/>
temporary people is undergoing change along with everything else.</p>
<p>Because of its use of industrial technology&#x2014;exemplified by machine guns, fire bombs, gas cham-<lb/>
bers, rail transport to death camps, and other heinous applications&#x2014;in the brutally efficient <hi rend="italic">displacement</hi> of populations and eradication of spatial structure, the twentieth century witnessed more forced evacuation of place and destruction of spatial meaning than any other. In that century it became apparent that indus-<lb/>
trial technology is a power that can efficiently destroy the natural environment for short-term economic gain, impoverishing irreplaceable ecosystems, includ-<lb/>
ing the human ecosystem, and in some places destroy-<lb/>
ing entire species with ferocious rapidity. But technology is not innately inimical, and it is also being used to improve the conditions and duration of human life, while environmental science is working to restore degraded ecosystems. In this light, place is the planet Earth, a collective human responsibility.</p>
<p>In our survey of cities, parks, and gardens we have examined landscapes as shaped space and defined place. In bringing our journey to an end, it is important to realize that the making and erasure of place are continuous processes, as is the philosophi-<lb/>
cal conceptualization of space. These transactional activities between human beings and landscape will continue as long as there are minds to inquire about the cosmological meaning of space and to confer col-<lb/>
lective and personal meaning on place, and as long as there are hands, assisted by machines, to shape space in partnership with nature.</p>

<note xml:id="CH16-n5" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="bold">5.</hi></seg><p>Foucault's position is that "the coherence that existed, throughout the Classical age," which he assumes to be the seventeenth century, the period of the dawn of modern science, "between the theory of represen-<lb/>
tation and the theories of language, or the natural orders, and of wealth and value" was shattered beginning in the nineteenth century. With this change, "the theory of representation disappears as the universal foundation of all possible orders; language as the spontaneous <hi rend="italic">tabula,</hi> the primary grid of things, as an indispensable link between representation and things, is eclipsed in its turn; a profound historicity penetrates into the heart of things, isolates and defines them in their own coherence, imposes upon them the forms of order implied by the continuity of time; the analysis of exchange and money gives way to the study of pro-<lb/>
duction, that of the organism takes prece-<lb/>
dence over the search for taxonomic characteristics, and, above all, language loses its privileged position and becomes, in its turn, a historical form coherent with the density of its own past."

Baroque design forms originated in <name type="place">Italy</name> at the end of the sixteenth century and flourished there and in <name type="place">Germany</name>, Austira, and Spain during seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. A highly theatrical approach to design, the Baroque sensibility penetrated but never domi-<lb/>

sponding biological life.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold">borrowed scenery</hi> The design principle of tak-<lb/>
ing into account scenic views beyond the con-<lb/>
fines of the garden and planning the garden with reference to them. Chinese garden design-<lb/>
ers frequently used borrowed scenery, <hi rend="italic">jie jing,</hi> in their designs. Japanese gardeners imaginatively exploited the same design technique and term, which they pronounced as <hi rend="italic">shakkei,</hi> and some Western landscape architects, such as the Brazilian Roberto Burle Marx, have adopted a similar approach, composing gardens that include within their visual frame natural scenery outside their boundaries.</item>

dence; but in cases where a villa might be used simply for a day's sojourn, it signifies the plea-<lb/>
sure pavilion that serves as its principal archi-<lb/>
tectural structure. The term was adopted by English-speaking people and used to denote certain ornamental pavilions and refreshment structures in gardens and parks in Britain and America. It is also used to signify a gaming hall where gambling and other forms of entertain-<lb/>
ment take place.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">castellum</hi></hi> The Latin term for castle or fortress; used also to denote a large architectural display fountain constructed as a rule to signal an aqueduct's formal point of entry into the city.

vation of tender plants in the winter; a green-<lb/>
house or glass house. In the nineteenth century, although many conservatories were important, domed, freestanding glass struc-<lb/>
tures large enough to accommodate the growth of tall palm trees, the term <hi rend="italic">conservatory</hi> also came to denote a glass-covered extension of a house, accessible from a principal room, where exotic plants are displayed.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">corso</hi></hi> An Italian term signifying a principal thoroughfare, corso assumed new meaning as driving became a fashionable recreation in <name type="place">Rome</name> and elsewhere after the appearance of spring-hung carriages in the early seventeenth century.</item>

<item><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">feng shui</hi></hi> Translated from the Chinese as "wind and water<hi rend="italic">," feng shui</hi> is the practice of profes-<lb/>
sional geomancers who divine beneficial and malign influences within a particular location, thereby determining favorable sites and align-<lb/>
ments for buildings and gardens while also neutralizing objectional aspects of the land-<lb/>

<item>ferme orn&#x00E9;e The French term for ornamental farm used by the English after Stephen Switzer appropriated it in <hi rend="italic">The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation</hi> (<date when="1715">1715</date>) to promote the arrangement of agricultural estates as aestheti-<lb/>
cally pleasing compositions in which, typically, the hedgerows separating fields were enhanced with shrubs, vines, and flowers, an occasional monument was placed in a manner calculated to provoke poetic association, and a circuit drive laid out to enable movement through the landscape.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">folie</hi></hi> The French term for folly, a garden struc-<lb/>
ture intended as an evocation of past cultures or faraway places. <hi rend="italic">Folies,</hi> which can be likened to theatrical scenery, were sometimes used to camouflage useful buildings, such as dairies, barns, or icehouses, but they often served no utilitarian purpose at all.

<pb n="516"/>
<pb n="516" type="orig"/>
composed of an image pecked into the surface of a stony piece of ground.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi></hi> The Italian term for a secret garden, a secluded and enclosed garden room commonly found in villa gardens of the Renaissance and seventeenth century.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">giocchi d'acqua</hi></hi> The Italian term for water games. <hi rend="italic">Giocchi d'acqua</hi> were fountain effects designed by hydraulic engineers during the Renaissance to add an element of amusement to the garden experience as visitors, who unin-<lb/>
tentionally activated jets of water from hidden sources, were treated to surprise drenchings as a practical joke.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold">great house</hi> In <name type="place">England</name>, the palatial mansion of an aristocratic country estate.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold">greenhouse</hi> A structure similar to a conserva-<lb/>
tory or an orangery in that it was originally con-<lb/>
ceived as a means of overwintering garden greenery that had been imported from warmer climates. With the increase of plant material by botanical discovery and the advance of horticul-<lb/>
tural science beginning in the eighteenth centu-<lb/>
ry, greenhouses were used for propagation as well as for the winter protection of tender plants. To promote indoor plant growth it was necessary to obtain a greater amount of sun-<lb/>
light than was admitted by orangeries and other masonry, windowed structures; in <date when="1816">1816</date>, John Claudius Loudon invented a curvilinear sash bar of wrought iron, which led to the construc-<lb/>
tion of greenhouses that admitted light from above. Because of its nearly all-glass construc-<lb/>
tion, the greenhouse is sometimes referred to as a <hi rend="italic">glasshouse.</hi> A greenhouse may be an inde-<lb/>
pendent, freestanding structure or attached to the side of a house.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold">grotto</hi> A natural cave, which has acquired human significance because of the spiritual forces presumed to inhabit it; also an architec-<lb/>
tural version of a cave, usually rustic in charac-<lb/>
ter and often containing water and sometimes sculptural representations of its presiding spir-<lb/>
its. Grottoes that are identified with nymphs are often called nymphaeums.</item>
</list>
<list>
<item><hi rend="bold">ha-ha</hi> A fairly deep boundary ditch, invisible from a few feet away and serving the purpose of a fence separating the garden from the fields where cattle graze. The ha-ha was conceived in the eighteenth century to give the illusion of continuity between the garden or residential park and the rural landscape beyond.

ized, like the large-scale pyramid, the life-giving, sun-blessed mound, the sacred <hi rend="italic">ben-ben,</hi> revered is association with the worship of the Sun god Re. With its implicit promise of rebirth after death, the obelisk was appropriated in Western culture as a Christian symbol during the Renaissance when several toppled obelisks that had been garnered by the imperial Roman armies were surmounted by Christian crosses and erected once more in public places in <name type="place">Rome</name>. By the eighteenth century, because of its symbolic association with the afterlife, the obelisk had become a commonly accepted form for funerary and memorial monuments, and many miniature obelisks began to be used as grave markers, especially in the non-sectarian rural cemeteries built in the nineteenth century.</item>

teenth century and practiced in <name type="place">England</name>, on the Continent, and in America in variant forms until the end of the nineteenth century. Although the design of English landscapes had been previ-<lb/>
ously influenced by paintings, notably those of Claude Lorrain, the seventeenth-century French painter of the Roman Campagna, it was the air of rugged wildness characteristic of the land-<lb/>
scapes of Salvator Rosa that Picturesque land-<lb/>
scape designers cultivated. Contemporary with
<pb n="518"/>
<pb n="518" type="orig"/>
the Rococo, the Picturesque style often incorpo-<lb/>
rated Rococo effects, particularly in <name type="place">France</name> where Rococo taste originated. French Picturesque gardens also embodied the influ-<lb/>
ence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and thus express the sentimental view of nature and imply the virtues of life uncorrupted by society that is characteristic of one of the principal authors of Romanticism. The penchant for rus-<lb/>
ticity found in French Picturesque landscapes is also derived from an admiration of Dutch sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century landscape painting as well as the works of French eighteenth-century artists Claude-Henri Watelet, François Boucher, and Hubert Robert.</item>

prise the angles of a square or rectangle, while the fifth serves to mark its center. The term often denotes a regular arrangement of trees set in a pattern composed of multiple units of five. When the qunicunx form is thus used repetitively in the planting of a bosk, the result-<lb/>

teenth-century aesthetic movement fostered by the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Derived from <hi rend="italic">romance,</hi> the medieval genre of storytelling fea-<lb/>

terpart of classicism, and as such it values the individual and the subjective over the universal and the normative, holds the commonplace in high esteem, and does not look to Greece and <name type="place">Rome</name> for inspiration, finding it rather in the landscapes of nature that are characterized as sublime as well as in Picturesque scenery.</item>

<item><hi rend="bold">rural cemetery</hi> The result of religious and sani-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Index</hi></head>
<div type="section">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Subject matter</hi></head>
<p>This index is a comprehensive guide to the text of this book, covering names, places, and subject matter. Both detailed and more general information are listed in the index. Users should look up material under the most specific heading desired. For instance, readers searching only for material about Parc Monceau, <name type="place">Paris</name>, should look up Parc Monceau, not <name type="place">Paris</name>; but those looking for more general infor-<lb/>
mation about <name type="place">Paris</name>, or <name type="place">Paris</name> during partic-<lb/>
ular historical periods, should look under <name type="place">Paris</name>. Material in the notes is covered when it is substantive rather than referen-<lb/>
tial. Glossary entries are indexed; the bibli-<lb/>
ography is not indexed. Scholars are listed in the index when their work is discussed in the text, but not when it is provided chiefly as a reference. Titles of published works, poems, and literary works are indexed when discussed in the text, but not when provided chiefly as references. Such titles are indicated by italic typeface.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Page references</hi></head>
<p>In entries with subheadings, page refer-<lb/>
ences immediately following the main heading indicate general information and the chief areas of discussion for this topic. Where practicable and useful, bold page references indicate the most important section on the referenced topic in a string of locators. Illustrations and their captions are indicated separately from textual page references by italic typeface. If the topic occurs in both illustration/caption and text, both will be referenced (e.g., "286, 286").</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Dates</hi></head>
<p>Dates for historical figures are given in parentheses following their names as main entries in the index, when these dates are available from the text. Dates without nota-<lb/>
tions are birth and death dates ("<date when="1727">1727</date>-<date when="1788">1788</date>"). If only the birth date is known (or if the person is still living), this will be indi-<lb/>
cated with a b. ("b. <date when="1724">1724</date>"). If only the death date is known, this will be indicated with a d. ("d. <date when="1832">1832</date>"). The abbreviation c. (for circa) indicates the date is an approxi-<lb/>
mation. The abbreviation r. indicates a ruler's reigning dates. The abbreviation fl. stands for "flourished," indicating a cen-<lb/>
tralized date of activity for the person in question. The abbreviations "b.c.e." and "c.e." indicate "before common era" and "common era" dates.</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphabetization</hi></head>
<p>The index is alphabetized using "word-by-<lb/>
word" conventions instead of "letter-by-let-<lb/>
ter." This means that individual words are given their full weight. In word-by-word alphabetization, the proper order of the following terms would be: <name type="place">New England</name> towns; <name type="place">New York</name> state parks; Newburgh, NY; Newton, Isaac. (In letter-by-letter, the order would be: Newburgh, NY; <name type="place">New England</name> towns; Newton, Isaac; <name type="place">New York</name> state parks.) The particles "the" and "a" in English, "die" in German, "i" in Italian, and "le" in French, are sometimes retained as the initial word for purposes of sense, but such entries are always alphabetized under the second word (thus, The Bronze Horseman will be found under "Bronze").</p>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Proper names</hi></head>
<p>Alphabetizing conventions for compound proper names (Madame de la Valliere, Le Prestre de Vauban, Soria y Mata) are com-<lb/>
plex, and vary depending upon country of origin. To make things easier for the user, in this index proper names containing</p>
<p>such particles as La/la, Le/le, De/de, Van/van and Von/von are alphabetized under both the particle and the main por-<lb/>
tion of the name (thus, Le Prestre de Vauban will be found under Le, Prestre, de, and Vauban.) Proper names of medieval persons and royal personages without true last names are alphabetized under both their first names and, where appropriate, their title or nomenclature (Thomas Aquinas, for instance, is found under both Thomas and Aquinas).</p>
