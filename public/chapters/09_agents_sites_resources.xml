The desire to perceive order and meaning in the universe is pervasive throughout human history and continues to govern some of our most deep-seated psychological and religious attitudes. In the West, however, as the Scientific Revolution gained momentum through the eighteenth century and political revolutions discredited entrenched power structures, the impulse to reflect in landscape terms a cosmological paradigm proclaiming divine order and elite authority diminished. As the theories of <name type="pname" target="7000">Newton</name> were proved and extended by later scientific endeavor and became incorporated into the general cultural consciousness, intellectuals increasingly abandoned the quest for teleological meaning, concentrating instead on empirical explanations of the material world. Faith in reason and individual human action resulted in the substitution of personal judgment for blind obedience to authority, with significant political consequences as monarchies were toppled or their powers severely curtailed in favor of republican forms of government. For some people, faith in scientific progress displaced faith in supernatural powers and divine intervention in earthly affairs. For them, and for those who reconciled science with faith, the betterment of the conditions of life on Earth, not preparation for the hereafter, became the business of humankind.</p><p>Science assumed the authority previously enjoyed by religion and philosophy, which were demoted from their position as allencompassing, culture-defining thought systems to being spiritual and intellectual disciplines. The unprecedented knowledge and technological results achieved by the Western pursuit of science, voyages of global exploration, and colonial expansion made Europeans, though arrogant in their presumption of world hegemony, at least more cognizant of other cultural perspectives. Travel also furthered the growing interest in natural science, and with the philosophical shift from teleology to scientific materialism, chemistry, biology, geology, and botany began to be pursued with the same fervor as the study of celestial bodies had been in former centuries when astrology was believed to govern human fate.</p><p>This pursuit of natural science had profound consequences for religion and philosophy, especially after <name type="pname" target="9000">Charles Darwin</name> (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) published <hi rend="italic" target="9066">The Origin of Species</hi> in <date when="1859">1859</date>. <name type="pname" target="9003">Galileo</name> had long ago made it clear that Earth was no longer the center of the universe, but it now became apparent that humans were products of an evolutionary biology that linked them with the rest of the animal kingdom. Though bitterly resisted in some quarters, the same science that had caused human beings to modify their notions of their own nature and that of the cosmos also held the promise of untold material benefits.</p><p>But the power of people acting on their own behalf was often limited by their mistakes and misbegotten ideologies. In addition, humanity's growing power to control its destiny sometimes produced results that were not necessarily beneficial to Earth or even humankind in the long term. <name type="pname" target="9000">Darwin</name>'s theories necessarily took into account geological time and a dynamics of Earth in which forces of crustal uplift and erosion shaped the land, which was continually being recarved by wind, rain, and ice. Circumstances of geography and climate created ecological niches for species.<ref target="#CH9-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>Now, in the nineteenth century, it became apparent to a few that the human species was capable of destroying other species and limiting its own future welfare as it continued to modify the environment by felling trees and clearing land for agriculture. This removal of native vegetation destroyed natural drainage systems, accelerated erosion, and altered climate.</p><p><name type="pname" target="9001">George Perkins Marsh</name> (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>), American diplomat and early environmentalist, wrote <hi rend="italic" target="9036">Man and Nature</hi> (<date when="1864">1864</date>) as a stern warning against this calamitous course of unchecked abuse of nature. Just as <name type="pname" target="9000">Darwin</name>'s theories made some people revise their understanding of the Biblical creation story and regard it as myth<pb n="312"/><pb n="312" type="orig"/>and metaphor instead of gospel, so <name type="pname" target="9001">Marsh</name>'s views made unworkable the notion of the Creator making Earth solely for humanity's exploitation. For Western Christian societies, to look at landscape in ecological and conservationist terms as <name type="pname" target="9001">Marsh</name> did was to question the wisdom of the scriptural injunction in Genesis 1:28 to "fill the earth and subdue it." Dominion without enlightened husbandry, according to <name type="pname" target="9001">Marsh</name>, spelled destruction.</p><p>The difficulty that practicing Christians and Jews in the nineteenth century had reconciling their beliefs with the challenging new theories of science and humanity's role as God's partner and steward of Earth rather than His mere ward should not be minimized. Intellectually and morally, the late eighteenth century had in the nations of the West consolidated the Scientific Revolution that had begun in the sixteenth, while at the same time giving birth to the Industrial Revolution. Now, in the nineteenth century, the unsettling vision <name type="pname" target="7010">Goethe</name>(<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>) had limned in <hi rend="italic" target="7029">Faust Part II</hi> of nature overmastered by humanity in the form of the engineer and the developer was becoming a palpable reality. Romantics, following <name type="pname" target="7006">Rousseau</name> and <name type="pname" target="7011">Wordsworth</name>, found in wild nature the scenery of the sublime, a source of spiritual solace no longer available to those who had begun to question the premises of inherited religion. At the same time, the longing for the promise of redemptive salvation offered the faithful in earlier Christian centuries continued, and churchgoing remained a strongly rooted social convention and religious belief a personal need and cultural habit for many in the West.</p><p>The English writer and pioneer art critic <name type="pname" target="7238">John Ruskin</name> (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) promoted an aesthetics that was rooted in the study of nature, which he equated with Truth. By preaching a philosophy of Beauty with the same fervor as ministers of the Evangelical tradition in which he had been raised, <name type="pname" target="7238">Ruskin</name> furthered the modern notion that the appreciation and practice of art could serve as a source of spiritual life rather than simply as a manifestation of it. Like others of his generation, <name type="pname" target="7238">Ruskin</name> was appalled by the dehumanization he perceived to be a result of industrial capitalism's advance, and he sought to revive the artisanship associated with the medieval period, a time when craft guilds flourished and Gothic stone carvers' close observation of nature resulted in a vigorously vital style of ornamentation. The American writers <name type="pname" target="9005">Ralph Waldo Emerson</name> (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) and <name type="pname" target="7088">Henry David Thoreau</name> (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">1862</date>) met science's challenge to religion with transcendentalism, the literary and philosophical movement that advocated intuition as a mode of perception transcending empiricism.</p><p>Whether reacting against or incorporating the implications of modern science and Darwinism, few in the nineteenth century reckoned that further blows to humanity's self-esteem and relationship with past tradition had yet to be assimilated. But the insights of <name type="pname" target="7227">Friedrich Nietzsche</name> (<date when="1844">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) and <name type="pname" target="9008">Sigmund Freud</name> (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1939">1939</date>) established the intellectual climate of much of the twentieth century, a radical modernity in which people no longer looked to past traditions for inspiration and a sense of continuity with history; instead, they looked to the present and future as the only reliable basis for knowledge and human advancement. Even those who remained religious in outlook increasingly considered themselves their own best earthly guides. Humanitarian social consciousness thus pervaded Western ideology, and utopian schemes flourished. This, abetted by widespread religious skepticism and atheism, helped create a cultural climate that gradually became receptive to, and more tolerant of, religious and social pluralism.</p><p>The consequences for landscape within the secular, highly energetic, increasingly cosmopolitan framework of nineteenthcentury Western culture were enormous. In terms of landscape history, the public parks movement is a signal contribution of the nineteenth century to modern urbanism. As more purely aesthetic values supplanted ideological ones in landscape design, the eighteenth-century Picturesque idiom remained viable for the creation of nineteenth-century parks and gardens. Many aristocrats destroyed the geometrical gardens of their ancestral seats as the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> continued to be popular throughout nineteenth century Europe, an emblem of the social progressiveness of their owners. At the same time, theorists and practitioners adopted a more catholic approach to landscape aesthetics, and the doctrinal fervor and invective that had characterized the design disputes of the eighteenth century were replaced by an eclecticism in which individual taste was given increasingly broad license. History as a cultural value in its own right and an intellectual framework for preserving and imitating past styles replaced commitment to a single style reflecting a consensual ideology. Geometrical design was allowed back into English gardens, and the display of exotic plant material became a mark of the Victorian style called <hi rend="italic">Gardenesque.</hi></p><p>From our own historical vantage point, the nineteenth century's faith in scientific progress and planning as a means toward utopian human fulfillment seems overconfident, a heady and overweening attitude that produced unforeseen consequences. The hypocrisies and inequalities of this extraordinary age are all too glaring. Although the Industrial Revolution fostered capitalist economies in the West, which produced a broad middle class and brought a cornucopia of goods and comforts to many, it was wrenching for others, causing large-scale migrations that tore people away from their homes and homelands. Those dispossessed from an immediate connection with landscapes of important sentimental and psychological value often endured, in addition, squalid living conditions in rapidly growing cities. Republican governments proved no more immune to corruption and class distinctions than those based upon aristocratic privilege and social hierarchy. Colonialism, which reached its zenith in the nineteenth century, was generally callous in its disregard of native cultural values, attempting to establish Western mores as universal while relegating nonEuropean races to inferior status. Even after it became a sovereign nation, the United States accomplished the settlement of its continental territory under a similar cultural imperative.</p><p>At the same time, this period in Western history demonstrated the benefits of science as the foundations for modern medicine were laid, public sanitation victories achieved, better living conditions established, and faster means of transportation and communication developed. Scientific technology fostered an abundance of new inventions, constantly improving the processes of industrial production and accelerating its pace, making goods cheap and readily available. The potential danger to all human life consequent<pb n="313"/><pb n="313" type="orig"/>upon the splitting of the atom and widespread industrial degradation of the environment still lay in the future. In the nineteenth century, the energies of humanitarian reformers were focused on the unprecedented problems that attended the birth of mass society rather than on such global issues as these. Cholera, caused by contaminated drinking water, and other illnesses were associated with overcrowding. The use of industrial technology to build aqueducts, sewers, and other important elements of a new urban infrastructure was essential if populations were to survive in cities grown to a metropolitan scale. Further, parks and transportation lines connecting the commercial center with outlying residential suburbs needed to be built in order to maintain contact with nature otherwise lost to large-scale urban growth. The new immigrants pouring into cities in search of better lives posed special problems in terms of housing, education, and medical services. Responses to their suffering illuminated religion's revised role for many as an ethical, rather than a metaphysical, system.</p><p>Industrial capitalism and humane practicality went hand-in-hand. <name type="pname" target="9038">Jeremy Bentham</name> (<date when="1748">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>) and <name type="pname" target="9012">James Mill</name> (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836">1836</date>) enunciated the doctrine of utilitarianism, the ethical theory that sees utility as a measure of economic and social value, directing all action toward the goal of achieving the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Imbued with democratic principles and utilitarian concepts of social justice, civic and political leaders undertook prison and burial reform, established public education, and created cultural institutions and large municipal parks for the social improvement and recreation of the population at large.</p><p>The creation of public parks and rural cemeteries were linked nineteenth-century phenomena. The rise in the numbers of dead in growing municipalities forced speedy disinterment of bodies in order to make room for new burials. Sectarian minorities without burial grounds advocated nondenominational public cemeteries. They were joined by sanitary reformers who saw urban churchyards as a source of groundwater contamination, fostering the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases. <name type="place" target="9067" subtype="site">P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise Cemetery</name> in <name type="place">Paris</name>, established in <date when="1804">1804</date>, became an international model for municipal cemeteries elsewhere. In <name type="place">America</name>, the first public cemeteries, <name type="place">Boston</name>'s <name type="place" target="9069" subtype="site">Mount Auburn</name> and <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>'s <name type="place" target="9072" subtype="site">GreenWood</name>, served the function of public pleasure grounds in advance of the establishment of public parks, and their popularity did much to promote the municipal parks movement.</p><p>Within a repertoire of inherited design idioms featuring geometric, Picturesque, and gridiron layouts, which they often employed in combination, nineteenth-century designers strove to incorporate the newly discovered plants made available through expeditions of botanical discovery and the establishment of commercial nurseries. Through the publication of books and journals and as designers, such horticultural and landscape writers, editors, and practitioners as the Scot <name type="pname" target="7186">John Claudius Loudon</name> (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>) and the American <name type="pname" target="7169">Andrew Jackson Downing</name> (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>) democratized culture. They accomplished this by showing the aspiring members of the newly wealthy middle class how to attain the trappings of gentility, including homes and gardens similar, although on a smaller scale, to those of the aristocracy. The operative word in their works was <hi rend="italic">taste,</hi> a discerning sense of what was excellent, harmonious, and beautiful&#x2014; the quality that gave gentility visible form.</p><p>Increasingly, as living standards rose, commercial nurseries catering to the needs of the head gardeners on large estates were also able to bring horticulture within reach of other social strata. With the growth in home ownership, domesticity became a significant cultural value. The ornamental garden assumed new importance as an adjunct to the house, and even the humble cottage garden came to be regarded as an aesthetic object, rather than simply a utilitarian one. On great estates, owners ceased to remove cottages and sometimes whole villages, previously thought to blight the view of naturalistically arranged scenery. Increasingly toward the end of his career, <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name> (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818">1818</date>) had found room for vernacular architecture in his designs, and <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> now displayed the conscience of the times by illustrating his text on agrarian structures with sketches of cottages that provided both warmth and comfort for those who dwelt within and scenic charm for those who viewed them from without.</p><p>The nineteenth century signaled the separation of living space from the workplace as cottage manufacturing was replaced by industrial production in large factories. The middle-class interest in the private realm of house and garden could not have occurred without new, efficient means of public transportation after the invention of macadam paving and the railroad steam engine. These made possible the creation of residential suburbs, and landscape planners exploited this opportunity with considerable ingenuity. As the nineteenth-century metropolis became a regional-scale municipality, it encompassed its former rural environs, thereby accomplishing the ultimate ungirdling of cities and the final removal of old fortification walls.</p><p>Encouraged by <name type="pname" target="9012">Mill</name>, <name type="pname" target="9038">Bentham</name>, and the generally enterprising and practical temper of the times, people in the nineteenth century were disposed to admire utility. Although conservatives such as <name type="pname" target="7238">Ruskin</name> found the new industrial building materials hideous, others equated the useful with the beautiful. While there was debate about the siting of the new-style conservatory at the <name type="place" target="7083" subtype="site">Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew</name> within the principal line of view, the technological ingenuity of its architecture was in fact a source of pride, and its immediate popularity justified its conspicuous location (see fig. 9.4). People soon attuned their eyes to the novel form and materials of such great glass structures, engineered to span unprecedented widths, and they became architectural icons of the age, employed in the construction of railroad stations and in the <name type="place" target="9000" subtype="site">Crystal Palace of the Great Exposition</name> held in <name type="place">London</name> in <date when="1851">1851</date>, followed by one built in <name type="place">New York City</name> two years later.</p><p>In other ways, technology played an important role in landscape design. The lawn mower was patented by <name type="pname" target="9014">Edwin Budding</name> in <date when="1830">1830</date>. This efficient machine made possible a landscape aesthetic that put a premium upon the smooth, evenly sheared lawn as scythe mowing was abandoned (see fig. 9.6). The coming of railroads not only created the planned suburb, but brought quickly and cheaply nonlocal building materials and horticultural plants to urban centers. Innovations multiplied as inventors took out patents on a host of new materials: portland cement, asphalt paving, the wrought<pb n="314"/><pb n="314" type="orig"/>iron sash bar for conservatory panes, sheet glass. Cast-iron construction, the revival of terra-cotta casting, and the manufacture of encaustic tiles increased the range of opportunity for ornamental expression. Steam, hot-water, and eventually gas heating systems provided comfort and convenience to people and protected tender plants. Applications of technology to the built environment had important effects on landscape design and the appearance of cities.</p><p>Increasingly, the garden became the laboratory of horticultural science. Not only were exotic species displayed as choice specimens of garden art, but also grafting, training, and hybridization produced plants in new forms, shapes, and colors. Competitive exhibitions such as the <name type="place" target="7003" subtype="site">Chiswick Show</name> were organized to judge their merits. Commercial nurseries thrived as botanical interest became widespread.</p><p>Garden encyclopedias replaced treatises on aesthetics. Numerous periodicals sprang up to serve an audience eager for advice on the practical aspects of landscape design and information about the latest developments in botany and horticulture. Horticultural societies, botanical gardens, and certain wealthy persons continued to send plant explorers to remote parts of the globe in search of uncatalogued species. Botanical illustration reached its apogee as an art form, and many beautiful colored engravings by such talented artists as <name type="pname" target="9015">Pierre-Joseph Redout&#x00E9;</name> (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841">1841</date>), <name type="pname" target="9017">Francis Bauer</name> (<date when="1758">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840">1840</date>) and <name type="pname" target="9018">Ferdinand Bauer</name> (<date when="1760">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), and <name type="pname" target="9036">James Sowerby</name> (<date when="1757">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">1822</date>) were reproduced in the proliferating horticultural magazines (see fig. 9.1). Some of their names&#x2014;<hi rend="italic" target="9053">The Botanic Garden</hi>, <hi rend="italic" target="9009">Botanical Magazine or Flower-Garden Displayed</hi>, <hi rend="italic" target="9024">Gardeners' Magazine of Botany</hi>, <hi rend="italic" target="9045">Paxton's Magazine of Botany and Register of Flowering Plants</hi>, <hi rend="italic" target="9031">Horticultural Journal and Florists' Register of Useful Information Connected with Floriculture</hi>, <hi rend="italic" target="9057">The Floricultural Cabinet</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Florists'Magazine</hi>&#x2014; suggest the nineteenth century's fascination with flowers newly available to gardeners through the efforts of ingenious hybridizers and intrepid explorers.</p><p>The competition among these periodicals in a time when literary piracy and plagiarism were common generated considerable editorial invective. The passions that ran high in their pages were symptomatic of an intense and broadening interest in horticulture and landscape design. In <hi rend="italic" target="9023">Gardener's Magazine, and Register of Rural and Domestic Improvement</hi>, the earliest general horticultural publication, <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> forthrightly delivered his candid opinions between <date when="1826">1826</date> and <date when="1844">1844</date>. As we shall see in Chapter Eleven, by the end of the century, after the Victorian garden had incorporated the botanical riches of the age, new design wars erupted in <name type="place">England</name>, pitting advocates of informal impressionistic arrangement of herbaceous borders, such as the horticultural writer and editor <name type="pname" target="9020">William Robinson</name> and the Arts and Crafts gardener, photographer, and author <name type="pname" target="7094">Gertrude Jekyll</name>, against those who practiced "bedding out," the arrangement of plants according to precise patterns for seasonal display. At the same time, <name type="pname" target="9022">Sir Reginald Blomfield</name> championed Italianate geometrical style in <hi rend="italic" target="9058">The Formal Garden in England</hi> (<date when="1892">1892</date>), fiercely opposing <name type="pname" target="9020">Robinson</name>'s naturalistic approach. Thus was the debate between Art and Nature once again joined within the context of landscape design.</p><p>The rapidly industrializing cities of the northeastern United States looked to <name type="place">England</name> for landscape design models at the same time as the American frontier was being pushed westward. The street grid proved the most practical means for parceling and conveying real estate in new cities, but preceptors such as <name type="pname" target="7169">Andrew Jackson Downing</name>, who instructed the growing middle class in the principles of horticultural management and Picturesque landscape design, began to pose an alternative. <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> gave the term <hi rend="italic">rural</hi> new meaning by creating a middle landscape of suburban "villa" and cottage architecture&#x2014;a built landscape that was neither wholly agrarian nor wholly urban.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7087">Frederick Law Olmsted</name> (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903">1903</date>), in partnership with the English-born architect <name type="pname" target="7187">Calvert Vaux</name> (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">1895</date>), directed the Picturesque idiom toward democratic ends in creating America's first public parks. The parks that <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> designed, first in <name type="place">New York</name> and then in other cities, were mostly naturalistic essays in which they replicated rural and wilderness scenery in order to create a poetic mood that would lift the spirits of careworn city dwellers. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> also became the country's first urban planners on a metropolitan scale, conceiving of parkways as a means of linking parks together into a citywide system and providing carriage drives to America's first suburbs. The curvilinear layout of the suburbs they designed posed a Picturesque alternative to the grid, heretofore the standard plan for new streets. Still other forces at the end of the nineteenth century set the country on a different course, as the designers for a Gilded Age imitated the historic architecture and planning forms of Renaissance and seventeenth-century <name type="place">France</name> and <name type="place">Italy</name>.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Indefatigable</hi> and <hi rend="italic">industrious</hi> are adjectives often connected with the names of many nineteenth-century figures. Herculean were the labors of those who created the botanical gardens and other scientific and cultural institutions, meticulously recorded the observations of their difficult voyages to distant parts, built the parks and park systems that we still enjoy, and conceived and built the transportation and sanitary engineering infrastructure to support large cities&#x2014;all the while corresponding voluminously and publishing profusely without the convenience of present-day communications technology. Our chronicle of the period begins with a discussion of the careers of several important figures who personify the human energy that flourished spectacularly at this time.</p><div type="section"><pb n="315"/><pb n="315" type="orig"/><head><hi rend="bold">I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Botanical Science, the Gardenesque Style, and People's Parks: Landscape Design in Victorian England</hi></hi></head><p>Eighteenth-century Enlightenment science opened the door to the passionate pursuit of natural history in the nineteenth century. The real "discovery" of <name type="place">America</name> had been the discovery by Europeans of unbounded economic opportunity, a good deal of which was based at first on a single plant, tobacco. A happy bonus had been the introduction to botanical science of a wealth of hitherto unknown ornamental species. The plant exchanges that occurred first in the colonial era and then in the federal period prepared the way for the explosion of horticultural activity in the nineteenth century. The taxonomic classification system developed by <name type="pname" target="7241">Linnaeus</name>, in which Latin provided a universal language of binomial references for individual plant species, made it possible for members of a growing international scientific community to develop a common knowledge base and communicate intelligibly with one another.</p><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="place" target="7083" subtype="site">The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew</name></hi></hi></head><p>At the center of much of this botanical activity and forming the bridge between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries stood <name type="pname" target="9027">Sir Joseph Banks</name> (<date when="1743">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">1820</date>), the president of the <name type="pname" target="7225">Royal Society</name> from <date when="1778">1778</date> until his death and, as botanical advisor to <name type="pname" target="9028">George III</name>, de facto director of the <name type="place" target="7083" subtype="site">Royal Gardens at Kew</name>. Wealthy, politically well-connected, and with three years of experience collecting plants on the <hi rend="italic">Endeavour</hi> voyage as credentials for projects of this nature, <name type="pname" target="9027">Banks</name> was able to attract royal and aristocratic patronage for naturalists attached to ships bound for distant lands. He assessed the professional skills and industriousness of young men in training at <name type="place" target="7083" subtype="site">Kew</name>, and from their ranks selected candidates such as <name type="pname" target="9031">Allan Cunningham</name> and <name type="pname" target="9030">James Bowie</name> for the arduous work of plant hunting in the wilds of <name type="place">South Africa</name>, <name type="place">Australia</name>, the <name type="place">Americas</name>, and <name type="place">China</name>. <name type="pname" target="9027">Banks</name> enjoined these and other explorers to keep journals recording the climatic conditions and soil quality of native plant habitats.

After burying a chrysalis in soil placed in the bottom of a covered glass jar, he soon discovered that the seeds in the soil began to germinate because condensation produced by plant respiration within the jar created a moist, self-sustaining environment.

His farm roads followed the contours of the land in a Picturesque manner, and around his new house he planted shrubs and trees in irregular masses, once again according to the system of <name type="pname" target="9040">Jussieu</name>. Although he did not coin the term <hi rend="italic">Gardenesque</hi> until twenty years later, here he put into practice the principles of his later definition by incorporating exotic species into his landscape design and displaying all plants, whether foreign or native, in such a way that each could reveal itself to advantage. Botanical display was a central focus for <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> and his intention at <name type="place" target="9003" subtype="site">Tew Lodge Farm</name> and elsewhere was to acknowledge landscape as nature, art, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> science.</p><p>From the beginning of his career, <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> saw education as one of his missions.

Letters of introduction from <name type="pname" target="9027">Sir Joseph Banks</name> gained him access to aristocratic estates and professional societies where his knowledge of French, German, and Italian made it possible for him to speak fluently with head gardeners, architects, and others. In Russia, he was impressed with the pineapples, cherries, peaches, plums, apples, pears, and grapes that were being grown under glass on noblemen's estates. It was with a technical eye that he studied the construction of greenhouses or remarked on the heat-retention capabilities of the Russian stove. These observations served him well when, upon returning to <name type="place">London</name>, he turned his thoughts toward an examination of how the construction of greenhouses could be improved through technology.</p><p>In this effort he was not alone.

Conservatories at this time were still being designed in the tradition represented by <name type="pname" target="7077">Chambers</name>'s <name type="place" target="9004" subtype="subsite">Orangery</name> at <name type="place" target="7083" subtype="site">Kew</name>, with large arched windows set into masonry walls.

His experiments also led him to propose a "ridge and furrow," or double-meridian, glazing system in which the glass panes of the conservatory were angled so as best to catch morning and afternoon light while preventing the scorching of leaves by the direct rays ot the noonday sun. He also conceived a "polyprosopic design of hinged surfaces that could be adjusted by chains and pulleys in the manner of Venetian blinds to gain a more desirable angle in relation to the sun or to let in fresh air and summer rain showers (fig. 9.3).

But commissions, especially those that served a public interest, were an important means of demonstrating the principles and practices he advocated in his books and magazines. He was therefore delighted to be summoned to the industrial town of <name type="place">Derby</name> in the spring of <date when="1839">1839</date> to lay out an 11-acre arboretum, the gift to the town from its former mayor, <name type="pname" target="9047">Joseph Strutt</name>.

But as a social experiment, it was an unqualified success. Three days of public revels attended its opening, and according to contemporary reports not a single plant was harmed. It remained a popular attraction, drawing on Sundays throngs of working-class people, some of whom traveled in the third-class railway carriages from as far away as <name type="place">Sheffield</name>, <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, and <name type="place">Leeds</name>. When they arrived, they could refresh themselves at the entry lodge, where there were toilet facilities and hot water for tea.

Those who preferred simple relaxation to botanical edification could walk on one of the two broad, straight gravel paths that constituted the Arboretum's cross axis. Pavilions at the ends of the crosswalks provided shade or shelter from a shower. Benches, with footboards as an accommodation to the aged and infirm, offered seating along the paths. Altogether, the <name type="place" target="9009" subtype="site">Derby Arboretum</name> was an impressive and progressive accomplishment in <date when="1840">1840</date>, a forerunner of the work of <name type="pname" target="9041">Joseph Paxton</name>, <name type="pname" target="7087">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, and other later park builders.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>'s marriage at the age of forty-seven to <name type="pname" target="9048">Jane Webb</name> (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>) was rewarding for both partners.

Combined with expression of the Romantic spirit of the age was a bent toward practicality and desire to employ industrial materials that anticipated the functional landscape aesthetic of twentieth-century modernism (see Chapter Thirteen). But unlike modernist designers who sought to elevate functionalism to the status of aesthetic principle, Victorian landscape gardeners were unreservedly eclectic. They cloaked their functionalism in period costume&#x2014;"the Styles that <name type="pname" target="9056">Le Corbusier</name> as a polemical modernist would famously rail against. The search for cultural coherence where none could be found in the face of society's growing secularism and rapid technological change fostered this historicism. People who cared about such things looked nostalgically to the architectural vocabularies of other times and places as embodiments of various truer meanings than what they believed existed in nineteenth-century <name type="place">England</name>. Followers of <name type="pname" target="7238">John Ruskin</name>, for instance, developed the Victorian Gothic style with its evocation of medieval Christian values. Other Victorians, ambitious for Britain's growing imperial power, favored Neoclassical design idioms based on French and Italian models as appropriate means of advertising wealth and status. Imitations of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> beds found in seventeenth-century <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teaux</hi> gardens proved admirably suited to their lavish, patterned floral displays.</p><p>Even such a prominent practitioner of the Picturesque as <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name> modified his style at the end of his career to reflect a greater tolerance for period elements, such as terraces with balustrades. With practical considerations in mind, he abandoned the illusionary technique of the ha-ha with which he had, following <name type="pname" target="7008">Brown</name>, fostered an impression of unbroken rural scenery extending from distant pastures to the walls of the mansion. He even designed Gardenesque flower beds in its immediate environs (see fig. 7.25). <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name>'s collected works, thanks to the <date when="1840">1840</date> edition edited by <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>, were now a ready reference for those who came to feel that the eighteenth century approach to the Picturesque had been overly zealous in its eradication of traditional forms. Even <name type="pname" target="7091">Price</name> regretted having removed the terraces of his country house, <name type="place" target="9010" subtype="site">Foxley</name>, in his youth.

The head gardeners, who commanded these workers while attending and informing the landscaping tastes of their lordly masters, became important purveyors of the several Victorian garden styles as the trend toward imaginative historicizing brought several older design vocabularies&#x2014;-Jacobean English, Renaissance Italian, and seventeenth-century French and Dutch&#x2014;back into vogue. With this labor force and with railroad transportation to deliver materials from afar, including huge boulders for the rock gardens that became fashionable at this time, dukes and earls vied in the creation of gardens where spectacular effects and horticultural virtuosity were important ends.</p><figure xml:id="fig-381"><graphic url="CH9_009.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">Below:</hi> 9.8. <name type="place" target="9012" subtype="site">Levens Hall, Westmorland</name>, Topiary Garden, created c. <date when="1700">1700</date>; restored and maintained by head gardener <name type="pname" target="9061">Alexander Forbes</name>, active <date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;62</hi></figDesc></figure><p><name type="pname" target="9050">William Barron</name> (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>), the head gardener to the earls of Harrington at <name type="place" target="9013" subtype="site">Elvaston Castle</name> in <name type="place">Derbyshire</name>, achieved renown for his tree-transplanting expertise and for creating a famous topiary garden.

Color theory became one of the head gardener's job requirements. Not only did carpet beds&#x2014; mosaiclike seasonal display beds&#x2014;have to be designed for similarity of flower height and simultaneity of bloom, but they also had to be laid out according to artistic principles dictating the juxtaposition of solid floral masses of contrasting and complementary rather than similar tones.</p><p>The challenge facing nineteenth-century designers was how to assemble all of these interesting, useful, and charming objects&#x2014;botanical specimens, historical ruins, glasshouses and summerhouses, rock gardens and kitchen gardens, flowers and fountains&#x2014;within a coherent framework. <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>'s designs owed their coherence to what he called the axis of symmetry. As he explained it:<q>In the simplest kind of symmetry, the two sides are equal and alike, and the axis is, of course, easily discovered; but in cultivated and refined symmetry, the sides are unequal, and so combined and varied with the centre, that it requires the eye of a philosophical artist to detect the axis.<ref target="#CH9-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></q></p><p>Thus, <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> sought a sense of balance, not a mirror imaging of parts, and his axes were not necessarily visible, but sometimes merely implied. With the axis of symmetry as an organizing principle, he arranged garden features and vegetation in various ways to produce a balanced effect.</p><p>Design harmony could also be achieved through congruity. Congruity meant respecting the character of the existing landscape as much as the abilities of the gardener, choosing local stones for boulders in rock gardens, placing water bodies in lowlying areas where they would naturally be found, banning sculpture and architecture of a purely associative nature, avoiding discordant juxtapositions in the arrangement of exotic plants, and developing zones of transition between distinctly different parts of the garden, as for instance the area between a smooth lawn and a rock garden.</p><figure xml:id="fig-383"><graphic url="CH9_011.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">Below:</hi> 9.10.

The son of a farmer, <name type="pname" target="9041">Paxton</name> worked as a gardening hand in his youth before going to <name type="place">London</name> at the age of twenty.

The subsequent flowering of <name type="pname" target="9041">Paxton</name>'s genius, combined with the duke's largess, soon made <name type="place" target="9005" subtype="site">Chatsworth</name> a seat of horticultural renown.

He did not, however, re-create the setting of the original as it appeared in the late seventeenth century, designing instead a woodland glen and rockworks as a naturalistic environment for this surprising hydrological feature. <name type="pname" target="9041">Paxton</name>'s mature landscape style continued to be characterized by the same independence from aesthetic theory and easy synthesis of artificial and natural.</p><figure xml:id="fig-384"><graphic url="CH9_012.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.11. <name type="place" target="9018" subtype="subsite">Emperor Fountain, Chatsworth</name>, Derbyshire, designed by <name type="pname" target="9041">Joseph Paxton</name>. <date when="1843">1843</date></hi></figDesc></figure><p>His on-site education in landscape design history occurred in the <date when="1830">1830</date>s as he accompanied the duke of Devonshire on tours of Versailles and other gardens near <name type="place">Paris</name>, the gardens of <name type="place">England</name>, and Italian villa gardens.

Their dredging spoil was used to construct rocky berms that varied the topography and restricted the view lines, thereby creating a more intimate lakeside environment. Further, <name type="pname" target="9041">Paxton</name> designed an independent path system for strolling through this landscape separate from that of the macadamized circuit drive, which was intended for carriages.</p><p>From their inception, parks were popular venues for sports as well as places for leisurely strolling in scenic surroundings. This caused difficulty for landscape designers like <name type="pname" target="9041">Paxton</name>, whose bias was to exploit the scenic potential of the site, as well as for administrators and park managers, who were often forced to modify original designs to accept a variety of play facilities and who had to write regulations and deal with the consequences of sports use on the landscape.

Although there are trenchant observations of all these things, his work is, as its title suggests, a political treatise. As such, it was not designed merely to limn the national character of the Americans as a simple narrative of their manners, mores, and economic circumstances would have done. Instead, its purpose was to foretell the consequences of the profound social transformation then in progress as the nations of Europe passed from aristocratic to democratic governance.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> had read the second volume of <hi rend="italic" target="9010">Democracy in America</hi> as it rolled off the presses in <date when="1840">1840</date> His job, as he saw it, was to counter the restless instability of his fellow citizens that <name type="pname" target="9085">Tocqueville</name> had noted with visions of home as a cherished domain and place of charm. He wished to educate their taste, which would then make manifest republican virtue in the nation's landscape. He hoped that through a new vision of domestic comfort and refinement the "moderate amount of happiness" available to all men in a democratic society might be attained. His idealistic prescriptions were overrun during the post&#x2014;Civil War transformation of American capitalist culture into something that more closely resembled the class stratification evident in the nations of Europe. But during his lifetime, he securely occupied the middle ground between <name type="pname" target="7009">Jefferson</name>'s Federalist generation&#x2014;whose democratic principles were compromised by patrician values&#x2014;and the generation of opulent materialistic display that gave the "villas" and "cottages" he promoted a new scale and meaning. <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> was, in short, a champion of the middle class, and he held a strong faith in the ability of education to raise people, if not to economic equality, at least to a sentimental equality in their appreciation and enjoyment of beauty.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> occupied the middle ground in a literal sense. Deploring both the rude, ax-scarred utilitarian landscapes that were a product of a frontier mentality and the cramped insalubrious atmosphere of the noisy commercial and industrial cities, he implied in his use of the word <hi rend="italic">rural</hi> the concept of the suburb. To the freestanding middle-class dwelling and its adjacent grounds, and even the humble workingclass dwelling with its surrounding small plot of land, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> directed owners and landlords to pay the same prideful attention as that lavished by the wealthy on their country seats. He saw these homes, outside but accessible to urban centers by new means of transportation, as part of a larger, inherently Picturesque American landscape, and he believed that if his architectural and landscaping recommendations were followed, residents of this middle ground would be making a patriotic contribution to the nation's overall beauty while increasing their own personal comfort and enjoyment.</p><p>His congenial mind did not reckon that rural privacy might become retreat from community. A product of the American rural town, as a professional horticulturist and citizen, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> promoted village beautification by tree planting. More important, he did not ignore the city. His reformer's cry, more ardent than any other's, championed the public park as the fundamental civilizing institution of American democracy in the <date when="1840">1840</date>s.</p><pb n="327"/><pb n="327" type="orig"/><p><name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> illustrated an aspect of American life shrewdly observed by <name type="pname" target="9085">Tocqueville</name>: citizen initiative. There was no higher authority than the people in a democracy, so there were no <hi rend="italic">royal</hi> academies. Public libraries, colleges, lyceums, museums of art and natural history, botanical gardens, horticultural societies, rural cemeteries, and public parks&#x2014;all these educational and cultural institutions were founded by the vision of individuals, the action of community organizers, and the will of legislators who were elected by the people. <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>'s role as citizen advocate and spokesman within this context was an especially important one.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>, the youngest son of a nurseryman in Newburgh, <name type="place">New York</name>, was a self-taught botanist and student of the Picturesque. After his marriage at age twenty-three to <name type="pname" target="9076">Caroline DeWint</name> of <name type="place">Fishkill Landing</name>, he designed and built a home on the family property in <name type="place" target="9037" subtype="site">Newburgh</name> (fig. 9.16). This house and its grounds epitomized the life of rural refinement he wished for all Americans of moderate affluence. It represented as well his belief that as <name type="place">America</name> came of age, its rootless, restlessly moving people should sink down roots, beautify their properties, and build communities that were more than commercial crossroads. Although similar to buildings in the "pointed" style recommended by <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>'s home had a particularly American feature&#x2014;the veranda, or piazza, as contemporaries called it&#x2014;which <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> promoted throughout his career in even his humblest samples of domestic architecture.</p><p>Thus situated, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> could enjoy the commercial advantages of bustling Newburgh and the lively social intercourse made possible by the arrival at the town landing of friends traveling by river sloop and steamboat or at his door via train and carriage. He was within an easy three-hour train ride to <name type="place">New York</name> City, where he met with his publisher or conducted other business. At the same time, he could preserve the illusion of living in nature, never having to see town or road, only foliage-framed views of Hudson River scenery. In attempting to come to terms with the nineteenth-century phenomenon of rapid metropolitan growth, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> was perhaps unwilling to admit the degree to which the agricultural economy of the young republic was being rapidly superseded by an industrial one. For this reason he used the word <hi rend="italic">rural</hi> to denote his vision of the <hi rend="italic">sub</hi>urban landscape that constituted the middle ground between city dwelling, with its noise, congestion, and extremes of wealth and poverty, and the equally unappealing alternative of hardscrabble farm life.</p><figure xml:id="fig-389"><graphic url="CH9_017.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.16.

Husbandry combined with taste could capitalize upon <name type="place">America</name>'s natural beauty, turning the countryside into a collage of Picturesque scenery. But opposing forces were at work, and the discordant aspects of the American dream&#x2014;the industrial smokestacks of the city and the train tracks running beside the river&#x2014;had to be screened from view, if the pastoral imagery of the garden were to appear intact. In nineteenth-century <name type="place">America</name>, as in <name type="place">England</name>, ambivalence about the Industrial Age was expressed by placing utilitarian technology and a highly eclectic architectural vocabulary of period styles within the same cultural embrace. <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> may have shared with others of his generation a sense of anxiety as the machinery of capitalism focused its energies on enterprises that would eventually destroy much of the picturesque character of aspiring rural towns, elm-canopied village greens, well-tended fields, and rich pastures fringed with woods. Nevertheless, as a reformer, a republican idealist, and a progressive Anglophile, he necessarily accepted both the democratic, technological future and the tradition-rooted, agrarian past. Whatever fears he may have harbored, he did not reveal them but optimistically projected a vision of universal betterment through the agency of good design.</p><figure xml:id="fig-390"><graphic url="CH9_018.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.17 and 9.18.

Here, in an editorial he wrote each month, he propounded his landscape theories; shared observations gleaned from his travels; gave advice on rural architecture, transplanting trees, growing hedges, enriching soil, manuring orchards, improving vegetables, and producing wine; mingled poetry and instruction in a rhapsody on roses; provided detailed instruction on the building of greenhouses and ice houses; argued the case&#x2014;exercise, fresh air, health&#x2014;for women to garden; and sermonized on the mistakes of city folk new to country life&#x2014;all in a conversational voice and anecdotal style that endeared him to his readers. <hi rend="italic" target="9063">The Horticulturist</hi> reached a large audience.

His vision for the new park was equally bold in its outlines. Not only would it have carriage drives, bridle trails, secluded walks, and "a real feeling of the breadth and beauty of green fields," but it would also be a place for commemorative statues, a winter garden like the Crystal Palace "where the whole people could luxuriate in groves of the palms and spice trees of the tropics, at the same moment that sleighing parties glided swiftly and noiselessly over the snowcovered surface of the country-like avenues of the wintry park without." Zoological gardens would also find a home there, as would spacious buildings for expositions of the arts. Above all, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> extolled the social implications of the proposal.

Socially conscious tastemakers such as <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> and <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> were important precisely because the city itself was becoming a far-flung middle-class institution. As <name type="place">London</name> had already demonstrated a century earlier, the city and the private estates that were its rural outposts, not the court, determined culture, and the bourgeoisie who were now primary cultural consumers welcomed the reformers' advice that refined them and elevated them above those less fortunate.</p><p>Although <name type="place">Italy</name> and <name type="place">Germany</name> were slow to become unified states, the trend toward nationalism had been set in motion, and bonds of cultural commonalty among their respective principalities, dukedoms, and city-states were reinforced through language, art, trade, and travel as well as by military alliance. The growth in nationalistic spirit paralleled the growth in importance and size of urban centers. With the diminution of the power of kingship, of the prestige of the Church, and of the wealth of aristocracy, the monuments that had once broadcast the supremacy of these institutions lost meaning. As societies rebuilt themselves along more democratic and sectarian lines, they felt compelled to create images of <hi rend="italic">constitutional</hi> monarchs, revolutionary heroes, and the honored dead as icons of national status and civic pride, replacing older monuments of kings and religious figures.</p><div type="subsection"><pb n="331"/><pb n="331" type="orig"/><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Commemorative Landscape</hi></hi></head><p>Commemorating national heroes assumed importance as nineteenth-century nations sought to institutionalize recently formed governments or cloak their military adventures abroad in a mantle of imperial glory by celebrating them in a public and permanent manner.

Added to this cultural imperative was the public health motive, about which there was much debate, for the crowding that accompanied population increases in nineteenth-century cities was noticeable not only in the festering urban slums, but also in the churchyard cemeteries that were filled to capacity so that corpses were periodically exhumed to make room for new ones. The resulting stench of putrefying flesh caused passersby to hold their noses as physicians argued inconclusively over whether "miasmas" from decaying animal matter bred disease.</p><p>The notion of a permanent resting place where the dead could be visited by the living and remembered individually did not accord with either Catholic or Calvinist belief. Both held that mortal flesh, even in life, was corrupt and an encumbrance to the spirit, which, freed of mortality, could join God. Viewed in this light, the collective sight of the dead served as a reminder of the transitory nature of earthly life and a warning against vanity and pride. The equation of the afterlife with an Edenic gardenlike paradise did not figure in pre-nineteenth-century Western theology, and tree planting in cemeteries was considered an encouragement of latent tendencies toward pantheism, which priests and ministers wanted to stamp out. Not the living tree but the death mask was depicted on Puritan tombstones in <name type="place">New England</name> graveyards: this <hi rend="italic">memento mori</hi> was meant to discourage worldly ambition and individualism. Only with the decline of Puritanism did the symbolism of vegetative endurance and cyclical rebirth manifest itself in the substitution of the sweetly melancholy willow-tree-and-urn motif, also found in mourning pictures, for the death mask on some slab gravestones (fig. 9.24).</p><p>The creation of the extramural "rural" cemetery demanded a significant change in societal values involving the secularization of death and the granting of dignity to the individual life as well as the right to associative sentiment on the part of families and friends. In the aftermath of <name type="place">London</name>'s Great Fire of <date when="1666">1666</date>, both <name type="pname" target="7030">John Evelyn</name> and <name type="pname" target="9121">Christopher Wren</name> had urged the discontinuance of churchyard burial, and the eighteenth-century Whig garden, replete with emblems of commemoration, offered an important prototype for the cemetery amid shady groves. <name type="pname" target="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s Romantic poetry evoked a mood of elegiac remembrance in images of country graveyards, while in a prose essay he instructed that "when<pb n="333"/><pb n="333" type="orig"/>death is in our thoughts, nothing can make amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature, and for the absence of those types of renovation and decay, which the fields and woods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind."<ref target="#CH9-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref></p><p>It was not in <name type="place">England</name> but in <name type="place">France</name>, however, that the first metropolitan rural cemetery came into being. There, the post-Revolutionary invention of new institutions to replace discredited old ones and the growing fashion (initiated by <name type="pname" target="7006">Rousseau</name>'s tomb at <name type="place" target="7000" subtype="site">Ermenonville</name>) for memorials set in nature provided the impetus for a change in burial customs. In addition, new scientific theories of photosynthesis supported the practice of tree planting as conducive to urban health, and people began to desire the sight of cemeteries with grass lawns rather than bare earth. Historic preservation also played a role in those turbulent times when many royal monuments had been recently removed from churches and public places. Preservationists such as <name type="pname" target="9122">Antoine-Chrysostome Quatrem&#x00E8;re de Quincy</name> argued for incorporating the salvage into cemeteries as proud relics of French cultural heritage. In <date when="1796">1796</date>, the <name type="pname" target="9231">National Institute of Sciences and Arts</name> called for papers on new customs and sites for burying the dead. In his prizewinning essay, the classical scholar <name type="pname" target="9123">Amaury Duval</name> evoked the custom of antiquity as precedent for extramural burial, for in ancient Athens burial of notables took place in the <name type="place" target="9063" subtype="site">Kerameikos</name>, the pottery-making district outside the <name type="place" target="9064" subtype="site">Dipylon Gate</name>, and in ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> the dead of prominent families were laid to rest in tombs along the <name type="place" target="9065" subtype="site">Appian Way</name>. He declared that for himself, he wished a grave in nature like <name type="pname" target="7006">Rousseau</name>'s.</p><p>The argument was echoed by others. There were proposals for the burial on private property of those, such as farmers, who owned land, and for those who did not, the authorities were encouraged to set aside dignified public burial grounds outside the city where family tombs would receive the remains of the departed, which would no longer be placed anonymously in common graves. In <date when="1801">1801</date>, legislation was passed authorizing the communes of <name type="place">France</name> to purchase land outside their boundaries for public cemeteries, and two years later the <name type="pname" target="9246">Department of the Seine</name> created the first one on a high escarpment near the eastern edge of <name type="place">Paris</name>. Known as the <name type="place" target="9066" subtype="site">Cemetery of the East</name> but called <name type="place" target="9067" subtype="site">P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise</name> after the Jesuit priest <name type="pname" target="9124">P&#x00E8;re François de La Chaise</name>, <name type="pname" target="7160">Louis XIV</name>'s confessor, who had once owned the land, it was laid out according to a plan developed by the architect <name type="pname" target="9125">AlexandreTh&#x00E9;odore Brongniart</name> (<date when="1739">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813">1813</date>) in a manner that combined axial geometry and monumental focal points with the picturesqueness of a serpentine circuit path and naturalistic plantings. A central <hi rend="italic">tapis vert</hi> led the visitor to the site of a chapel, designed as an Egyptian pyramid, which was never built because work was halted by the Napoleonic wars. To the left of this greensward axis were the plots reserved as grave sites for the masses, where five-year and tenyear leaseholds replaced the common burial pits of former times. On the higher terrain was institutionalized the concept of freehold ownership in perpetuity for families who wished to purchase plots.</p><figure xml:id="fig-397"><graphic url="CH9_025.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.25 and 9.26.<name type="place" target="9067" subtype="site"> P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise Cemetery</name></hi></figDesc></figure><figure xml:id="fig-398"><graphic url="CH9_026.jpg"/></figure><p>Although common folk immediately began to bury their dead in the leasehold area, the sale of the perpetual plots was slow at first, gathering momentum after monuments purporting to be the tombs of <name type="pname" target="9094">Ab&#x00E9;lard</name> and <name type="pname" target="9095">H&#x00E9;loise</name>, <name type="pname" target="9096">Moli&#x00E8;re</name>, and <name type="pname" target="9097">La Fontaine</name> were installed and then joined by the actual ones of such contemporary celebrities as <name type="pname" target="9098">Fr&#x00E9;d&#x00E9;ric Chopin</name>.

They, too, wanted to create cemeteries that honored their brief national history, dignified the dead, and consoled the living. Their means of achieving this end was not by government decree as in <name type="place">France</name> but, in a tradition <name type="pname" target="9085">Tocqueville</name> recognized, through voluntary associations of citizen-reformers, who in this case developed a vision, enlisted support, formed a corporation, and sold burial plots.</p><p>Many people at the time resisted the placement of the dead outside town boundaries, inasmuch as maurading wolves were a still-recent menace and burial within insecure extramural precincts would facilitate the work of "resurrection men" who harvested corpses for medical dissection.

The American poet <name type="pname" target="9127">William Cullen Bryant</name> (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">1878</date>), along with <name type="pname" target="7011">Wordsworth</name>, touched a responsive chord in the breasts of New Englanders such as <name type="pname" target="9100">Bigelow</name> and <name type="pname" target="9117">Dearborn</name>, for whom the word <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi> denoted the manly emotion of remembrance with pleasurable melancholy, not maudlin excess, in a period when many fathers mourned the death of young wives and children. <name type="pname" target="9127">Bryant</name>'s most famous poem, "Thanatopsis" (<date when="1817">1817</date>), gave voice to <name type="pname" target="9100">Bigelow</name>'s medically and horticulturally informed opinion that the rapid dissolution of the uncoffined body laid to rest in nature constituted a sweet surrender of individual existence. At the same time, memory of the individual life lived within the bosom of family and community would be honored in epitaphs inscribed on monuments, and these would inspire others to lives of goodness and achievement.</p><p>The site for the new cemetery was secured in <date when="1830">1830</date> when another proponent, <name type="pname" target="9101">George Watson Brimmer</name>, sold to the <name type="pname" target="9229">Massachusetts Horticultural Society</name> a particularly beautiful piece of property consisting of 72 acres of heavily wooded, hilly terrain, the characteristic <name type="place">New England</name> landscape of drumlins&#x2014; ridges deposited by successive epochs of glaciation &#x2014;and bogs, and ponds left in the wake of the retreating ice. Poetically inclined Harvard students, who liked to frequent this naturally picturesque spot of bosky dells, grassy knolls, and an abandoned colonial farmstead, called it Sweet Auburn after a vanished English hamlet destroyed by the enclosure movement, which <name type="pname" target="9055">Oliver Goldsmith</name> had lamented in his poem "The Deserted Village" (<date when="1770">1770</date>).

This horticultural component was integral to his broad vision, as was the notion of creating a studio school on the premises for the instruction of professional landscape designers.</p><p>The author of a two-volume treatise on Greek architecture, <name type="pname" target="9117">Dearborn</name> now sought to develop siting opportunities for the monuments that would make <name type="place" target="9069" subtype="site">Mount Auburn</name> an American version of <name type="place" target="7001" subtype="site">Stowe</name> or <name type="place" target="7005" subtype="site">Stourhead</name> (see Chapter Seven).

The obelisk, appropriated by ancient <name type="place">Rome</name> as a trophy of conquest and converted by Renaissance city planners and garden builders into a widely copied landscape feature, connoted both timelessness and the death-embracing culture of ancient <name type="place">Egypt</name>. Somewhat miniaturized, obelisks were frequently employed in eighteenth-century English gardens as memorials to cultural and political heroes.

Within the romantically Picturesque landscape, they act as poetic accents. The atmosphere of<pb n="336"/><pb n="336" type="orig"/>a forest glen is intentional. In the early years of the cemetery's existence, in keeping with the founders desires to retain as much as possible the inherent charms of the site, maintenance was limited to keeping gravel paths accessible; only in the second half of the nineteenth century did the cemetery assume a parklike aspect. Also evident is <name type="place" target="9069" subtype="site">Mount Auburn</name>'s intended function as a didactic landscape, a place of moral instruction, for the engravings show parents with young children in tow as well as solitary figures meditating in its sweetly melancholy gloom. The cemetery's purpose as a contemplative landscape was underlined by the publication of visitors' guides with brief, inspiring biographies of the distinguished dead. In spite of its role in expressing community values and community pride, the plots were private property, and the proprietors not only erected monuments&#x2014;often in anticipation of their deaths&#x2014;to function as future genealogies in stone, but they also fenced their places of perpetual rest with handsome cast-iron fences.</p><figure xml:id="fig-401"><graphic url="CH9_029.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.29.

Some chamber tombs were nestled into hillsides and faced with granite after stonecutters perfected techniques for carving and incising this durable material (fig. 9.31).

By this time, mnemonic devices and landscapes evoking the past were less compelling to a new generation of Americans more interested in progress than in the past. Idealization of republican virtue and the domestication of death seemed less important after the Civil War than materialistic success and optimistic faith in the future. The notion of history as continuous linear improvement that many Americans came to identify with their nation's peculiar destiny fostered an attitude of denial toward death and an aversion to reminders of human mortality and the decline of civilizations. By contrast, the founders of <name type="place" target="9069" subtype="site">Mount Auburn</name> held that history was cyclical, believing that the young republic they were shaping would one day, like <name type="place">Rome</name>, fall into ruin. Their elegiac monuments were meant for future generations to read as a testament to the greatness of the republican experiment in <name type="place">America</name>, the solidarity of families, and the virtue and industry of the men and women commemorated within its idyllic precincts.</p><p><name type="place" target="9069" subtype="site">Mount Auburn</name> served as the progenitor of rural cemeteries in other cities: <name type="place" target="9071" subtype="site">Laurel Hill</name> in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> (<date when="1836">1836</date>), <name type="place" target="9072" subtype="site">Green Wood</name> in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> (<date when="1838">1838</date>), <name type="place" target="9073" subtype="site">Spring Grove</name> in Cincinnati (<date when="1845">1845</date>), and <name type="place" target="9074" subtype="site">Cave Hill</name> in Louisville (<date when="1848">1848</date>). In addition, it exerted an influence over the old barren burial grounds in cities, and these, now no longer in active use, were given iron fences, grass, trees, and shrubs, becoming the pleasant green urban oases they are today.</p><p>Although there were plenty who left written records demonstrating that the didacticism of Mount<pb n="337"/><pb n="337" type="orig"/>Auburn effectively touched them much as <name type="pname" target="9100">Bigelow</name> and the other founders had hoped, even in the early years of its existence, people did not necessarily go there for moral uplift.

But at that time he had no idea that he would pursue landscape as a career. Having first established himself with his father's financial help on <name type="place">Staten Island</name> as a gentleman farmer employing the scientific principles similar to those pioneered by <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>, he had felt impelled to travel abroad in <date when="1850">1850</date> to study English agricultural practices at firsthand, recording his observations in a book, <hi rend="italic">Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England.</hi> Its critical success led him to pursue further journalistic endeavors based upon travel. Choosing the pen name "Yeoman," he dispatched a series of letters to the newly formed <hi rend="italic" target="9041">New York Daily Times</hi>, from various points along the routes he took through the American South and the frontier states as far west as <name type="place">Texas</name>. His constant theme was the superiority of free labor over slave agriculture, but interwoven into his text were passionately vivid descriptions of the countryside. Self-taught in his uncle's library where he may<figure xml:id="fig-405"><graphic url="CH9_033.jpg"/></figure><pb n="339"/><pb n="339" type="orig"/>have first encountered the writings of <name type="pname" target="7091">Price</name> and <name type="pname" target="7082">Gilpin</name>, he was, like his father who had taken him on carriage rides as a boy in search of the Picturesque, a discriminating connoisseur of natural scenery. Now, however, the Panic of <date when="1857">1857</date> had forced the publishing house for which he worked to close. Being prevented from pursuing his literary career as a publisher and the editor of <hi rend="italic" target="9047">Putnam's Monthly Magazine</hi>, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> was grateful to receive the job of superintendent of the clearing operations for <name type="place" target="7086" subtype="site">Central Park</name> under the supervision of <name type="pname" target="9129">Viele</name>, the engineer-in-chief.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> had learned a good deal about landscape design as he worked with <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> on the improvement of the public grounds in <name type="place">Washington D.C.</name>, as well as on the private estates where they collaborated, but he realized that <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s daily familiarity with the park landscape and his stature as an author and person of moral influence would make him an ideal partner in the design competition. Thus began the friendship of the architect and literary-man-turned-administrator as they paced together over the park's terrain and formed the vision embodied in the competition entry they labeled the Greensward Plan (fig. 9.33). By judiciously clearing away here and planting there, by moving earth to rearrange the land into gently rolling contours, by laying drains and converting swamps into ponds, there would emerge a landscape that was both pastoral and Picturesque.</p><p>To understand the Greensward Plan and the subsequent work of the two men after they became professional partners, one must attempt to enter the mind of <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> as fully as possible, for however much intelligence and design ability <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> contributed, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s brand of nineteenth-century spirituality and democratic humanitarianism supplied something fundamentally philosophic to their common vision of the designed landscape. This vision was akin to <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>'s in that it was rooted in a belief that parks in cities and the domesticated middle landscape of freestanding homes set in parklike surroundings away from the crowded urban workplace would act as a civilizing force in society. But <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s more comprehensive view of landscape was not derived from <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> or from <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>, <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>'s preceptor.</p><p><name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name> had recast <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>'s concepts to suit the conditions of American society and the country's natural landscape, recommending a Picturesque and sometimes rustic architectural vocabulary to harmonize with and accent picturesque scenery. But, like <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>, he was a horticulturist who valued plant display for its own sake. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>&#x2014;"Yeoman"&#x2014;found the Gardenesque style a fussy distraction from the park's real purpose, which was the creation of rural scenery that evoked a poetic mood lifting one out of everyday care and ennobling the spirit with intimations of the divine. This kind of scenic contemplation was therapy for the overworked paterfamilias, a healthful occupation for women, a positive educational influence upon children, and a means of acculturation for the masses. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> never presented himself as having botanical expertise, preferring plants arranged for their overall artistic effect to those presented as individual scientific specimens.<ref target="#CH9-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref>The task of incorporating the recently enriched botanical palette into garden compositions in which specimen trees or beds of flowers were objects of attention was for him irrelevant to the business of park making.</p><figure xml:id="fig-406"><graphic url="CH9_034.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.33.

Utilitarian and decorative elements should be placed within an overall impression of tranquilly beautiful and ruggedly Picturesque rural scenery. In later years, when he served as mentor to aspiring young landscape architects, he did not direct them to the works of the prominent nineteenth-century authors, <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> and <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>, but rather to those of <name type="pname" target="7091">Price</name><pb n="340"/><pb n="340" type="orig"/>and <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name>. Like these eighteenth-century writers, he saw landscape not as a collection of features artistically arranged for display, but rather as a shifting panorama, a sequence of views and vistas that opened up harmoniously as one moved through the countryside or city park. His own deepest religious experiences were, like those of his father, Wordsworthian and transcendentalist&#x2014;rapt responses to the beautiful and sublime in nature. He also loved the rich, picturesque mystery of things half-concealed by overhanging vines. His keen emotional response to lush tropical effects caused him to attempt to simulate the scenery he had seen in the Louisiana bayous and on the Isthmus of Panama in an Americaninflected version of the eighteenth-century English Picturesque. By exploiting such optical characteristics as the play of light and shade in the shadows cast by trees across a sunlit meadow, the atmospheric haze of a distant umbrageous horizon line, and the mystery suggested by an intricate fringe of vines screening a shadowy entrance to a grotto, he created a design idiom that was both naturalistic and Romantic.</p><figure xml:id="fig-407"><graphic url="CH9_035.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.34.

It was difficult to achieve in Central Park because of its broken topography and narrow rectangular shape. Above Ninety-eighth Street, however, there was a piece of tableland that lent itself to becoming the North and East Meadows, while below the Sixty-Fifth Street <name type="place" target="9087" subtype="subsite">Transverse Road</name> the designers proposed blasting away bedrock in order to fill and level the surface for a <name type="place" target="9088" subtype="subsite">Ball Ground</name>.

The carved panels encasing the grand double stairs descending to the Bethesda Fountain and the lakeshore depict a rich profusion of animal and vegetal forms symbolizing the seasons of the year.

This viewpoint imposes a later value system on their objectives and ignores the fact that, at the time they designed Central Park, the physical recreational movement still lay in the future. For their romantically inclined generation, scenic strolling was a healthful pastime much enjoyed by all classes. They were sincere in their belief that this pleasure, which <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> deemed to be akin to being moved by poetry, would soften the lives of the less fortunate members of society, which included many newcomers from other countries. They were convinced that the park's pastoral and Picturesque scenery would serve as an informal public school, instructing immigrants through an unconscious process of scenic enjoyment in the shared values, which were still predominantly agrarian, of the new democratic society-in-formation.</p><p>It is undeniable that there were certain prospective users who felt few transcendental stirrings in the presence of scenery and who saw the park merely as a social arena, a place to parade their wealth and marriageable daughters, often exercising ill-disguised class prejudice. But this did not mean that the idealism expressed in the vision of <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> was not genuine. They did not discourage such immediately popular activities as ice-skating and boating on the Lake, and the rules <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> promulgated as superintendent were designed to protect the park from overuse and abuse rather than to discriminate against a class of users. Most important, the Greensward Plan was supple in its ability to absorb new uses over the years. Unlike many of the landscapes presented to the public by the twentieth-century park builder <name type="pname" target="9105">Robert Moses</name>, which typically consist of single-purpose recreation facilities, the spaces <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> created are able to serve a variety of purposes. In his writings, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> divided the park's landscape into two kinds of space: "neighborly" and "gregarious," the former being for small groups consisting of families and friends who came to the park to picnic and enjoy scenery, while the latter was designed to serve the parade of strangers who congregated in the manner of Parisians on boulevards to enjoy the spectacle of one another. The park was thus intended as a place in which to delight in both nature and one's common humanity.</p><p>Absent from the Greensward Plan were <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>'s proposed "noble works of art, statues, monuments and buildings," although in <date when="1880">1880</date> <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> built the first structure housing the <name type="place" target="9093" subtype="site">Metropolitan Museum</name> inside the park near Fifth Avenue and East Eighty-second Street. In addition, a conservatory originally planned near Fifth Avenue and East Seventy-fourth Street was constructed in <date when="1899">1899</date> in the north end of the park near Fifth Avenue and East 105th Street on the site where <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> had set up a temporary nursery and botanic garden. Throughout the park, the rural motif ruled in the predominant interest of "neighborly" recreation, but an important area was reserved for "gregarious" purposes: the elm-arcaded <name type="place" target="9094" subtype="subsite">Mall</name>, a straight concourse extending from Sixty-fifth to Seventy-second Street, which was set on a diagonal axis<pb n="343"/><pb n="343" type="orig"/>to detract attention from the park's rectilinear boundaries. Focused upon Vista Rock in the distance, which <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> later crowned with the neo-Gothic, castlelike <name type="place" target="9095" subtype="subsite">Belvedere</name>, this grand promenade, designed for sociable congregation, leads strollers to a broad stairway and through the Arcade beneath the Seventy-second Street Cross Drive to the lakeside <name type="place" target="9096" subtype="subsite">Terrace</name>, <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name>'s architectural masterpiece (fig. 9.40).</p><p>Here, with his collaborator <name type="pname" target="9142">Mould</name>, <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> designed a pair of monumental staircases carved with ornamental panels, profuse with motifs of vegetation and wildlife representing the four seasons. These grand stairs provided an alternative means of reaching the Terrace, useful for those alighting from carriages parked on the Cross Drive rather than passing on foot from the Mall through the Arcade. In the center of the circular <name type="place" target="9096" subtype="subsite">Terrace</name>, a jet sent a plume of water into the air until it was replaced in the <date when="1870">1870</date>s by a fountain surmounted by a sculpture representing the angel that bestowed healing power upon the pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem.<ref target="#CH9-n27"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">27</hi></hi></ref>This work by <name type="pname" target="9143">Emma Stebbins</name> (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">1882</date>) celebrated the public health benefits brought to the city a generation earlier by the Croton Aqueduct, and the figures at the fountain's base symbolize the blessings of Temperance, Purity, Health, and Peace. Two tall poles with ornamental bases and crossbars for long vertical fishtail banners stand next to the Lake where the designers effected a seemingly effortless transition from modest grandeur to Picturesque simplicity. This achievement is evident also in the way the designers made the geometric lines of the Mall and Terrace merge gracefully with the curving paths and naturalistic scenery alongside them.</p><p>In the south end of the park, the designers paid particular attention to the needs of women and children, visitors who might not wish to wander far from its principal entrance at Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue. Immediately south of the Sixty-fifth Street Transverse Road and serviceable from it, <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> constructed the <name type="place" target="9097" subtype="subsite">Dairy</name>, a small building of rusticated stone with an ample wooden loggia providing shelter from the sun and inclement weather. Here children could play with toys furnished by a park attendant or drink fresh cow's milk. The designers christened a large nearby outcrop of Manhattan schist the Kinderberg. Polished by glacial scouring to form a natural slide, it had broad steps carved into its base and a rustic shelter crowning its top. The fenced playgrounds that are popular attractions in today's park were added after <date when="1934">1934</date> by <name type="pname" target="9105">Moses</name>, but in the nineteenth century, park workers set up portable swings and seesaws in season.</p><p>In the original Greensward Plan, the northern border of the park is at 106th Street where an arboretum was specified but never built on the east side, while on the west side there was nothing beyond the Great Hill, which <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> encircled with an appendage to the West Drive to afford carriage riders panoramic prospects from this high point in the park. The commissioners soon realized that the topography between 106th and 110th Streets would not readily permit urban development because it was both too elevated by bedrock protrusions and too swampy where the resistant Manhattan schist gives way to the easily erodible Inwood marble that underlies the Harlem plain. They wisely acquired this additional land in <date when="1863">1863</date>, increasing the park's size from 750 acres to 843 acres. This allowed <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> to save the sites of several fortifications left from the Revolution and the War of <date when="1812">1812</date>, to promote as a forest of native American trees an already wooded area, and to create the <name type="place" target="9098" subtype="subsite">Harlem Meer</name> in the park's new northeast corner, a much larger water body than the Pond in the southeast (fig. 9.41).</p><p>An army of a thousand workers, directed at first by <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>, moved nearly 5 million cubic yards, or approximately 10 million one-horse cartloads of stone, earth, and topsoil out of or into the park between <date when="1858">1858</date> and <date when="1873">1873</date>.

Public sanitation victories through the kind of engineering technology represented by <name type="place">New York</name>'s Croton Aqueduct system and other Industrial-Age improvements such as smooth macadam roadbeds instead of cobblestone paving made large cities more livable than before.</p><p>But they still presented many difficulties for their inhabitants, the most notable being deprivation of contact with nature as the countryside became<pb n="346"/><pb n="346" type="orig"/>increasingly distant from the city. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> felt that a single park's role as a civilizing influence, ameliorating the noise and hectic pace of the metropolis, was still somewhat limited. They envisioned the carriage drives within parks being extended to become parkways, tree-canopied transportation corridors connected to other parks, the whole forming a new framework superimposed over the grid, a green skeleton guiding the city's expansion. They saw, moreover, that roadway layout necessarily dictated the pattern and nature of urban growth, with residential development of a more elegant nature being spawned by a circulation system that segregated private estates from commercial through traffic. In their grasp of the city as an evolving regional organism they were the country's first urban planners.</p><figure xml:id="fig-418"><graphic url="CH9_046.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.45.

Six rows of trees were to be planted along the length of the parkway, dividing the 260-foot (79-meter) right-ofway into a center drive for carriages, with two lanes on each side, one of which was designated a pedestrian walk, while the other served as a side road for the approach of vehicles to the adjoining house lots. These were to be 100 feet (30.4 meters) in width, allowing for the construction of freestanding "villa" residences with private gardens. Service lanes where horses could be stabled, goods delivered, and garbage removed were to be located in back of the house lots.</hi></figDesc></figure><p>The parity implied by the <date when="1811">1811</date> grid plan for <name type="place">New York</name> City was congenial to the expressed democratic values of the new republic. Moreover, it was a practical convenience for developers. Nevertheless, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> wrote scathingly about its disadvantages. He felt the <name type="place">New York</name> grid to be especially uncongenial to the needs of people because the block sizes dictated by its street layout forced property to be divided into deep lots, usually no wider than 25 feet (7.6 meters). This resulted in rows of cramped narrow houses with poor light and ventilation. He wished to remedy this condition by carrying the park influence to the level of a system, with greenery easily accessible throughout the metropolitan area. Where land had not yet been platted, lots for homes could be created that would permit healthful cross ventilation, penetration by sunlight, and a green lawn. Unlike the grid with its straight streets intersecting at right angles and static perspectives, the parkway system would conform to topography and scenic opportunity, which could be captured by the kind of curving alignments that allowed the landscape to unfold from a series of ever-changing vantage points.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The First Parkways</hi></p><p>The creation of the Brooklyn park offered <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> the opportunity to advocate a more comprehensive vision for the metropolitan landscape. In their preliminary report to the commissioners dated <date when="1866-01-24">January 24, 1866</date>, they articulated under the heading "Suburban Connections" the desirability of a pleasure drive connecting <name type="place" target="9101" subtype="site">Prospect Park</name> with the beach on the Atlantic Ocean. Imaginatively, they saw how another drive could run east along the beach, then pass through undeveloped countryside, continuing parallel with the East River until it touched the shore at Ravenswood, Queens, where either by ferry or high bridges as yet unbuilt it would connect with one of the wide crosstown Manhattan streets leading to Central Park. Further, they envisioned this extensive greenway dedicated to pleasure driving extending west from Central Park to the Hudson River, where it could run for a distance parallel to that river with views of the Palisades on the opposite shore and, in the distance, the blue outline of the Shawangunk Mountains.</p><p>Two years later after work on the park had begun, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> used the report they delivered to the board as an opportunity to expound this metropolitan-scale planning concept. They now proposed a scheme, which went beyond their original one of a recreational parkway linking two major parks with the region's ocean beaches and extensive river waterfront, to encompass the notion of <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>'s destiny as an ideal residential community. Even allowing for shipping and commercial activity equal to that of Manhattan across the river, much of the city&#x2014;although it had not yet become a borough of Greater <name type="place">New York</name>&#x2014;could function as a bedroom suburb.

A third parkway was proposed to link the park with Fort Hamilton and the site of the future Marine Park overlooking the Verrazano Narrows to the south.</p><p>The designers further remarked that new public transportation improvements made possible the occupation of a much larger urban area at lower densities than heretofore. Separation of residence and workplace was a corollary of this enlargement of towns. <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>, "set apart and guarded by nature as a place for the tranquil habitation of those whom the business of the world requires should reside within convenient access of the waters of <name type="place">New York</name> harbor"<ref target="#CH9-n35"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">35</hi></hi></ref> was ideally situated to become a pleasant residential suburb. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> hoped that with its domestic character established by the parkway and street system recommended in their report, the kind of energetic self-made young men who had left their leafy country towns for the commercial opportunities of the city would be drawn to purchase property in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>'s new middle landscape. It was a model that could be replicated as <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> and other cities grew, extending themselves to encompass their surrounding rural countryside. The loss of that countryside to urbanization was compensated for by the abundant greenery of the now more loosely woven fabric of the metropolitan landscape with its parkways connecting city dwellers to the generously scaled new urban parks filled with rural scenery.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Buffalo's Park System</hi></hi></head><p>The firm that <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> had formed was now called upon to consult in other cities.

He traveled to the city for a site meeting and admired its departure from the grid in its layout. He then proceeded to sketch a plan that grafted onto this street pattern a system of parkway-linked parks. The new plan thus consisted of not one, but all three park sites with parkways connecting them to one another (fig. 9.46). The 350-acre <name type="place" target="9110" subtype="site">Delaware Park</name> gave the designers an opportunity to create a large meadow and a 46-acre lake and to provide an extensive circuit drive with grade separation of intersecting pedestrian paths as in Central and Prospect Parks. A second park, the <name type="place" target="9111" subtype="site">Front</name>, occupied 36 acres overlooking the Niagara River near its entry into Lake Erie and was designed as a viewing terrace, which could also accommodate large gatherings.

Here was an opportunity to demonstrate on 1,600 acres of farmland the truly metropolitan character of their vision, which was far different from <name type="pname" target="7169">Downing</name>'s merely suburban ideal. In doing so, they went beyond the explicit commission of the <name type="pname" target="9238">Riverside Improvement Company</name> to design a parkway connecting city and suburb.

Like the <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> parkways, the <name type="place">Chicago</name> parkway&#x2014;several miles of which were constructed&#x2014;had segregated lanes, with pedestrians and horseback riders occupying the lane next to the central roadway and carts and wagons the outside utility lane.</p><p>For the circulation system within the community, the designers created curving, well-drained, treelined roads with sidewalks bordering lawns, which they specified to be 30 feet (9.1 meters) deep and planted with at least two trees. Like a <name type="place">New England</name> town, <name type="place" target="9114" subtype="site">Riverside</name> had its common. There were, moreover, because of the configuration of the road system, many triangular pieces of land that were intentionally exempted from the process of parceling house lots, and these served as additional public green space. But the largest reservation of land for common recreational enjoyment was the 160-acre stretch of land paralleling the Des Plaines River, envisioned as a waterfront park.</p><p>Management difficulties and financial problems made the partners resign their commission in <date when="1870">1870</date>. A thousand acres east of the river and a small piece of land to the west were eventually developed according to their plan, but many half-acre lots were divided into two lots, and the large park remained unbuilt. Today, however, this leafy suburb, which is now surrounded by ordinary grid-style urbanization, stands out as an example of the intelligent approach to the design of the new American metropolitan landscape in the middle of the nineteenth century when <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> infused the process of real-estate development with social and recreational considerations of lasting consequence.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Chicago Parks</hi></hi></head><p>At the same time that the partners were working on <name type="place" target="9114" subtype="site">Riverside</name>, <name type="place">Chicago</name> was becoming a commercial dynamo vigorously seeking the civic symbolism that would assert its supremacy within the Union.

Their survey of the area took in the islands in the harbor, beaches, forests, three river basins, several hills, five ponds, and other sites they found desirable as nature preserves or suitable for public recreation.</p><figure xml:id="fig-426"><graphic url="CH9_054.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.53.

These younger men converted some of the nation's growing industrial wealth into mansions for the wealthy and civic grandeur for the public at large. Among these was <name type="pname" target="9156">Richard Morris Hunt</name> (<date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">1895</date>), the first American of renown to design in the style called Beaux-Arts after the <name type="place" target="9127" subtype="site">&#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts</name> in <name type="place">Paris</name> where a number of aspiring architects from the United States went to study in the second half of the nineteenth century. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> were not happy when a newly formed Committee on Statuary, Fountains and Architectural Structures invited <name type="pname" target="7020">Hunt</name> to propose alterations to the <name type="place" target="9128" subtype="subsite">Arsenal</name> in <name type="place" target="7086" subtype="site">Central Park</name> in <date when="1860">1860</date>; the Civil War caused these plans to be shelved for the duration. More upsetting was <name type="pname" target="7020">Hunt</name>'s proposal, drawn up at the committee's request, for a series of monumental Neoclassical gateways at the park's four southern entrances. <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name>'s<pb n="352"/><pb n="352" type="orig"/>opposition persuaded the park commissioners not to construct these monumental entrances.</p><figure xml:id="fig-427"><graphic url="CH9_055.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.54. U.S. Capitol, Terrace on the west front, designed by <name type="pname" target="7087">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>. <date when="1873">1873</date></hi></figDesc></figure><p><name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> felt that statuary in the park should be confined to the <name type="place" target="9094" subtype="subsite">Mall</name> and <name type="place" target="9096" subtype="subsite">Bethesda Terrace</name>, and he expressed his fear of other monumental Beaux-Arts architectural encroachments by <name type="pname" target="7020">Hunt</name> on the park's pastoral landscape. Nevertheless, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> was able to work within the context of a Neoclassical design vocabulary when necessary. In <date when="1873">1873</date>, he accepted the commission of the <name type="pname" target="9243">Senate Committee on Buildings and Grounds</name> to design the 46 acres around the <name type="place" target="9040" subtype="site">United States Capitol</name> in <name type="place">Washington D.C.</name> In this case, it was obviously necessary to ignore his precept of fitting buildings inconspicuously into the landscape, as the chief purpose of the project was to heighten the monumentality and dignity of the nation's most important public building. In addition to banning Gardenesque effects, which he considered fussy distractions from this principal object, he built the massive terrace that forms a podium along the Capitol's north, south, and west sides and unifies the building with its surroundings (fig. 9.54).</p><p>In the two final commissions of his career, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> worked directly with Beaux-Arts architects. In <date when="1888">1888</date>, twenty-five-year-old <name type="pname" target="9151">George Washington Vanderbilt</name> commissioned him to design the grounds at <name type="place" target="9129" subtype="site">Biltmore</name>, his estate near Asheville, North Carolina. Here <name type="pname" target="7020">Hunt</name> was the architect of a palatial mansion resembling a French Renaissance <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau.</hi> <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s plan encompassed 2,000 acres of mountainous landscape. Inasmuch as the site did not lend itself to becoming a park in the pastoral and Picturesque tradition, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> recommended that <name type="pname" target="9151">Vanderbilt</name> should devote most of it to scientific forestry. The millionaire eventually increased his holdings to 120,000 acres and hired America's first professional forester, <name type="pname" target="9054">Gifford Pinchot</name>, who later became the founding head of the <name type="pname" target="9244">United States Forest Service</name>. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> also convinced <name type="pname" target="9151">Vanderbilt</name> to create an arboretum.</p><p>At <name type="place" target="9129" subtype="site">Biltmore</name>, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s particular genius as a landscape designer expressed itself in the estate's road system: a 3-mile (4.8-kilometer) approach road, the borders of which he enhanced with "varied forms of vegetation... all consistent with the sensation of passing through the remote depths of a natural forest."<ref target="#CH9-n40"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">40</hi></hi></ref>Here, as in <name type="place" target="7086" subtype="site">Central Park</name> and elsewhere, he wanted to plant lush masses of many species of rhododendron and a rich variety of other woodland shrubs in order to create the "sense of the superabundant creative power, infinite resource, and liberality of Nature"<ref target="#CH9-n41"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">41</hi></hi></ref>that tropical scenery had always evoked in him. The long approach road at last brings the visitor, who has had no anticipatory view of what lies ahead, to a rectangular grassy esplanade, beyond which <name type="pname" target="7020">Hunt</name>'s immense <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> of Indiana limestone looms suddenly into view. At <name type="place" target="9126" subtype="site">Moraine Farm</name>, the view of the lake was not revealed until one passed through the house onto the terrace overlooking it; so, too, at <name type="place" target="9129" subtype="site">Biltmore</name>, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> withheld the panoramic scenery of the Great Smokies with Mount Pisgah in the distance until one had passed through the house onto the terrace there. Thus, although more architecturally elaborate than the rustic terrace built earlier in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, the terrace at Biltmore serves the same purpose as a viewing platform for a heretofore concealed spectacle of nature at its most glorious.</p><p>At the same time that he worked at <name type="place" target="9129" subtype="site">Biltmore</name>, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> became a member of the design team, headed by the architect <name type="pname" target="9134">Daniel H. Burnham</name>, that was planning the <name type="place" target="9130" subtype="site">World's Columbian Exposition</name> of <date when="1893">1893</date> for <name type="place">Chicago</name>. This World's Fair, like the expositions organized first in <name type="place">England</name> and then in <name type="place">Paris</name> in the second half of the nineteenth century, was intended as an international showcase of the products of industry. But unlike the earlier fairs, which had produced technologically innovative structures&#x2014;notably the Crystal Palace and the Eiffel Tower&#x2014;<name type="pname" target="9134">Burnham</name> and his Beaux-Arts-trained colleagues wished to put the architectural stamp of Neoclassical grandeur, rather than of modernity, upon this one. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> was consulted on site selection and, with the assistance of his talented young prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; and partner <name type="pname" target="9135">Henry Sargent Codman</name>, chose the still-unimproved site of <name type="place" target="9118" subtype="site">Jackson Park</name>. This gave him an opportunity to revisit the <date when="1871">1871</date> design he had prepared in partnership with <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name>. Now, however, it was necessary to adopt a much more pronounced orientation toward "gregarious" recreation, with the further understanding that, as at the United States Capitol, the grounds would showcase the buildings. The <name type="place" target="9131" subtype="subsite">large lagoon</name> he had planned twenty years earlier was still possible and desirable if<pb n="353"/><pb n="353" type="orig"/>it were treated as a series of waterbodies, some of which were to be given a geometric architectural treatment to complement the buildings. With their uniform cornice lines and white color, the largest of these made an impressive grouping around <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s most conspicuous water feature, a long central basin with a canal leading to other parts of the lagoon system, each of which served as a watery foreground for another composition of fair buildings (fig. 9.55).</p><p>Still, <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> found an opportunity to provide relief from the noisy crowds and architectural grandiloquence of the fair in the wooded island in the center of the lagoon. There he tried within the short growing period before opening day to create an air of poetic mystery and the appearance of a natural bayou by establishing a rich aquatic vegetation and dense shoreline growth (fig. 9.56). Here, fair visitors could find a ramble of sinuous paths and the illusion of nature in the midst of the hubbub and excitement of the fair. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> wished to keep the island free of structures, protesting when a music hall was contemplated in that location. Praising the achievement of the <name type="place" target="9130" subtype="site">Chicago World's Fair</name> as the grounds were being completed, the writer on architecture, gardens, and landscape design, <name type="pname" target="9136">Mariana Griswold Van Rensselaer</name>, told future visitors, "You will already know that much of the ground immediately beneath you was not even solid, ugly prairie, but treacherous marsh. And looking over this ground now&#x2014;here with its straight, stately, wide canals and architectonic terraces, and there with its irregularly-shaped lagoons and islands&#x2014;you will understand how a great artist like <name type="pname" target="7087">Mr. Olmsted</name> can absolutely create in a way which almost equals Nature's own."<ref target="#CH9-n42"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">42</hi></hi></ref></p><figure xml:id="fig-428"><graphic url="CH9_056.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">9.55.

A six-month holiday abroad with his daughter and son for the purpose of regaining his health gave him the opportunity to revisit with renewed delight the English countryside he had first admired as a young man.

Although the trailing vines recommended by <name type="pname" target="9020">Robinson</name> exactly suited <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>'s taste and he found <hi rend="italic" target="9068">The Wild Garden</hi> useful in selecting plants for such places as the Ramble in <name type="place" target="7086" subtype="site">Central Park</name>, he was now more convinced than ever that he had been right to take what was useful from the writings of <name type="pname" target="7082">Gilpin</name> and <name type="pname" target="7091">Price</name> and to have developed an American landscape style emphasizing broad, overarching scenic themes. He even made a pilgrimage to the church at Boldre where <name type="pname" target="7082">Gilpin</name> had been vicar, and he traveled along the route beside the river Wye that <name type="pname" target="7082">Gilpin</name> had described in one of his books. Visiting <name type="place">Paris</name>, where he examined the grounds of the exposition of <date when="1889">1889</date>, he hoped that in <name type="place">Chicago</name> the "petty effects and frippery" of ornamental floral display would be avoided.

The achievements of <name type="pname" target="7187">Calvert Vaux</name> were overshadowed by these architects, and the former partners' belief in the overriding therapeutic and spiritual values of naturalistic landscapes in an urban setting was denied by the Gilded Age's desire for monumental grandeur. While he still held the position of landscape architect to the board in charge of <name type="place">New York</name> City parks, <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> had protested against the design of a speedway planned now for the edge of the Harlem River, but his objections were high-handedly brushed aside, and he died under mysterious circumstances in <date when="1895">1895</date>. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> fell victim to dementia, retired from public life, and was confined during the five years preceding his death in <date when="1903">1903</date> in the McLean Hospital at Waverly, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, where he had designed the grounds. But before his intellectual powers were eclipsed, he had seen clearly that the Beaux-Arts architects' appetite for monumentality was antithetical to the older ideal of a republican <name type="place">America</name> that he and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> had tried to embody in their parks.</p><p>In <date when="1894">1894</date>, <name type="pname" target="7168">Stanford White</name> (<date when="1853">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1906">1906</date>), the most fashionable Beaux Arts architect in the generation after <name type="pname" target="7020">Hunt</name> was approached to build a tennis house in <name type="place" target="9101" subtype="site">Prospect Park</name>.

In <date when="1840">1840</date>, <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> republished <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name>'s <hi rend="italic" target="7059">Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</hi> (<date when="1803">1803</date>) under the title <hi rend="italic" target="9065">The Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphrey Repton</hi>.

But neither <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name> nor <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> after him seems to have employed the term in presenting themselves to clients. <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name> had christened himself "Landscape Gardener" upon entering professional practice, and <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name> considered himself to be primarily an agronomist, botanist, horticulturalist, and author. <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> and <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> wished to distinguish between their kind of work&#x2014; which often involved extensive engineering and significant reformation of the land to produce a naturalistic effect akin to that of rural scenery&#x2014;and <name type="pname" target="7186">Loudon</name>'s kind of ornamental horticulture and that of <name type="pname" target="7093">Repton</name> late in his career when he deemed appropriate a Gardenesque treatment in areas adjacent to the house. Nevertheless, the notion that they were <hi rend="italic">artists,</hi> not simply engineers or administrators, was important to them. In discussing the use of the title with <name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name>. who apparently objected to it as being too vague, <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name> said as they were about to reenter partnership in <date when="1865">1865</date>, "I have always liked the title Landscape Architect because&#x2014;the specialty was fairly embodied. A title that could as easily be transferred to an inartistic public work is not as satisfactory.... The term Landscape Architect does not suit you, well I am sorry for it. I think it is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> title. We want to set art ahead and make it <hi rend="italic">command</hi> its position, administration, management, funds, commission, popularity and everything else&#x2014;then we have a tangible something to stand on." (See <name type="pname" target="9167">Charles C. McLaughlin</name>et al. <hi rend="italic" target="9067">The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted</hi>, vol. V, pp.<pb n="356"/><pb n="356" type="orig"/>363,373&#x2013;74.)

(<name type="pname" target="7087">Olmsted</name> deferred to <name type="pname" target="7187">Vaux</name>'s preference for the term when they reestablished their partnership in <date when="1865">1865</date> as <name type="pname" target="9206">Olmsted, Vaux, &amp; Company, Landscape Architects</name>.
